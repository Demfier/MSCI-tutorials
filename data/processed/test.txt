It is a cordless, so suction wise, it won't replace my central vac, BUT it works great for in-between cleanings.
It is certainly A LOT lighter than my central vac or the regular vac I used to have.
I purchased this item via my daily gold box special and it was definitely worth the money I paid for it.
Excellent suction and it's very easy to use.
The fact that it is cordless is also very convienent.
For me, I live in an apartment and this small sized vacuum is perfect for doing the daily or weekly pick me ups.
Despite its small size, it is very strong and lifts up most things with little trouble.
Sometimes I have to go over the carpet again just to get it extra clean but it's very good.
This would definitely come in handy in the kitchen.
Cordless means it runs on batteriess, and will lack some power and life.
There is only so much you can do on a battery, know that before thinking this is an equal replacement for a corded vacuum.
I prefered the cordless because I need to quickly and frequently cover a small one bedroom home.
This replaced a swivel sweeper which I had for over a year.
I was amazed by how much this Eureka picked up that the swivel sweeper had been missing.
I have a cat and this works well to pick up hair on the floor and clean up around the litter box.
I have all hardwoods with one area rug.
I was a little bit dissappointed that it was not about to pickup all of the cat hair from the rug.
This would be the best battery one that you could get.
After reading these reviews, I purchased this vacuum cleaner.
It's a cordless vacuum cleaner; those generally suck, and not in the good way.
AND it can charge both at once, if you mount the charging stand on a wall.
I bought another battery when I bought the vacuum, so I have three total.The battery is a snap to replace and charge.
I used this vacuum to clean them, and by the end of all three batteries, I was vowing to marry this vacuum cleaner.
It has surprising suction, it's light and easy to handle, and it gets the edges pretty well.
My upstairs carpet was covered in moving detritus, hair, bird feathers and just...random, random stuff.
It did as well as my regular upright vac does in picking all that up.
While I was using the carpet roller, I was able to thoroughly vacuum about 3/4 a flight of stairs.
When I say thoroughly, I mean every surface of the stair, multiple times over.
I would recommend this vacuum to anyone without hesitation.
While it is BEST suited to quick/light dirt jobs and to hard surfaces, it's more than capable of heavy soil and carpet.
Buy extra batteries; they're not expensive and they're extremely convenient.
My entire living room - all cherry hardwood 20x30 and kitchen tile is cleaned in under 3 minutes.
I widh we had one of these vacs years ago.
I use it on the linoleum in my kitchen (almost daily) and on the hardwood throughout the rest of the house.
It is light, easy to empty and clean the filter.
My only complaint it does not fit in tight spaces.
I used to have a Shark where the beater at the end was removeable.
Other than that, it does a great job.
I'm amazed at the amount of dirt this unit picks up.
Replacement filters 61544A are easy to find online.I have 2 shorthaired dogs.
It's one of the only vac's that will pick up their hair.
If you're looking for a vacuum to do wall-to-wall carpets with padding, this isn't what you want.
We have a lot of hard wood floor with area rugs and this is fantastic for a quick pick up.
Over tile floor it will actually pick up the litter in the grout as well.
The fact that it has a long handle makes it more comfortable to vacuum with.
Another fabulous design idea is that while the vacuum is hanging on the wall mount bracket, it's actually charging at the same time.
In essence this means you're fully charged at all times.
I always wanted to get her a real vacuum, but they can be dangerous.
This one is perfect because it actually works and lets her be an effective cleaning partner without the danger a small attachment can produce.
The cleaning head on this is fairly child safe.
I'v had sharks, black and deckers, swivel sweeper and eureka is the best and the least expensive.
Easy to use and maintain, definately gets up dust and most anything else.
It helps, if you have a large object, to pick up the vacuum a little and place it over the object.
This isn't necessary with cheerio type stuff but maybe a 1/2 cracker or something.
They last years, as least mine has and the filters are inexpensive.
I wish it was more agile to get under or around tight spaces.
It's really a dustbuster on a stick but the dustbuster can't be removed.
I use it several times a day for spot cleaning.
I do wish that the power head came off so I could use it like a regular dustbuster too.
It also has a problem picking up anything to large on bare floors, even small pebbles.
It tends to push it in front of the power head.
I have to lift it up and place it on the dirt to pick it up.
I was lured into buying this by Amazon's low price and boy, am I glad I did.
It is an amazing little cordless vacuum! I use it several times a day for cleaning up after children.
I can't say enough good things about this vacuum!.
Please read all the other reviews and than go and order one(even if you have to pay a shipping charge).
It won't replace your regular vacuum but you won't have to pull it out that often either.
This is the best purchase I have made this year!.
I live in a motor home and conventional vacuum cleaners are large and require storage.
This vacuum is wireless, hangs on the wall in its charger and is ready for use whenever needed.
It does a perfect job and is easy to clean.
I wanted something easy and lightweight to pick up bird seed and feathers from my birds and the little messes that my dog makes.
I had the Swivel Sweeper and it was junk because it burned out after 3 months of use.
I gave this Eureka product a try and I've had it for about a year and a half now and it keeps going strong.
This is the best stick vacuum that I've ever had.
I'm going to get a second one for another room.
It holds the charge for a while and it picks up everything great.
In 45 seconds or less every day, my bathroom floor is clean and ready for guests.
Better than a hand vac (dustbuster) if bending down isn't easy for you.
Noise level is very reasonable; the charge lasts up to 15 minutes or so of continuous use.
If I had a bigger home, I'd keep at least one on each floor.
We bought this when our first child learned to crawl and we had to clean crumbs, etc off the floor before she ate them.
To eliminate the "Memory" I just ran down the battery between charges rather than keeping it on the charger "topping off" all the time.
Works great now, as good as new!UPDATE2 - after 5-1/2 years the original battery is finally dead.
I already had 2 of these, and realized I could use another for all the spices I still had in the cabinets.
It arrived as usual very quickly from Amazon, and in perfect condition.
I quickly washed it, and dryed and started to fill with all my extra spices.
I love the fact that it comes with the stickers to label, and I have found every spice name I needed in that list.
I have this one sitting on top of the other 2 and it is very handy to use when I am cooking.
Mine is a bit too tall to have in the cabinets, so I do have it on the counter.
I also love the fact you can use your spices without a measuring spoon, you can just turn the handle and get the right amount.
Or you can use the measuring spoon by opening the top lid.
They are very well made, and study, easy to keep clean, and just a very helpful item for the kitchen.
My daughter and I both love our Spice Carousel.
I got us both one and we use it all the time and it is so much easier to use then out of the bottle.
I purchased 2 of these units to free up some cabinet space.
I was able to open up 2 1/2 shelves of a space and conveniently organize all my spices.
I purchased 2 additional carousels for my girlfriend.Great product at a great price.
In fact I am planning on ordering two more and stacking them so I can have all my spices at my fingertips.
I put them in alphabetical order and now finding them is a breeze.
I purchased 4 of these carousels and I love them.
They are stackable, I have them two and two; they look nice on my counter and are easily accessible.
To me, one of the great things about them is the multiple ways of dispensing spices, shaker, dial or spoon out -- very convenient.
I am a kind of cook that I do not always measure an exact amount of herb or spice.
I bought this for my mom, and she loves it.
It's mounted under her kitchen counter, and saves her a lot of space in her cabinets.
The nice thing is that it is stack-able.
3 ways to get your spices out, 1/4 tsp, rotating chamber, shaker, and scoop.
The biggest problems are that the 1/4 tsp isn't exact.
It depends on the consistency of the spice and you have to knock the container on the counter to get it to fill the pocket.
Each container holds an entire average sized spice bottle (and then some).
We purchased two of these in the chrome finish and couldn't be happier.
We have had them for quite some time now and use them daily.
I purchased this to use in addition to one of this companies older model units which does not dispense the spices.
I likeThe dispensing feature of this new storage unit.
My wife and I love this spice carousel.
We have many of our most common spices organized in TWO of these racks.
It has made our cabinet organized, and cooking a bit more fun.
Sometimes we end up with multiples, because the one we needed was playing hide-and-go-seek until the new  one arrived.
So, at least a few times a week I comment I can't stand cooking when I can't find what I need.
However, when stacked bottles of spice are falling you don't have apace to not come up with a better plan.
So, I bought an island and I went in search of spice racks.
I saw these and it was a match made in heaven.
We received one of these over 15 years ago as a Christmas gift and it has been used constantly.
A new owner may have changed the specs.
We use ours for spices we use up quickly, however, like oregano and cumin, and feel it is adequate.
It is so convenient we'll live with that issue.
I have never measured what comes out from a one-click turn to see if it is a true 1/4 tsp.
It is close enough for doing things like dumping spices into a pot of soup.
The dial still turns, but the little compartmentalized wheel inside does not turn.
Nothing lasts forever, and this thing has worked well for a lot longer than lots of more expensive products--think about a 15-yeard-old car.
Been using this for four years, and I still rank as one of the most convenient objects in my kitchen.
Negative reviews included that they leak, and are cheaply made.So I just got mine, and so far I haven't had much problem.
If you are like me, you have all sorts of bottles and jars of spice of all sizes and shapes.
Some can spill right in, but that is rarely the case.
I was thinking that I could try a larger funnel, but that just made the problem worse.
Folding this in half I ended up with a perfect little spice chute that made the containers a breeze to fill up with no spillage.
At the same time it is fair to expect a product to live up to the basic requirements of the description no matter the price.
None of the containers are leaking, nor do any of them seem either mis-aligned or not sealed properly.
I get a satisfying "click" when I replace the top.
I have not been juggling with them or anything so I cannot speak to hard use yet, but so far they seem pretty adequate.
I do not have a mess by or near my spice rack.
I have no actual scientific measurements to back this up, and I could be wrong.
Also, there is a "door" thing below each dispenser that keeps the door shut between servings.
This door prevents leaks and also completes the seal for storage.
It makes sense, but there are a couple of issues with this current design.
One is that if the dial is turned while this door is closed, spice will back-up.
Meaning that if you open the door in this case, spice will come out regardless of if you are ready for it.
Also the door prevents one-handed operation as you have to hold the dispenser and open the door with your other hand to get it rolling.
If the item is indeed dispensing the correct quantity per "click" of the wheel, none of things are of issue to me.
They are in some space-age font that looks like it came from a free font site.
Like they are trying way too hard to be futuristic.
Also, if you have some offbeat spice names or custom blends, these labels wont cut it.
I have found that it does for the most-part.
If dealing with a powder/fine spice these spice jars do dispense 1/4 teaspoon as log as the dispenser is held upright.
I still hold to this statement for the most-part, with a small deviation.
The price would lead one to believe that these things must be pretty crappy.
I am happy to report that they are not.
They still do not feel like they are made from stainless steel, but they are quite sturdy and dependable.
I will add that the durability does not lie in the material as much as the overall design of the product.
I still feel that these items are worth the small price.
As a matter of fact, I tend to think that I got a really good deal.
They are really that good.End Result:I am upgrading my review from four stars to five.
this spice rack system is great its just what we needed we ordered two of themgreat space saver.
I have limited cupboard space and love my spices, but needed something to organize as well as save space.
This is wonderful and saves digging for measuring spoons too.
The dial on the front to measure is great, though things like minced onion or garlic don't work very well.
This is my second carousel, and they are linked together.
It makes it easy to see what spices we have and being able to measure by the 1/4 tsp make life very easy.
Need a teaspoon? turn the dial 4 times.
If you want to sprinkle, use the slotted tab.
This item can also be mounted under the counter as well as stacked.
Would recommend to anyone who cooks a lot and uses many spices.
I found that the carousel and the easy dispensing makes cooking easy and fun.
My children love to cook with me and they are a pro now on how to use this product and the proper use of spices.
The product works great, is well made, and sturdy.
Also I am glad that it comes in white.
I read reviews about this product and some said that these leak but if they are used properly they DO NOT leak.
Was looking iinto buying bulk becaus others in family, and friends, liked it so much that they wanted the product too.
I almost didn't buy these because of the bad reviews, but I like 'em.
They hold tons of spices in very little space and I find them convenient.
I haven't had a problem since I bought them.
Salts, sugars, herbs and anything else! It is space-saving with little size and easy to rotate.
However, I have to sing its praises for the useful tool it was.
It chopped ice as long as there was enough liquid with it and made great smoothies.
I also used it to puree almost everything.
Stuff stuck in the blades sometimes but was not a problem.
I never got the motor wet doing it this way.
I was very sad when it finally died after so many useful years-boo-hoo.
Mine came with a holder that is screwed into a cabinet-very handy.
I also want to continue using the holder in my cabinet.
A friend introduced me to this easy to use everyday blender and now I wonder why I waited so long to get one.
I know my sister-in-law is going to love this Christmas gift!.
First off, I am Not a big fan of the Forman grills (I have a very good Hamilton beach grill I use).
For the discounted price, you get a very well made METAL tubing grill (the base is plastic).
I read some reviews saying its not sturdy, well mine is, very nice design, no complaints.
The grill tray itself is very large, the size of a normal gas grill size.
Grease goes into the grease tray, works nice.
I bought this grill because I have the smaller indoor George Foreman grill which I use frequently and like alot.
I find this grill just as easy to use.
It has a much larger cooking surface and a temperature control knob, which the smaller indoor model does not have.
I have used it when I didn't have time to light my charcoal BBQ grill.
It grills well, browns the meat or vegetables but does not have a BBQ flavor.
I like it because it is a convenient outdoor grilling alternative.
This sure filled the void and the food tastes great.
Where it lacks in that grill flavor it makes up for it in keeping the food moist and perfect.
It's hard to over cook anything and fits perfect on my small balcony.Pros: Small size overall but large cooking area.
Simple and easy to use.Cons: It looks plain and boring but I mean it's a grill, the food is what counts.
It's bigger than I expected, which is good.
Lid hooks on to the edge so you don't have to set it down somewhere else.
My son was the first one to use it and liked it so much he wants to buy one.
The only thing I don't like about it is the power cord is only about 7 ft long.
I had to buy an extension cord in order to use it outside.
I used one for a few years then just trashed it after getting too dirty.
now I have two on different balconies of my high rise condo.
but at this price you could buy them every season and get a new one the next year.
It's absolutely ridiculous that people spend hundreds and even thousands on grills.
so much so that I think most of my friends have immediately gone out and bought these to replace their charcoal/gas grills at home.
No more charcoal, lighter, waiting, refilling propane, etc., etc.
and so much healthier for you than cooking over coals or gases.
I live in an apt building which does not allow gas or charcoal, so electric is my only option.The cooking quality is very good.
The heating is uniform throughout the entire surface.
Sometimes it blows off, but the idea is right.
I think a smaller one would work well.
Foods are healthier to eat when cooked on this grill, too...an added bonus!.
where the fire code says "no open flame permitted".
lets you use these since there is no open flame; otherwise, grilling is not permitted.
Chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs and steaks all came out great.
This is a great price for such a handy appliance.
So easy to clean and for those counting calories or carbs, it's a perfect way to get that lean protein into your daily diet.
So I began looking for electric BBQ grills and the George Foreman has got to be the best available.
I especially like the fully immersable grill plate and its nonstick coating.
The grill sits securely on its stand and the vented, domed lid is a handy feature.
Temperature probe is also well designed and easy to use.
What else can I say but, I love it!!.
The only word for this grill is awsome you can cook indoors or outdoors and everything is great and cleanup is a snap!!!.
No more flare up as with  my older gas grill.
I just wipe off the excess grease and put it in the dishwasher.
Oh, and I don't get splatter with grease when cooking.
I keep the lid on and I don't get greasy.
I don't have that barbeque smell on my clothes and hair when I use it either.
I got tired of my propane grills rusting out not working or partially working after a season or two.
This electric grill seemed like a simple solution, with enough space to grill several items, and it is.
None of this is difficult, but it's a bit of a hassle to bring it inside to soap it up and clean it.
However, that should keep it in good shape longer.
Ordered this grill so we could grill indoors during harsh Montana winters when outdoor grilling is impossible.
This grill performs!  Makes great steaks, chicken, hot dogs and whatever else you assign to it!  Performs just like a regular grill.
This grill will be used and used- a great find!.
Just put in the sink and it cleans up in a snap.
Have not had any problems with the stand.
Bought a cover and a hook for utinsels at Target.
It was a graduation present for my son and he is enjoying it so much.
Live in apts and we can't have open flame grills.
I purchased this item last year and took it on our trip to WDW for use on the lanai of our rented Vacation Home.
This grill works great!  It was easy to pack (we drove)and unpack.
We had hamburgers hot dogs steaks corn on the cob potatoes grilled veggies.
I dont see room for much improvement and love this grill just the way it is.
This is very handy since you can use it indoors or out.
We also find it is pretty easy to clean which we do after every use.
If this could have a longer less bulky chord; it would have a 5 star rating.
It's made well, cooks well and easy to use and clean.
I made perfect steaks, burgers and chicken before giving it to my son.
It's excellent for those days you don't want to hassle with charcoals or gas.
It holds up to the quality of George Foreman products.
I have always been a fan of the George Foreman grills.
It cooks your meat very well while draining fat as all other GF grills before it do.
Clean up is a breeze, granted you let it cool properly, and storage is simple too.
I haven't actually used this yet but I did plug it in to make sure it worked.
It was missing a part - the drip tray - and I had to call the 800 number to order one.
It took almost 2 weeks to get to me but DID get here.
Seems well built and I am looking forward to using it.
When I purchased mine it was $ 59.00 but Iv'e had it now for about 2 years...It is still working great.
I got this grill because most times, I can't be bothered to deal with charcoal and ashes.
I have a grounded outdoor outlet right in front of the door of my duplex apartment.
This evening, I did a steak and sliced red bell peppers and halved Campari tomatoes...oh heaven.
The residual heat and moisture helps loosen fats and blackened bits.
And no ashes!  I know I will be cooking outside a lot more this summer because of this grill.
I will have salmon more often because I won't have to fix it inside the apartment and stink up the place.
I'm sure my landlord is happy about me grilling without fire, too.
I bought one about 2 years ago and it's been amazing.
I love it so much that I'm going to be buying another just so when we have bigger get-togethers I have more room to grill.
It can get really hot for that nice sear.
We've tried corn, steaks, burgers, brats, kabobs, Italian sausages with peppers, etc.
I bought this because reviews were so good and I was not disappointed.
First use was pork chops and they were done quickly and had the grill marks too.
I have not had much luck with electric grills getting hot enough but at 1700 watts on high setting it gets the job done.
We needed something to replace our patio bistro grill,.
a propane unit, but in the winter time its so cold the propane tank doesn't want to work.
Easy to fix, i whipped up some Metal JB Weld stuff and dabbed it over the exposed areas, and let it dry.
The burner light will even light up telling you its on, but the plate wont heat up.
Take it out, unplug it and check to see if you accidentally pushed down one of the heating plate element prongs.
just get a screw driver and bend it back, its pretty flexible, once or twice.
Don't do it often or it will break.
it does disperse the heat fairly well though.
I did see complaints about not heating, and this is what causes it to occur.
I've become a big believer in the small appliance line-up from George Foreman.
I've owned at least four of these products and they've proven to be durable---and have delivered on their promises.
I've cooked all the usuals----hot dogs, burgers, sausages, vegetables---and last night, threw some St.
The big domed cover has the ability to hold all steam inside----or vent.
This is useful in cooking once you experiment and find the best ways of using it.
The grill was simple to assemble and it's also easy to disassemble for cleaning and emptying the pan that holds the drained fats.
It's large, but not heavy---so it's easy to move it to various locations, even keeping it fully assembled.
Also, it's stable enough that I don't fear that it will fall over.
In that regard, it's well designed-----lightweight but stable.
And again, that cooking surface is large enough for whole chickens----a turkey even!  Or you can put steaks or a roast on it.
And the dome is large enough to cover most foods without any contact.
The grill heats up very quickly and the heat settings are accurate.
Again, you have to cook on it a few times to find your preferences for different foods.
I will still use my Char-Broil outdoor gas grill for most Summer grilling because I want to be outside.
And I'll also use my charcoal grills on occasion, just for a change of pace and slightly different flavor for meats.
But this George Foreman Indoor-Outdoor grill has become a favorite for indoor grilling to keep some of the Summer magic alive in the Winter.
Owned one in Florida..love this outdoor grill!  It works great and is electric, as I won't use gas.
Even faster than a gas grill to heat up.
Good for when you are not allowed to use Charcoal or Propane.
So far, we've had burgers and fish prepared on the George Foreman grill and I love it!  Everything cooks quickly, evenly and tastes great.
I think I will be using this much more than I use the other two grills.
I think I will try bacon on it some Saturday morning.
This is a very versatile appliance that can be stored outside on the porch.
It might of took 10 mins.It is 31 1/2 inch's tall with out the lid on.
Plenty tall for me.The first time we used it.
I put on cut up veggies, with salmon.
(Veggies took longer then fish)Next day I grilled bacon , it also grilled even.
Although it is a greatalternetive if you cannot have a gas, or charcoal BBQ where you live.I did not get much smoke while cooking.
The handle you can turn it, so it makes a vent, orclose it.This is basicly made out of plastic.
If you keep the lid onit gets hot.We have a large stainless propane BBQ.
Before using it, I washed it, and I put this on high heat for about 15 mins to burn anything off.
I eat a strict Slow Card diet and this cooks up my meats and veggies just right.
I use it outdoors and the cleanup is even simple (just make sure it is cooled down).
The amount of food this holds is so convenient for getting all of my meals cooked all at once.
U can use it indoor/outdoor- No flames, so it's quite hard to actually burn the foodCons:- Doesn't cook the food 100% evenly.
Noticed that the area around the thermostat is hotter.
Not by much though, but you can notice the grill marks on the food stronger when near the thermostat- Doesn't get really really hot.
If you're trying to cook Brazilian style (large chunk of meat), it might not work out.
Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's not even throughout the whole plate.
I have just recently moved from a house to an apartment and the thought of not being able to grill really bummed me out.
I grill my veggies, meats and even fruits on it.
It is very easy to clean, very easy to use and heats quickly.
While nothing electric will give you the exact flavor of the great outdoors, this grill comes very, very close.
I went for about 1 year without one and finally gave in and bought another one.
I set it up right in the kitchen and use it for cooking all my brats, chicken, steaks etc.
without dealing with the weather outside or waiting for charcoal or realizing the gas one is out of propane.
I love that I can take it apart for easy clean up.
Even stuff that burns on there can be easily cleaned off.
This is by far one of my favorite purchases and one that I use the most often.
I RECEIVED THE GEORGE FORMAN COOKER ON TIME WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE.
THE UNIT CAME DOUBLE BOXED AND WAS PUT TOGETHER IN A VERY SHORT TIME.
THE COOKER CORD IS ABOUT 6 FEET LONG AND THE STAND IS GREAT.
THE DRIP TRAY IS GREAT AND EASY TO CLEAN ALONG WITH THE GRILL.
I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTHS.
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN GO WRONG BY PURCHASING THIS GRILL.
George really designed a neat grill for outdoor grilling.
I just recently purchased the G.Foreman grill and took it with us on our road trip in our motor home.
The grill did an excellent job with chicken, steaks, and bratwurst.
I followed the guidelines for cooking times listed in the operating manual and found the times to be right on.
The clean up is easy as the nonstick surface almost wipes clean with a dish cloth.
I was hesitant to try a Foreman grill as I had heard they could easily over cook the meat and were hard to clean.
The meat in each case was moist and done to perfection.
We will get a lot of use out of this appliance.
This grill has proved to be the perfect choice.
Not being able to use a gas grill on my lanai I decided  to try a George Forman and I couldn't be more pleased.
A very reasonable price for a well made product.
I don't need a new top but just in case I wanted to see if I could get one.Cheers!.
Purchased for use at fundraisers and this thing does a hefty job of cooking up dogs and burgers throughout the entire event.
This is great grill, like the other Foreman grills.
Plugs into outlet and you may cook indoor or out.
It is compact and light weight, making it easy to store in the garage as needed.
Cleanup is easy.I live in Florida and I wanted an easy way to cook outside so that I don't heat up the indoors so much.
We didn't seem to use our other one to often - total waste of time getting it moved out and back.
Got this one because you can use it either indoor or outdoor.
We haven't had any run off of grease (fat) so that hasn't become an issue yet.
Inside we put something under it on the counter so as not to damage the countertop or run off onto the floor.
This like all George Foreman grills is &#34;GREAT!&#34;.
Bought this grill earlier this spring & just now getting the good weather to use it.
This grill cooks evenly & is super easy to clean up.
I've even dumped frozen fries on one side & cooked the hot dogs on the other & they came out just gr8!.
I've used this grill for about a month now and cooked everything from meat to fish to veggies.
It gets quite hot, although it won't produce a sear.
Quite a good grill if you don't expect charcoal or gas type cooking.
I have a crush on George Forman and I am never going back to my gas or charcoal beaus.
I literally cook with this indoor grill everyday.
This is so awesome for the parent that comes home after 5pm and has to cook! I am hooked on this grill!!!.
This electric grill was very easy to assemble.
We used it a couple nights after we received it.
Can't wait to make even more items on it.
I bought this as an additional grill for the garage and for the winter when I cannot use my regular deck gas grill.
As for set up, I didn't even open the instructions and it took all of 4 minutes to set up.
The lid has an option, as you can see from the photo, to hook to the top when you need to turn your food.
I was pleasantly surprised on how evenly this heats, last night I cooked 2 fillets on it.
The temperature control allows you to set from low to high, with 5 levels to choose from, it heats up pretty quickly.
The top lid has an option to have closed or turn to open for air flow out if you desire.
My dad wanted a new grill, and he can't really do charcoal or gas where they live, so I ordered this.
It had good reviews (Thanks Amazonians!), and cost a bit less than similar grills I saw while browsing.
It cooks the food quickly and is super easy to clean.
so I told him a little white lie about how much it cost, they're living on a fixed income).
Best thing I've ever gotten!  It grills quickly and cleans easily!  It has a HUGE cooking area...LOVE IT!.
I ordered this from esalton because Amazon couldn't get this to me in a timely manner.
I usually only order from Amazon, so I felt like I was taking a chance.
But shipping from esalton was fast and free!  Great product.
I put this together in less than 5 minutes!  High quality.
It is raining today and I want to cook steaks.
Since this grill is light weight I picked it up and put it under the roof of my stairs.
easy to clean, lightweight and food is wonderful without all of the flames and having to buy propane.
I lined the drip tray with tin foil which you can move all of the grill scrapings into this slot for easy pick up later.
If a real gas grill is a 10, then this is a close 8 or 9.
Nothing wrong with its cooking time or performance at all.
My only complain is that cleaning it is a bit of a pain but thats to be expected with any indoor grill I would assume.
The size is ok but not as big as an outdoor grill obviously.
The con is a major one so I'll lead with it.
It's not as good as a gas or charcoal grill, hands down.
This is an ELECTRIC grill, and if you go into the purchase with that in mind, you won't be disappointed.
We live in a condo and grills are not permitted on our lanais (that's patios for you northerners), but this grill is A-OK to have.
So, we can cook tasty food fast, and enjoy cooking outdoors.
Other than that, it heats up quick, gives a decent char/grill stripes for an electric, and heats pretty evenly, at a pretty good price.
I haven't had any issues with the 2 I've owned.
If I could have a real grill I would, but if this one dies I'd repurchase in an instant.If I had.
I do like this George Foreman grill when I don't want to use my gas grill.
Even with the removeable plate, it can still be a hassle to clean.
Overall a great product! I would definitely recommend if you cannot have a gas grill!.

I had this on my deck mounted on the base that comes with it.
Used it out there all summer and brought it inside and have it on one of my countertops for the winter months.
I use this indoors all the time, for grilling anything you'd grill on an outdoor grill.
I use with with the lid (for things that need to cook longer like roasts) and with the cover off for steaks and chops.
This is my 3rd one in 10 yrs.
Nothing wrong with them, I just like to replace them every few years.
If you love grilled food and if, like me, you live in a high-rise apartment this grill may be the answer for you.
To be honest it can not produce the smoky flavors produced by a gas/charcoal grill.
It gets hot enough to sear and mark the meat.
The heat is distributed evenly over the whole surface.
The grill is a cast aluminum unit that encases the heating element.
The control unit plugs in, so the grill unit lifts off easily for cleaning.
One could set it on a heat-proof surface at a table if you wished.
The grill is large enough to accomodate food for a crowd.The grill includes a light but sturdy stand that lets you grill standing up.
The whole grill fits in a large sink.
Hot soapy water and a plastic-bristle dish brush gets off everything with one swipe.
As stated in other reviews this is a great little grill for small decks and works really well for the hotdogs, hamburgers, and steaks.
Love the clean up just pop the grill plate in the sink and by by mess.
We have replaced all of the older gas grills in our myriad of rental units and are and have been using this grill.
We have been using these for about four years.
Although I loved my Foreman, I wanted to see what was new in the electric grill spectrum.
After 5 hours of research, reading reviews, I could not find a grill comparable to this grill.
Based on reviews of other electrics, the main con was the time it took for the grill to heat up.
I would plug it in, turn it to high, and be ready to cook within 5 minutes.
I am grilling outdoors on a screened lanai (porch) and there is very little smoke, if any.
Medium rare steaks are done within 6 minutes, lean, boneless chicken in 5 minutes, and veggies are seared and cooked in 3 minutes.
Food tastes like it was grilled on a gas grill.
Putting the grill together takes 5 minutes if doing it alone.
Very easy to use with not much mess to clean up after a grill.
Have used the George Foreman grill for years.
Old one fell over in a storm and broke the lid.
I like the lid...food cooks quicker that way.
Line the grease catcher with foil for easier cleaning.
This grill is great! I was really surprised that I actually liked it.
You can cook a bunch of food on it at once.
It takes about 5 minutes to heat up to optimal cooking temperature via an adjustable knob.
I almost always turn mine up to max power.
The grill heats up evenly all the way around, which is nice.
The lid is kinda flimsy and dents easily.
I guess the ONLY drawback I can think of is finding a place to store it.
like almost everyone else i bought this because my apartment complex doesn't allow gas or charcoal grills.
if they did than i would have dropped alot more money on a gas grill and never would have tried this one.
all in all i got what i needed and for a great sale price of $70.
the grill surface is much larger than all the other forman's so it was a no brainer.
in no way is this grill meant to be a replacement for a quality gas/charcoal grill.
look at the price difference and understand that george forman grills, are what they are (cheaply made but efficient grills).
so if you can't use gas/charcoal where you live than this is a good purchase.
they would probably last longer and outperform this one.
weber is probably the top grill manufacturer in the the country.
This is the best grill ever! We eat outside almost nightly because this is do convenient.
Not anymore! We fondly refer to the grill as &#34;George&#34; - easy to clean, fast and easy to cook on, and durable.
nice looking grill, i have not used it yet but i am sure it will cook me some great bbq meals.
This is my second one of these, I ruined the first by leaving it out but don't plan to neglect this one.
I agree with the complaints about cleaning, wish the surface was smaller, hard to fit in my sink.
I got the cleaning pads this time and plan to use them.
I would definitely recommend this grill, bought one for family already.
Really wish he would come up with a cart that would surround it.
Very easy to put together and more importantly, comes apart just as quickly.
Just ordered our 2nd GF grill....My husband and I got this grill from my Mom when we moved into our condo about 8 years ago.
Thanks Mom! No, it's not charcoal or gas.
So don't expect it to cook like they do.
However, it gets nice and hot and it's super easy to clean! We decided to replace ours last year.
We put our old George out by the dumpster and our elderly neighbors snatched it up! LOL.
It still worked, but you couldn't see the red glow on the dial heat selector and the coating on the grill part was coming off.
The coating issue may be my fault for not always cleaning it right after cooking.
This didn't have them, so we always had to lift and drag it a bit to move it when we wanted to grill.
No big deal, but it would be nice to have wheels.
So we ended up getting the Char Broil Infrared Patio Bistro.
My friend who is also my neighbor has one and loves it.
I am a firm believer that you should cook meat the way it was meant to be cooked.
I gave it a few tries and we brought it back.
We could not find anything like our GF grill and ended up getting another one.
But it's a good thick lid and helps hold the heat well.
Plus, with a twist of the handle and you can vent the heat out if you need to.
Add wheels and a hinge for the lid and it would be the perfect grill for us condo dwellers where gas/charcoal isn't allowed.
But I still give it 5 stars because it does grill really well and it's easy to clean.
The first time I used the grill, it was 10 degrees below zero.
Thank you for this amazing product!  Vera DeLong.
Try bacon cooked on this!  Send your husband outside with bacon.
he's happy, the kitchen will not smell like bacon.
and you'll be eating the best bacon you ever have had.
(I do recommend this grill being used outside but it fits on any small or large porch/deck or whatever you have).
this grill is perfect for apartment balconies where you cant use gas/charcoal grills.
you will get the feel of grilling, but not necessarily the taste of grilling! but I guess for electric its good.
I threw my messy, hard to clean electric waffle iron in the trash.
This takes longer than your average plug in waffle maker, but it cooks them to perfection.
I would suggest heating up both sides WELL before adding the batter.
The instructions say to flip only once, but I ended up flipping it back and forth a couple of times.
It is a bit heavy, so be prepared for that.
I'm not sure how I would like making waffles for a crowd with this, but for one or two people, it's just fine.
I had to find a decent one to use on the stove top.
Luckily, I have.This one makes one thick Belgian waffle, about 8" square, which can be split into quarters.
Just before the first and between each waffle, I use a silicone brush to lightly coat the upper and lower plates.
With a batter jug, I pour the waffle mixture in and close the lid.
After 20 seconds or so, flip the iron over and cook until steaming stops and waffles are nicely browned.
Then, just tip it out onto a plate.
I had one overflow on me, and it was a bit messy.
Other than that one time, it's been smooth sailing all the way.
After this, I'm not sure I'd go back to an electric one again.
I have been trying to find a waffle maker for 220v and I had a hard time with out spending alot of money.
Also I have a small kitche and not a lot os counter space of storage for a huge waffle maker.
It fits with my pans and I can use it without worring about plugs and voltages.
Mine did not come with a recipe, like others talk about, but I found a recipe that I like.
We do waffles at my house about 2-3 times a month, this was a great buy.
Once you get the hang of it, this works super well.
Absolutely LOVE this waffle iron!  It is much lighter than I thought it would be but very sturdy.
I did this while making the waffle batter.
Then, pour the batter in and close the top and cook 1 minute on the first side and 2 minutes on the second.
The waffle just lifts right out with a fork...no sticking, no spraying necessary and I just rinsed with water for a quick cleanup.
The hinged lid will stay open by itself, allowing you to use both hands for the bowl and ladle for the batter.
All opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone.
This is the best waffler you can buy.
We have a gas cook top and it performs better than any other.
Our family has enjoyed years of great waffles off this device.
We especially like to add walnuts to the basic batter.
In fact, I am happy with all the Nordic Ware products I own...and they are all made right here in the USA.
Cleanup it pretty quick with a bottle brush to get in all the crevices.
I can't quite get it as crispy as the restaurant though.
Also, it's hit or miss figuring out the heat setting on the stove.
I use shortening and I brush it with a silicone brush in between waffles.
Also, before serving I toast the waffles in a toaster oven to give them a final zap of crispness.
We live out in the country & every year we have about 30 people out for several days.
More than once while using the waffle iron to fix breakfast for all, guests have said where did you get this?  I love it.
So this year (I already own 3)when my brother in law made the remark I ordered one for him.
If you own an electric model throw it out and get this!!!!!!!!!.
I had to throw away my last waffle iron since it was SO sticky and grimy I couldn't pack it when I moved.
Very happy that I bought this! (I make grain-free waffles with this and they turn out AWESOME!).
it makes perfect belgian waffles with deep pockets and is easy to clean up.
i definitely recommend spraying with cooking spray between each waffle so they don't stick.
It's very easy to clean and stores easily.
We put it in the dishwasher a couple of times by accident, but it was fine (the instructions say to hand wash it).
We only grease the waffle iron a bit, and the waffles release easily every time.
We have a gas stove, I am not sure how well this would work with an electric.
We wanted to make waffles at home, but we didn't want to buy another appliance.
This iron is easy to use and makes fluffy waffles in only a few minutes.
It's not like you can't find waffle recipes online, but there are a lot of good options printed on the packaging.
We're going to try the beer waffles next with some leftover pumpkin ale that no one wants to drink.Cons:-The handle is plastic.
I'm not expecting it to melt, but it feels cheap.
We haven't found that we needed it to get the iron to the right temperature.
My new favorite and I have vowed to use this every weekend for family breakfasts.
I have not tried another iron before so I cannot compare.
So even if the plastic comes off, there would be aluminum underneath.I wowed my family at the first use.
I just followed the Belgium Waffle recipe that came with the packaging.
If you don't have a recipe in mind, try that one first.
I recommend doubling the sugar as it only calls for 1 tablespoon.
And then experiment with how much batter to add.
If you watched the video on Amazon, they instruct that you add one cup of batter in the center of the pan.
And the batter is suppose do spread when you put the top piece down.
That is not what happened for me no matter how I tried.I warned the two sides of the iron on separate burners on med-low.
I put the top piece on and immediately flip.
This ensures an evenly toasted crunch on both sides.
You can check the browning as frequently as you want by slightly opening the iron while cooking.
You can easily peel it off when it's cooked.
You try to wipe it, you will smear it and the residue will be harder to clean off.
This pan works well on my ceramic glass stove top.
I heat the two sides on two different burners at almost medium heat.
I cover the batter with the other half of the pan and put the timer on for 1 minute.
I turn the pan over and heat the other side for another minute.
There were parts of the old electric waffler that had a permanent crust because I couldn't reach it easily to clean.
I have no cleaning issues with the Nordic ware pan.
It's storage footprint is so small!The key to the waffler is the heat.
On medium heat the pan works beautifully and the waffles come out how I like them - golden brown.
I had my doubts about this, I would have preferred a cast iron waffle maker, but the price was right so I bought it.
I use my own waffle recipes and one from Eating Well that is multigrain and very low fat, and it works every time.
I treat it much the way I do my cast iron pans.
I put it on high heat, let it get very hot, then turn to medium-high, spray with some oil, and go.
You can't be afraid of using your stove burner here.
got this at Target on clearance for less than amazon price.
used pam before the first one but I don't think it was necessary.
the waffles came out easily with a plastic fork.
i used just over a cup per waffle so the edges were a little round.
probably best to do the full 1 and 1/4 cup that the recipe calls for if you want the pretty square.
clean up was easy and i'm so happy to have a waffle maker that I can completely immerse in water.
i look forward to many more lazy, sunday morning waffles.
I use this weekly with the king Arthur Belgian waffle recipe.
The waffle iron came with recipes on its package.
I tried all of them plus multiple other recipes around the internet.
The Belgian waffle recipe on the package is my favorite one.
The waffles came out crisp on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.
I also love the slight yeasty taste.The waffle iron was solidly made.
It's a little heavy to lift with one hand.
But that only makes me enjoy the waffles more.
I don't clean it with soap after each use.
If it gets very dirty I just rinse it with warm water and let air dry.
The best thing is that it takes very little space to store.
Heated both sides, sprayed with pam, poured in premix pancake batter to fill the holes.
I will try buttermilk mix, if they sell it, and try mixing in more sugar.
Cleaned it in a dishwasher, so the nonstick coat may not last as long.
The iron is in two pieces so handling it takes a bit more observation than a frypan.
At first, I was hesitant about buying this waffle iron due to my electric stove top.
Be sure to grease both irons with a small amount of vegetable oil.
Don't use PAM as it can build up and corrode the irons.
Got this little gadget so my kids can make their own egg sandwiches in the morning.
The instructions say to scramble an egg or two in the plastic dish prior to nuking it.
Having a child do this will result in more egg on the counter than in the dish.2.
Throw on a piece of cheese and forget about the kids asking to go to McD's!.
I use it for cooking bacon in the microwave.
I got two of these bacon cookers so that I have one to use when the other is in the dishwasher.
When used with a recommended lid, its a very clean way to cook bacon in the microwave, I use it every day.
I spray a little mist of olive oil in the bottom or it's a bit hard to remove the egg and harder to clean.
I normally make bacon in a skillet, but this is what I use if I want fast bacon.
I cut Kirkland Signature bacon in half and this tray accommodates four strips.
In about four or five minutes, I have crisp, no fuss bacon.
This and the lid go in the dishwasher.
The bacon doesn't come out as awesome as the bacon in the skillet, but it's very close.
Not sure if I would buy this specific one again, as they make ones that are square and bigger to accommodate full slices of bacon.
If I try to put four slices of bacon on my round one, the edges hang off the sides.
when I first got this out of the box I thought, &#34;why on earth did I buy this&#34;.
I just cover the bacon with a paper towel and it works fine.
you have to test a bit with different thicknesses of bacon to see how long to cook it.
the pieces come out nice and flat so works well for bacon for sandwiches.
its actually not that bad to clean either.
there is a small spout on the side so you can pour excess grease out.
I use a brush, and the edges of the slats get cleaned out pretty quickly.
its quite sturdy also....not a rubbery plastic but very rigid.
No need to get a pan out and I can do two eggs in about 1 min.
Put it in the microwave for 1  minutes.
Oh, and as a bonus it's made in the USA.
The only thing that's not specified on here is whether or not it's BPA free.
It just says made from "food-safe plastic", which hopefully means BPA free, but I would prefer if it was specified.
Anyway, it's still a five star gadget in my opinion!.
This thing is great! Does eggs just the right size for English Muffins for breakfast sandwiches.
I love to have one piece of bacon every morning with breakfast.
Using this rack in the microwave with a half paper towel placed loosely over top makes the perfect no-stick slice.
Fat pours easily out of a corner of the pan into a container for throw away.
I like this product for catching spills under dishes that I warm in the microwave and also to cook bacon.
I love bacon in the microwave, it gets it very crispy the way I like it and it catches all the grease below.
I bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer, she is always complaining that her bowls get ruined because eggs stick.
The video says 45 seconds to 1 minute but it must be talking about only one egg.
Two eggs took 2 minutes in a 1000 watt microwave on high.
Even thou it did take two minutes It was still quicker and less to clean up when done.
It is made cheap and the hinges on the lid could be improved.
With care it should last long enough for me to feel I got my moneys worth.
I like the way this works, though I do wish it had a little more of a slant to it.
I prop it up a little, and it works better that way; however, that's the only thing I would change.
This works very well for bacon and sausage in the microwave.
I put a weight on top (as recommended by others to keep the lid on).
I have, however, added the half-cooked meat to the container after the eggs are done and then run for 30 seconds extra.
The eggs don't dry out and the sausage finishes cooking.
Perfecto!Have a toasted up an English muffin or hamburger bun ready, add a bit of steak sauce for flavor  :-).
Just put the sausage and egg on the bun and I'm good to go.I've already recommended to friends who are looking for the same thing.
This works but Not as great as I had hoped.
The bacon cooks in the microwave but does not have that nice freshly cooked texture and feel to it.
Also, I do not see how this is just a bacon rack.
Honestly you can cook bacon with jst about anything that is microwavable I think and get the same results.
I think it is called a bacon rack because of the raised areas and indented areas to keep the bacon from lying flat.
So I assume you could cook other meats on it as well.
Overall it suits it's purpose, is well made and the price is very cheap.
This is the second bacon tray I've purchased.
The only thing I don't like about this one is that the corners are hard to get clean (the corners in the collection tray).
Have used it for more than just eggs.
This is a convenient tool that is great when you're in a hurry.
The 4 star rating is due to difficulty in cleaning it.
I use it to cook entire packages of bacon one batch after another.
The more batches cooked, the more difficult cleaning becomes because the food becomes stuck to the tray.
I've run out thought the dishwasher after use and had to hand scrub much of the stuck on food off.
I use this quite a lot in my convection microwave.
The bacon side works well for (wait for it) bacon...but it is difficult to clean.
The flat side works well for most everything else...and then I can use it as a plate if I really felt like it.
It's dishwasher safe too, though our dishwasher doesn't get it as clean as I would have hoped.
Still worth the price, and I'll buy another one when mine finally dies.
My wife has been using this for about a month now to cook her store brand Egg Beater style eggs.
She used to cook the eggs in a pan but they always turned out flat, lifeless, and got cold quick.
With this microwave bowl, the eggs are cooked in about 1:15 and they come out hot, fluffy, and they taste amazing.
I have not tried it using a traditional egg but for liquid egg products this is amazing.
One recommendation would be to spray a LITTLE spray of non-stick spray in the pan to keep the eggs from sticking.
I don't use this as much as I thought I would because it is a little difficult to clean.
Good quality and it works, as long as your muffin isn't too large nor too small.
I was surprised at how sturdy it was.
Had this for many years and finally started to deteriorate.
Used it constantly and happy to be able to get the same one.
People who complain--use paper towels underneath and on top of bacon.
Not much mess and little grease on the bacon.
Also, use it for baking Idaho and sweet potatoes--no paper towels.
Don't know what you expect this item to do, especially for the price.
It's not that hard to cook an egg on the stove.
Spouse puts them in the trash can to drain off the grease; my only two got thrown away by mistake.
I'm ordering two new ones again; that's the best reference you can get.
This worked quite well and did exactly as promised.
I was amazed that a microwave could do it as well as it did.
My ancient Littonware gave up the ghost, so I went with this one mainly for its size.
It will only hold four strips of bacon, but that's enough for me and it should fit all sizes of microwaves.
One minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far.
Pre-spray with cooking spray and cleanup is a snap.
This is one of those inexpensive products that exceeds expectations.
We use it to make Egg-Beaters egg sandwiches.
We just pour the eggs into the pan and pop it into the microwave.
The size is perfect for creating an "egg patty" that fits a large english muffin or sandwich things.
Simple, well-designed, inexpensive product that performs very well.
This eggs 'n muffin pan cooks eggs to perfection.
I cook my eggs for one minute and 40 seconds.
It is real simple to use, is one thing I like about it.
I read the reviews for this item prior to purchasing it.
The several negative ones gave me some pause for consideration.
However, since most reviews were in the positive sense, I took the chance and purchased it.
I am glad I made the right decision.
I have cooked bacon and sausage on it and have not had any trouble cleaning it after each use as some other reviewers have mentioned.
The only caveat I would give to future purchasers of this item is that its size is a bit on the small side.
The plate will easily accommodate five Italian sausages.
I turn them over about halfway through their cooking.
I use a Progressive splatter shield and there is absolutely no mess to the microwave's interior surfaces.
This is an item well worth Amazon's purchase price.
You can make an aftermarket McMuffin in a pinch or mini omelettes.
This is a great product, gave it a 5 stars because it does everything it stated it would.
If it can go in the microwave and dishwasher that is great.
Especially in the summer months when it is hot out and you do not want to heat up your home.
Cleans up great and cooks your egg they way you want it for a nice sandwich.
I would recommend this product to my friends and family.
Purchased the whole kit for personal use and sent out another 4 for Christ's Mass Prezzies.
They all work 'just as advertised.' Just DON'T FORGET to pierce the egg yoke before putting same in the MicroWave.
Don't and you'll have one heck of a mess to clean up; other than that bit.
60-90 seconds after hitting the 'on button' you're serving breakfast.
FAT JUST ROLL OFF THE MEAT AND CAN BE DRAIN EASILY.
I mix 2 eggs, 1T Silk or sour cream, salt and pepper and nuke for 1.5 minutes in my 1200 watt microwave.
This would be great for younger kids learning how to make their own breakfast before school!.
I had my last tray for 15+ years and knew Amazon would have replacement.
OK, I just used this for the first time this morning.
My wife and I like to start our day with an egg and cheese sandwich on a loaded bagel.
We also have our own chickens so our eggs are fresh.
Shredded cheese on top and microwaved for one minute.
I think I'll get a few more of these for Christmas gifts.
So far this has lived up to it's intended purpose, grilling burger patties.
I have not tried it on anything else but feel that with a little experimenting it will be great for other food.
But it's definitely not as good as making it on the stove.
I can't put my finger on it, but something is off.
I won't cook an egg in this plain, I don't like the taste.
I don't think it's the plastic, I think it's the way it cooks (the speed and temp).
That being said, it's perfect for quick on the go.
It's not as good, but quick and easy, and little clean up.
This is so far my favorite item in the kitchen, I love eggs so this come handy for me.
My favorite is egg, natures seasons, portobello sliced mushrooms topped with shredded cheese on a toasted bun.
I had originally purchased and then returned the Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker.
I bought this so we wouldn't keep breaking our Corelle dinner plates.
We usually make our bacon in the microwave, it's a lot faster and easier.
I use paper towels with this, two on the bottom and one on top, just like I always do.
I like it but I don't think it does anything special.
It is very easy to clean, with the paper towels it hardly even gets greasy.
I will use it for a few months and update again.
I just got this and made only 3 sandwiches so far but am very pleased.
Easy to use, easy to clean and works like a charm.
for English muffin, it's a little larger in diameter than it could be but it's OK.
I use this almost daily to cook 2 eggs for my breakfast sandwich.
I use a little bit of cooking spray to make it nonstick.
One of these came with my Wolf convection microwave and I love it.
I also use it for baking small items such as frozen biscuits with the convection bake setting.
I have used it for cooking bacon and was happy with the results.
My wife fixes me a Canadian bacon & Egg muffin every morning for breakfast.
She formerly had to get out skillet, egg ring and spatula.
With this little jewel it takes 40 seconds in the microwave and only one dish and a fork to wash.
The bacon rack, though perhaps a bit small, work great.
My sister had one of these 20 years ago and it was, next to the microwave, probably her most used kitchen item.
It WILL discolor with use, though it seems akin to the seasoning that develops on an iron skillet rather than "dirt".
ie its harmless other than maybe it doesn't look so good.
It is "two sided" so you can use either the "ribbed" or the "smooth" side to do things besides bacon.
I ordered the setNordic Ware Microwave 6 Piece Essentials Cook Setand got other things grouped together.
if you don't you should consider a "spatter shield" to prevent messing up the microwave.
I've not tried the "draped" ones, but my sister owned the rectangular, sloped one and it worked fine too.
I have had the rectangular version of this, but it would get caught as the turntable in the microwave tries to turn it.
This round one fits just fine and the cooking is more even as it rotates with the turntable.And this saves on paper towels.
The top steams up so the moisture stays in the cookie.
I did not use any egg or oil in the mix.
I use to cook them in a Dixie paper bowl.
But they come out dry and often rather flat.
Cookies taste a lot better cooked in this little pan.
I doubt if cake mix or brownie mix would work in the microwave.
But the cookies seem to come out ok.
I even had my wife try the cookie to see if it was cooked all the way.
I only want to cook one at a time so I do not eat to much salt or sugar.
3 TB of mix is 140 mg of salt.
I am allowed 1,000 to 1,200 per day.
Otherwise it tastes like most eggs off the pan, bland.
I watched a you tube video on this first.
These are the greatest thing for cooking bacon - I put a paper towel down then strips of bacon then another paper towel.
The other side to reheat things but the grill side is great for even cooking with baked potato's etc.
I used to cook my eggs on a frying pan.
HA !!!! No More !!!! This little thing is perfect for me.
Crack 2 eggs, a teaspoon of milk, whip it a little bit,,,,,, lol Then cook on high for 1min 20 sec's.
I put my eggs on whole wheat bread with a slice of cheese.
1 star off because tray around side on grooved side is not deep enough to hold much grease when cooking fatty (bacon) foods.
Its great for warming up sandwiches, to warm pre-cooked chicken strips (schwans etc.) or chicken and warming pizza.
The grooves keep the steam from building up on bread/buns/dough of sandwiches/pizza.
If you are planning on warming foods that &#34;spit&#34;, look elsewhere.
If you want to cook bacon,(Nordic Ware Microwave Bacon Tray & Food Defroster by Nordic Ware) look at a deeper end for grease.
Amazon does offer one with a deep side pocket for grease.
i got this because of all the good revews...and it does  work i tkink so for what my needs are.
I decided too many eggs, so I'm not buying this anymore.
Love this little plastic marvel for the microwave - makes great egg sandwiches like McDonald's.
Only drawback - I paid too much for it at Amazon ($6.00??) and Wal-Mart has them for $3.54.
I bought two more of them at Wal-Mart.
We uses the reverse, pizza side to reheat frozen pizza turnovers.
We had better and faster results than with any other plate we had ever use.
I am a big fan of this product.
Yes, you have to have to clean it well or it will stain.
I find throwing it in the dishwasher every now and then helps with removing some of the staining.
Yes, it cooks bacon really well and removes the grease.
I have used this every morning and have cleaned it diligently for the past month since I bought my new one.
The egg cooker does exactly what it says it will.
spray a little oil in the pan, crack and egg or two, mix them up and into the microwave they go.
I was surprised how fluffy they came out.
No problem removing from pan...I paid about half this price at wallyworld.
It would be great for make ahead freezer cooked sandwiches to-go.
I bought 4 of these so I would always have one available during the week.
It is fast and easy and nothing sticks.
Watch the video for pointers it was very helpful.
It has cooked 100s of pounds of bacon strips and been through the dishwasher 3x a week.
It drains well from the spout into a cup.
Mine developed a crack and the plastic is blistering slightly so I am shopping for another one but I certainly got my moneys worth.
This is very handy indeed and works like a charm.
I'm not really sure what the problem was with Penmouse's cooker, but this one closes perfectly and leaves absolutely zero mess in the microwave.
Not only that, but the cookware itself cleans up very easily.
You could experiment yourself just to be sure.
I had no idea how easy this was.
Super fast, healthy and convenient way to make scrambled eggs.
I bought it because I wanted super fast way to make breakfast sandwich in the morning before going to work.
I highly recommend this product for these reasons.
This microwave egg'n muffin breakfast pan is very easy to use and cooks eggs wonderfully; it is also perfect for portion control.
I love this, I bought 2 of these.
stir & cook another 25 sec.No sticking, just rinse & done.Mary.
It turned out much crispier than using paper towels and is easy to clean.
I got this instead, and it works very well.
I like my bacon crispy and this even cooks it that way well (just leave it in the microwave a little longer).
It's pretty small, so it should fit in most microwaves.
Simple, easy, convenient way to get tasty bacon!.
Best of all it is Made in USA.
Found this to be well designed and made with quality.
It works exactly as I had hoped it would.
If you&#8217;re in the market I recommend you consider this item.
A specific need product but also use it as freeze and heat with smaller amounts.
the popping sound was a bit alarming - i'd forgotten about it- but the eggs are GOOD.
I have only used it once so far but I am fairly impressed.
Most of my tries cooking eggs in a microwave resulted in a rubbery mass that stuck to whatever I cooked them in.
I gave it 4 stars because I haven't had it long but if I continue to be this happy it probably should be 5.
Put a paper towel under the bacon before you use this and stain it beyond recovery.
I use it every moning to make my bacon.This is a quick clean up life saver.
Had one before and had to get another.
Much better than those other microwave bacon makers.
I wasn't sure about microwaving bacon until I tried this.
My mom has one and in 4 minutes we had 4 perfectly cooked bacon slices.
I sandwich them between paper towels - makes clean up easier.
I just wish it could handle more at once.
4 strips is about all that's &#34;safe&#34; so they don't stick together.
I used to use a Presto plug in grill to cook my egg for my own egg muffin sandwiches, several times a week.
I ordered this item on a whim, to make my order total enough to qualify for free super saver shipping.I absolutely love this little gadget.
I also like to add a slice of cheese after I put it on the muffin.
It is super convenient, the perfect size for a muffin and fast.
Clean up is so much easier than the grill that I used.
Wipe it out, or stick it on the top shelf of the dishwasher.
Also, I do not spray it with Pam before use, it is unnecessary, and only adds a few calories.
Love it, I am definitely going to check into other products made by this manufacturer.
This is a heavy-duty rack that can even stand up to a 400F oven according to the packaging.
It's quite dense and thick so it doesn't warp, and holds 5 or 6 slices of bacon.
Lifts right out with a fork, there's no egg stuck to the pan.
I'll immediately pour in more Egg Beaters to make a second patty (don't need to spray with Pam again), as easy as the first.
With a toasted english muffin, the egg patty this pan makes, a slice of Canadian bacon and American cheese, it makes a great breakfast sandwich.
We've been using it twice daily for 2 weeks now and it's working great.
I cooked my whole sausage egg and cheese on this all at once (precooked sausage patty) and all were hot and done just right.
Tried sausage on the ribbed side and even better.
I purchased this after a co-worker was using it.
I use it every time I am making McMuffins for breakfast.
If you follow the directions, it will do what it's supposed to do.
Look at the other reviews for helpful hints.
It's funny, but I've only used it once.
I promise that I'll use it again sometime.
The type of egg made with this pan seems a little &#34;wetter&#34; to me.
This is the perfect size to cook bacon in our RV microwave (which is fairly small).
Usually we bake our egg muffin eggs in a muffin top pan.
But you have to cook 6 at a time, which means storing extras in the frig.
or freezer.If you need only one egg and want it cooked fresh, then use this egg cooker.I cooked it as directed to try it out.
Also, spray or grease the inside before putting your egg in the cooker.
Placed the whole sandwich on a plate and microwaved it long enough to start melting the cheese, maybe 12 seconds or more.
Did you know that microwave popcorn can cause your microwave tray to break? Of course you did because you are smarter than I am.
However, this nifty invention has been successful in preventing a repeat incident at my house.
I have found it easy to clean and use.
This is the third one of these we've bought in the past 12 years.
Makes 4 or 5 strips at a time.
One minute per strip works out well in all microwaves we've used.
Bacon comes out crisp, flat and with very little grease.
Our cats have learned to pay close attention when they see these come out!.
Bought this to cook bacon in my new microwave.
It works as it is designed to do.
I like crispy bacon that is reasonably free of grease.
Get a cover for it , a splatter screen, or both.
This is the best thing I have ever used in the microwave.
A great way to have a healthy breakfast in just minutes.
I'm not putting a ribeye in the microwave!  High end price on this one, though.
I love this because my teenage son can fix his own egg muffin sandwich now.
It's easy, fast, no greasy necessary and cleans great.
I was skeptical that this would work and that I would use it more than the first try.
Knowing how eggs are hard to clean off of pans or silverware when cooked, I figured this would wind up being a lot of work.
My first couple of times I used spray cooking oil.
The egg slid out and there was very little clean up.
Again, the egg slid out and very little clean up....just a wipe with a wet paper towel.
It is fast and you can put into the sandwich what you want and also make it as healthy as you want.
I prefer knowing what I have put into the sandwich than going to MacDonalds and getting a chemical loaded sandwich.
Also I don't have to drive 15 miles into a town to get my egg sandwich.
I will be trying with egg beaters next time which will make even a healthier sandwich.
This is a great reliable product, especially for bacon but useful for other food as well.
Easy to clean, does a great job, will probably last forever.
Outstanding product, purchased several, perfect for morning egg muffin breakfeast using fresh organic ingredients verses fast food drive thru.
Quick, easy, and clean up is a snap.
It helps me make great bacon either soft or crispy.
The rack lines allow the bacon grease to drip away and also hold the bacon straight.I actually get straighter, flatter crispy bacon using this tray.
I can cook it at 100%, but the chance of burning it also increases big time, at least for me.
Add a bit of Hollandaise sauce and wallah, a fast great tasting breakfast.
It is very easy to use, store, and easy to clean.
Very good buy and very happy with it.
These things are awesome!!  I already had some orange silicone things that worked, but were messy.
These are so much easier, plus you can make eggs 2 different ways.
You can put 2 eggs in, scramble them, and it comes out just the right size for a muffin.
Or you can put one egg in, break the yolk, and you get a "fried" egg in the microwave.
Plus, they are much easier to clean than the silicone ones.
Only complaint----doesn't say they are dishwasher safe on the actual item, although I know it says they are on the product page.
Bacon is cooked crisp in 4 minutes with no mess, no smell, and easy cleanup.
I've cooked a couple dozen strips of turkey bacon (3 at a time) on this and have been happy with the results.
They recommend starting at 1 minute nuking for each strip of bacon (3 strips? Nuke 3 minutes) and adjust more or less from there.
The next time I cooked turkey bacon, I only nuked it for 2:45 minutes and it came out fine.
I finished the first package of turkey bacon and opened a new one of a different brand (Godshall's -- it was on sale).
The Godshall's apparently has thicker slices because 2:45 was not enough.
This is a great product that can make an Egg McMuffin in a heartbeat.
Usually little time is required to make a quick breakfast.
Clean up is simple too!  They can't make this any easier than it is!  Wonderful product for egg lovers!.
I got my first nordic ware in 1982 as a wedding gift.
We use this everytime we make bacon------I can't think of using anything else.
My original is still good, but the cover/splatter guard cracked and need to replace.
So I decide to also get a second grill.
I was hesitant about which one of these trays to try.
I cooked a frozen pizza on it & it turned out just as if I had put it in the oven for 10-minutes.
I was able to squeeze 6 slices of bacon on its surface & in about 6 minutes, it was ready.
When I cooked 4, it took 4.5 minutes.
A deciding factor for me was it is round.
pop 1 or 2 eggs in it, bit of milk, whip with fork and in 45 secs you got freshly cooked eggs for your sandwich.
you can spray a butter flavored pam non stick and it is so easy to get it out.
it wont stick anyways but the spray keeps what little bit that does from the egg foam during cooking.
great item cleans up easy, you can cook and wipe it out with paper towel.
Buy 3 and cook 3 at a time, just add a little more time for 3.
Once you learn what setting on your particular microwave to use you will get nice crisp bacon every time.
I pour the grease out into glass jar and simply wash the grill off and it's ready to go again.
Can fit five pieces on it at a time.
I used this to make two packages of bacon and could fit 4 slices, easily.
I had to use a small brush (after soaking in soapy hot water for 20 minutes).
The hints for toasting the bread if you are making a sandwich before cooking the egg is great.
I use vegetarian meat alternatives for the 'sausage' and I have a tasty, quick and good for me meal.
I did try to use the spray to help release the egg from the holder, but that was too messy for me.
I just put a bit on a paper towel and wipe it along the inner area.
It really helps clean up easy, if you use it every day.
Who knew such a simple thing can be so great.
I got mine at a local store, but if you can't find it there Amazon is the place to get it.
I also have a rectangular version,  purchased many moons ago.
It's at home all the time, flat side up, in my microwave to catch boil-overs or spills.
I never take it out except to clean it.
After frying bacon,  drain out any fat and place the rack into your sink.
Sprinkle it with dishWASHER detergent, fill it with your hottest tap water and let it soak for a few minutes.
By the time the water is cooled, the detergent will have done a good job.
Then you can finish it by scrubbing quickly with a stiff brush and rinse in plain water,  or put it into the diswasher.
Either way,  its fast & easy.I gave it only 4 stars because of its size/shape.
The rectangular reversible design is far superior to this one.
I was looking for some cooking gadgets and I came across this item.
Took a chance and I am a happy customer.
Granted the texture is not the same as pan fry them but as long as the family will eat them, that's all it matters.
Plus, it takes 1 minute to cook one egg.
A lot faster than heating up the oiled pan and cook it.
I love it! It is dish washer safe.
Dropped it couple of time and it didn't break either.
You can poach the egg but get this.
Just spray pam on the pan,crack the egg.
pour egg in pan cook for 40 seconds.
The toast the muffin add mayo on muffins.put cheese first then slide the fried egg add Canadian bacon or sausage patty on top.
You can make eggs or an omelet very quckly and they taste great.It was shipped quickly and I received it fast.Good Price.Thank you.
I would prefer being able to see how it looks before opening it hence the missing star.
I put in two unbroken eggs, some sweet butter, some tabasco, salt and pepper and half a slice of bread.
This is so perfect because its all in one gadget.
You can eat right out of it, rinse it out and pop it in the dishwasher or not.This is terrific.
This is not like getting a microwave breakfast to save time.
This is really good poached eggs and anything else you want.
I purchased this microwave bacon tray for our RV and when it arrived it was broken in 4 pieces.
bacon comes out crispy and fat drains down into the tray.
It is small enough that it rotates on the carousel in our teeny tiny microwave.
This works better than I thought it would.
It's perfect for my kids in the morning.
I am a huge fan of this product and looked in vain in stores, even specialty kitchen stores for this particular one.
My purchasing experience was excellent!!  And the bacon...spectacular!.
This does work great but it does get messy (but is it not always messy to cook bacon).
I like that all the fat is drained, just be careful when taking out of the microwave so you don't spill the liquid grease.
I have been cooking bacon in the microwave for years using a dinner plate and layers of paper towels.
It ended up in the dishwasher by mistake last week and it didn't really come clean after cooking up a few batches of bacon.
I still really like the product, though, and I'm glad I bought it.
It takes about one and one half minutes to cook two eggs.
Toast two bagels and you have a perfect egg sandwich.
I bought more to keep in our other houses.
In a few minutes you have a perfect addition to your English Muffin.
It is everything that it says it is.
This product does an excellant job on bacon.
I haven't tried it on sausages yet, but I have not doubts as to it's performance if it does as well as the bacon.
It eliminated the smell that lingered after pan frying.
That alone was a sheer pleasure, not to mention the no fat and the crispiness of the bacon.
It arrived on time and was well packaged.
I don't know why I waited so long to order it.
I bought this once I realized just how much our family was going out to breakfast on the weekends.
This little pan does everything you ask of it and more.
I use it to brown with but don't use the screen.
I like it but don't have use for screen.
The thing really works!  My best friend and I saw this popcorn popper at a local store for almost twice the price.
I checked Amazon's price and ordered one for each of us.
My friend adds a little oil when she uses it but I use no oil at all.
I was surprised that making popcorn this way tasted so good.
Low calorie, high fiber, great taste = perfect!  I would recommend using a higher grade of popcorn, though.
At first I used the cheapest brand I could find incase this was a disaster, but it was not as flavorful.
The cheap brand popped OK; but the nicer brand tasted much better (obviously).
I had to experiment with the times to get it right in my 12 year old microwave.
Works without butter but since I worship butter I had to add some to the popcorn before I cooked it.
Makes homemade popcorn pretty painless without having to buy the bagged stuff.
Like other reviewers, the Nordic Ware is my choice for low-fat snacking.
Easy to load and cover before pressing the start switch on our microwave.
Only problem is moisture inside on the lid; remove the bowl and lid right after popping to keep it crispy.
Sometimes, the I want zero oil air popped...which the kids enjoy watching.
Sometimes a want a zero fuss microwave bowl.
I put in a half-cup full of kernels.
I come back to a perfectly popped tub (that is hot, so use oven mitts and don't rest this on your lap).
I just eat them straight from the bowl.Clean up the bowl, I'm good to go.
This is way easier than cleaning a pot, shaking it, keeping the lid ajar to prevent steam from making my popcorn soggy.
And there's no secondary serving bowl to clean.
Seriously, get this, get the air popper and try them out...it makes a great snack, that much healthier.
Wife broke the first one but liked it well enough we had to get a second one.
We had an old air popper that was obnoxiously loud and it had to go.
We purchased this and I will never make popcorn outside of the microwave again.Kernels pop perfectly, no burning, hardly any dead kernels.
I'm not one to believe every "scare tactic," but I do believe there is something to the claim that microwave bagged popcorn is problematic.
Can also go on the top rack of the dishwasher.
I also researched electric poppers before buying this one, and I am SO GLAD I did -- so much easier and costs less.
I hate the artificial smell that bagged microwave popcorn spreads throughout the house.
used it for months until I got my stir crazy, don't think I will use it any more.
6 minuets in the stir crazy and i have good corn.this works but only if you want dry oil less pop corn.
In my 900 watt microwave, I use 4 tablespoons (1/4c) of white popcorn, 2min30sec and get perfect popcorn.
I bought this when I became aware that commercial microwave popcorn is unhealthful due to high heat the oil reaches, usually palm oil.
I highly recommend this product, and will probably buy several as gifts.
I eat a mini bag (or two) every day.
I forgot the directions at home, so I came back to this page hoping to find something - and BAM - it was there.
Add 1/2 C to the bowl and pop.
The product description says it takes "about 4 minutes" so I put it in for 3 1/2 minutes.
A half cup is actually too many kernels.
The bowl was so full of popcorn that the lid came right off, and it only took a little over 3 minutes to make.
I am a LITTLE bit addicted to kettle corn, so I decided to make my own.
I sprayed the popcorn with "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray, sea salt and a packet of Truvia.
Not to brag, but I am pretty pleased with myself right now! It's yummy!.
We put 1-2 Tbsp of coconut oil in bottom and about 1/3 cup of Orville R.
popcorn in for about 3-4 minutes in microwave.
How delicious! And aroma in the house a side benefit.
We each eat a bowl so I bought 2.
I just received my Nordicware popper, and popped my first batch of corn.
All you do is put the popcorn in and into the microwave it goes.
Pops the corn perfect everytime and then serves as a serving bowl too.
The instructions say you can use it for other things, but I haven't done that yet.
My air popper died awhile back so I was popping corn the "old fashioned" stovetop way.
It was not only more difficult but also time consuming.
I read the Amazon reviews of the various microwave popcorn makers and decided on this one.
There was another popper that was interesting but I couldn't see buying and replacing discs every few times I make popcorn (usually daily).
Overall it is super!  Great big fluffy kernels of corn.
Oh, and start with the 1/3 cup - I started with 1/2 and the lid almost came off the bowl.
OK, this is making me hungry so I best get back to popping!  Enjoy!.
I was tired of buying the packaged microwave popcorns as most were too salty or too buttery.
I looked on amazon and found this microwave bowl.
1/3 cup of popcorn, put on the lid and i set mine for just under two minutes and get perfect popcorn every time.
i immediately add some salt and it seems to stick well.
I was leary about this item but I love it.
It pops really well leaving very few kernels.
When I took it out, I tested it immediately with the simultaneously arrived Great Northern 15 lb.
The bowl was insanely hot!  Use a potholder or expect to be burned!  I burn myself daily on an iron, hot  water, the stove etc.
I was smart enough to keep my face away from the bowl when I lifted the lid though.
I hadn't put any oil, nothing but dry popcorn and it came out PERFECTLY.
The kernels were light and fluffy, I couldn't find but two unpopped kernels and it took less than four minutes.
I am incredulous at the quality of the popcorn and the ease of making it.
This is a great deal for a stocking stuffer too!.
After reading many of the other reviews, I decided to try this.
It makes popcorn that tastes wonderful and it is so easy to use.
I'm amazed that I never get any unpopped kernels, as I did with microwave bags.
It works great both ways, but without oil it is fluffier.
Another things I've noticed is that the kernels pop completely,so that I don't get the pieces that are hard to chew.
I simply pour in 1/3 cup of popcorn, put on the lid and cook it in my microwave for 3 1/2 minutes.
It is really easy to tell when to stop the microwave, because the sound of popping stops.
I let it sit for a minute or two in the microwave before removing it and a kernel pops here and there, as it cools.
When I don't hear anymore pops, it is ready.
I use mitts to remove it, but as others have mentioned, the top rim of the bowl stays cool.
Great product!  And it is nice not to have all those bags to throw away in the trash.
Also serves as a great serving bowl for the popcorn or other snacks.
I bought this for my husband because he loves popcorn but we don't want all the oil that comes in prepackaged popcorn.
This popper works great...it's almost too good to be true.
Sturdy, easy to use, and doubles as your popcorn bowl.
You get microwave crispiness without the oil and high cost of the microwave bags.
You really have to figure out the optimal popping time for your oven as the kernels will burn easily if popped too long.
In my microwave, the optimal setting is 2 1/2 minutes at 90% power.
The popper does get very hot at the bottom so be careful.
I own aWest Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper.
It does a good job but the results are a bit oily (the popcorn and what needs to be cleaned up afterward).
However, it tastes great, has a nicer texture, ans was included with the bowl.
Besides, I can always use the grocery store brands if I want to.The one thing that surprised me was how quiet this is.
The directions said keep going until you only hear one "pop" every second or two.
After using up the Fireworks Popcorn that came with the bowl we switched toPop Secret Jumbo Popping Corn,  30-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6).
I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.
I have tried various methods for producing popcorn but it never comes out as moist as microwave popcorn.
It's off-white-yellow-ish with random dark specs in it.
Two minutes in my microwave and I have a big bowl of popcorn.
The top is a soft plastic but has so far shown no signs of scorching.
I think those having burn problems are cooking too long/too high.
I like it a lot better than my previous contraption that used intensifying paper discs that burned and left a mess in the bowl.
Faster than stove top, greater choice in oil amount (as little as zero), and much healthier than bags.
As simple and straight forward as it looks.
I tried it without anything but the popcorn as well as with a table spoon of oil.
Thumbs up!!!(Slight warning on the plastic microwave bowl though.
I expected it to have cooled down a bit, but no.
it stays very hot for quite a long time).
Nice big popcorn popper does a good job if the kernels are fresh.
I add a small amount of olive oil and use the popper as a serving bowl.
I can make quick (and fairly quiet) popcorn without having to eat the 'stuff' they put on microwave popcorn.
The bowl works very well, although I was surprised that the lid doesn't exactly snap on, it sort of just fits and perches on top.
Not worth taking off a star, but you definitely have to pluck carefully when eating out of the bowl.
Also, I just don't like the way the smell lingers and I hate sticking my hand into the gross bag.
It's small enough that it doesn't take up much of my precious space.
I can buy whatever popcorn I want for it (I actually got some from the farmer's market).
I usually cook with a bit of olive oil, but it's fine without it.
I usually just add butter and salt, but you can add anything.
I still don't get it right half the time.
Luckily, though, you can just put it back in to get the leftover kernels to pop.
It did crack a bit and has several stains that haven't come off so far, but they don't affect how it works.
I'm used to air popping or cooking on the stove (and, of those options, I've had the best luck with stove-top).
Personally, I've used it to successfully cook pasta a few times (not an easy feat in a dorm room).
All in all, I consider it a good piece of equipment if you don't have regular access to a stove.
I don't know if I'd use it if I had a full kitchen, though.
This works great! I have used the air popper, packaged microwave popcorn and the old fashion way and I love this bowl.
This is the easiest and the corn turns out light and airy and low calorie and fills me up when I have the munchies.
After I dry pop, I just add my favorite oil like truffle oil, olive oil etc.
and add spices like oregano, cayenne, pepper, salt or parmigiano put in a bag or bowl and shake it.
I am looking forward to making a low calorie caramel popcorn soon.
When done, it's dishwasher safe.Check the ingredients in your other popcorn and that alone should convince you.
If it does not, read how much fat and calories are in it!  This is virtually calorie-free in comparison and a great healthy high-fiber snack.
I bought one of these popcorn poppers because I wanted to stop buying the microwave bags.
The popper works like a charm and makes great fluffy popcorn.
However, after about 5 months of using the popper, I noticed a large crack through the plastic--inside and out, all the way through.
The same directions to make the popcorn were always followed, so it may have been there was a flaw in this popper.
Since the popper is reasonably priced, I'm going to buy another popper and try it again.
(see update below).I contacted Nordic Ware directly about the crack.
The CSR was great and said I should complete a form and send a picture of the item.
I received the form by e-mail almost immediately following my phone call to Nordic Ware.
I completed the form per their request and also sent a picture of the cracked popper.UPDATE:  Nordic Ware customer service is exceptional.
I called them on a Monday, and received a NEW popper on Friday.
No cost for shipping or for the new popper.
So, if you have a problem with this popper, just call Nordic and follow their instructions.
My Nordic Ware popper is over 10 years old and works as good as the day I bought it.
My Sharp microwave has a "popcorn" setting which works perfectly with the Nordic Ware popper.
I use 1/2 cup popcorn, and enough canola or vegetable oil to cover.
I'm ordering a few more of these poppers to give as gifts.
Bundle it up with oil, seasoning salt, popcorn and a movie for a fun gift.
I really can't tell what the difference is with this thing .., its really just a big bowl with a lid if you ask me.
But , whatever makes you happy I guess.
The results were disappointing with many uncooked kernels even at 5 minutes cooking time, and many burned kernels.
Suspecting our old microwave was failing we replaced it with a Panasonic 1200 watt and tried again.
We were rewarded with excellent popcorn with only a very few uncooked, and no burned kernels in 3.6 minutes.
I recently started buying the bags of popcorn in the stores as a snack.
I was amazed that a 12 oz bag of popcorn was $6! I stopped eating the bagged micro corn and wanted something skinnier.
I tried the Presto air popper, but it shot popcorn all over and left a lot of unpopped kernels.
This bowl works great, the popcorn is more tender and not so many unpopped kernels.
I can now have a salty snack with my glass of wine without breaking the bank or diet.
I chose this bowl because I wanted to make healthy popcorn, but I didn't want another electric device taking up space in my kitchen.
It works fine and pops most of the kernels.
It stays hot for awhile, so I wouldn't recommend using it as a serving bowl.
Allows me to choose my popcorn and oil, and still have microwave convenience.
I've had two of these and have given them as gifts.
The only negative is that the cover eventually deforms and some of the kernels escape during popping.
You do have t be careful to pull it out as soon as popping slows or it will burn.
if you want low cal popcorn this works great.
although you can use it with oil I have not.
I do spray the popcorn with butter flavored cooking spray for taste and to make the salt stick.
This is a great item for popping popcorn in the microwave.
I used it the same way I've used plain paper bags to pop popcorn in the microwave and it works beautifully.
No burning or discolorization as other reviewers have mentioned.
As with any other form of microwave popping, you don't leave it while it's popping.
Wait until 5 seconds between popping sounds and stop the microwave to avoid burning.
I use about 1/4 cup popcorn and 1 Tablespoon extra virgin olive oil.
I don't know if this has any direct effect since I have not run a scientifically controlled experiment.
Also, my microwave is a medium size with turn table and 1100 watts.
Bought this for my mother as a gift.
For years she has bought microwave bags, and was sceptical when I mentioned this idea.
She says it's better because she has more control over the flavor and will save her money.
I think I'll be buying one soon to replace my aging hot air popper.
I use this almost daily!  Always make consistent, great popcorn.
I really like the fact that you need no oil and this item is dishwasher safe (top rack).
It makes a generous amounts of popcorn with little to no waste of kernels.
Also the bowl gets so hot you have to use a pot holder to take it out of Microwave.
But it pops nearly every kernel every time.
This product makes it so easy to make good popcorn.
You still must wash out the popper, but it is way easier than with a big metal pot.
Be careful not to burn the popcorn and discolor your popper.
Now I enjoy popcorn much more often because of the ease of popping it.
Thanks NordicWare...for caring enough to make this product right.
Highly recommended.I hope this was helpful to you.
If you have questions, please reply in the Comment section below...I would be glad to help.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________MY NEW BLOG: thegoodstuffreviews.blogspot.com.
I use a little olive oil, so the seasonings stick.
You can use salt and or "no salt", and or parm.
Once you figure out what works, it is so easy and so good.
This is the perfect shaped bowl for making and eating popcorn out of.
with oil you get more flavor and body to the popcorn.
i use less oil than suggested - just 1 tablespoon to a rounded full 1/3 cup of popcorn.
it takes 1 min and 45 seconds to cook the popcorn this way.
it took 3 minutes and 15 seconds to cook the popcorn without oil.
(my microwave is 1500 watts) The bowl cleans up easier if you first wipe it out with a paper towel and then wash it.
it does not get gummy from the oil like some other plastic bowls do.
be careful taking it out of the MW - it will be very hot.
enjoy this neat bowl and you will be eating more popcorn - that is at least healthier.
We're trying to cut back on oil and salt and its really hard to find no-salt microwave popcorn.
Now we use this popper instead and just leave out the salt and it tastes MUCH better than any popcorn bag I've tried.
Occasionally though, there will be a problem with an order and they simply do not have adequate customer support to resolve the issue.
10% of their lifetime reviews are negative and they seem satisfied with that number.
I bought this after returning the Presto Popper.
The Presto popper worked a little better, but requires special pads for each batch.
Pops delicious, fluffy popcorn with no oil or other additives.
I put 1/3 cup of plain popcorn (no oil) and after it is popped, add a little melted butter and salt and that is all.
This makes popcorn in its own attractive bowl and also cleans easily.
I noticed the description says it can be used to heat other food - interesting but have not tried that yet.
If you like popcorn, you will LOVE this popper!  I have already bought two more as gifts.
Been using this for the last week or so almost every day to make popcorn in various ways.
I've tried it with and without oil, and in amounts up to 1/2 cup of corn.
So far my favorite has been using 2 tbsp popping oil and 1/2 tsp of Flavacol with 1/2 cup corn.
Worked great, tasted as good as what comes out of my Whirley Pop stovetop popper.
I have purchased 2 of these NW popping bowls.I have used the first one for years.
My husband tried to reshape it to fit properly on the bowl, but with little success.
I was glad for the Q/A feature on Amazon as someone listed the Nordic Customer Service number to call regarding the lid.
It is 1/877-466-7342.Like many others, I have used quite a few varieties of popcorn poppers.
It is worth the price.At the time I purchased this, I would never have considered I could find it on Amazon.
But good for Amazon to make this available.
After reading all the other reviews on this product, I find I must go pop some corn now.
The rep told me the product was guaranteed even though I have had it a couple of years.
She said that they would replace the lid.
yeah!  BTW, Nordic has a new popcorn popper available that looks superior to this one.
It does cost more, but should be worth the extra bucks.
Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 CupAfter being disappointed by trying another popper, I decided to try this one.
My search is over!  It doesn't require pads or other disposable junk.
In my microwave, it takes about the same time as a bag of microwave popcorn.
You can choose whether to use it with oil or not.My first run was without oil.
I was left with around 25 unpopped kernels out of 1/3 cup of yellow popcorn.
No waste there, my parrot loves the unpopped ones!Note that for me, 1/3 cup of yellow popcorn filled the bowl.
I don't think I can do 1/2 cup of yellow popcorn.
I highly recommend the Nordic Ware Microwave Popcorn Popper.Update: Black popcorn worked well also.
I think I could have done 1/2 cup of it since they are smaller than yellow.
I have to say I really like this Nordic Ware Popcorn Popper.
You can make the popcorn however you like, even plain without any oil or butter.
I will usually throw some olive oil in it, it helps the seasoning stick to the popped corn.
If your not happy with your current popper, or just want to make your snacking a little healthier, this is a nice bowl to have.
It's easy to clean, and is dishwasher safe.
Convenient product that works perfectly! Easy to store and clean.
Love it and use it frequently at my house.
This popcorn popper is also the bowl, so less mess and less dishes to wash.
The bowl is a little hot to the touch when you first take it out of the microwave, but cools fast.
Use a towel to take it out and then sit it on your lap on the towel to eliminate that issue.
These should be used as only the roughest of guides.
If you're listening to the pops and thinking, "I think it's getting fairly near to the time I should stop soon," stop it NOW.
Stop it before you really think you should, and accept that you will have unpopped kernels.
The better quality and fresher your popcorn is the better the result, but you're not going to get 100%.
As soon as you notice any change from the sweetness, stop.
Certainly it's easier than hauling out a special popper or separate pot that needs constant attention on the stove.
Pops well without all the additives of prepackaged popcorn.
Even 5-10 seconds more would burn the cooked product, so no fix for the residue.
This popcorn popper couldn't be simpler to use.
That's it!  Clean-up is a breeze and think it's a good sturdy bowl that should last a long time.
It makes fantastic popcorn and I don't have to use any oil at all.
My first batch was good, but once I got the suggested addition, popcorn salt and a bit of butter, it was great.
I have used it a lot to and, unless I do not time it correctly, turns out well.
You also get to choose the quality of popcorn.
I use this popcorn popper every day, for multiple batches of popcorn.
It pops beautifully and the popcorn is crisp and perfect.
I highly recommend the Nordic Ware popper to everyone who wants to do microwave popcorn.
This is such a simple and effective container for making your own popcorn - so much less expensive and better for you than microwavable packets.
I bought this popper in April and have used it about once a week since then.
I use about 1/4 - 1/3 cup of corn and add a tiny bit of olive oil.
I tried Black Jewel corn and wasn't happy with it.
Now using Redenbacher's in a jar, and that is working great.
With as many good reviews as there are on this product, I expected it to work.
But I didn't expect it to work *perfectly*.
Better to pop raw and then toss with your seasonings, either in your popper or a transfer bowl.
We love this popcorn popper! What a wonderful and healthy alternative to microwave popcorn - - - and much better than an air popper.
Thinking about getting a second one! Highly recommend it!.
The only problem is having to wait for it to cool down for a second batch.
We started seeing a combination of unpopped kernels and burning, so I tried a little trick.
I put exactly one tablespoon of oil in the bottom and added exactly 1/3 cup of kernels.
THEN I took my finger and swirled the kernels to coat all of them and then spread them up the sides of the popper.
(for  a yummy low calorie choice, spray it with I Can't Believe it's Not Butter spray.).
I've owned this thing for three years now and it has served me well.
It yields 2 generous servings of delicious popcorn without giving off that sickening, chemical smell like the microwave popcorn bags do.
They are more fragile than I expected, so do be careful - they will crack or break if dropped on a hard surface.
:)  You need to experiment a little to find the best way to make your popcorn.
I add a little oil and a few spoonfuls and I am good to go.
He was a pro, and I'd always made popcorn that way.
Other reviewers convinced me that microwave popcorn may have a chance to be decent.
I only use Jiffy Pop or Orville Redenbacker - the Food Coop's organic popcorn doesn't pop nearly as well.
And I use only Rice Bran Oil (1 tablespoon), and only salt with real Popcorn Salt (much finer than regular salt, so it sticks better.
In the last two months I've had this, I haven't once made stove-top.
or less of old maids with each batch.
I am 71 yrs of age so have used a lot of different poppers in my lifetime.
By far this is the best and such easy clean up.
Wasn't expecting much from this popper considering the price but after using it, I was sold.
Followed the directions except I did put a small amount of popcorn oil in the bottom for some extra flavor.
Placed it in the microwave and in about 3:10 minutes it was done.
Popcorn wasn't super dry like the air popped corn poppers produce.
Added some salt and some butter seasoning of my own.
pays for itself after the first few uses.
Also you know that your popcorn is chemical/preservative/additive free, compared to the bagged stuff.
Very simple and a great way to make snacking healthier!.
Purchased from Amazon, and was damaged on arrival, so returned.Happened to be walking through Target, and found the same item for the same price.
I've been using this several times a week for the last 6 months, and it's been excellent.
Looks like it will last awhile, but even if it doesn't it's still cheaper (and much more healthy) than bagged microwave popcorn.
I have been looking for a microwave popper for some time.
This one fit the bill and works well.
No oil is needed, so I don't use any.
You do have to listen for the popping, though.
The popcorn feature on the microwave does not really work that well.
I've had two popcorn poppers through the years:- A stainless steel Stovetop Popcorn Popper.
And the only place I could find them was on Amazon for about $1 a piece including shipping.Enter the Nordic Ware.
It's just like a large bowl that looks really nice and has small heat sensors built into it.
Just grab a 1/3 cup of kernels, pour them in, and start your microwave.
Like the Presto, you need to stand nearby to listen as the popping slows down to 1-2 seconds between pops.
But there's no risk of burning any inserts because there aren't any.
I wanted an alternative to bagged popcorn, so I thought I'd try this one.
I love it! Its really easy to use, and makes great tasting popcorn.
This is great! I was not sure how it would work, but with it being by Nordic Ware I took a chance.
It is amazing! I've tried everything from paper bags or bowls that would melt.
It is so much better for you too this way.
I personally love popcorn made with a little coconut oil, but you don't have to add anything.
In a world filled with junk products this is a winner! Nordic Ware, thanks for another great quality product!.
This bowl is made of a plastic-like material that is extremely durable.
With the cover in place, it will indeed give you nice, fluffy popcorn out of the microwave, with no water/oil/etc.
I have to dock a star for the following reasons:1.
The edges can be very, very hot when coming out of the microwave.
Extending the handles a bit might have been a good idea.2.
You need to put a lot of popcorn in the bowl to get it to pop; I'd say at least a cup or more.
I purchased this item so that I could make homemade, fresh, healthy popcorn at home for my family.
It is very well constructed, washes easily, and I love that it also doubles as the serving bowl.
It is easy to store and is just wonderful.
It is one of the best investments I have made.
I love making homemade popcorn, it is so much healthier and cheaper.
My favorite is organic popping corn with a bit of coconut oil and sea salt.
I bought this popper at a local Target for slightly less than the listed price and slightly more than the current sale price ($8.04).
After using this for a while, I think 1/2 cup of kernels is far too much to use.
I find better results with 1/3 cup or even 1/4 cup.
I love popcorn and this makes microwaving it as easy as pie.
I have been using this almost nightly for over a month with no problems.
We used Cat Cattle popcorn found at TJ Maxx, along with  a blob of unrefined coconut oil and Hawaiian black flake salt.
I do advise using a pot holder to carry it to a heatsafe surface though :).
And we've had a lot of different types and brands.
Microwaving popcorn is so easy in this, and we make it just about every night (because I am addicted to it! haha).
But we felt it would be safer to just finally replace it, since this is not too expensive.
As far as we know, this is BPA free and safe to use.
We have dropped it and it never broke or chipped.
It is dishwasher safe, but we don't put it in the dishwasher every night, only occasionally.
and just rinse/wipe it out most of the time.
It says you can pop corn without oil, but we like the coconut oil flavor, so that's what we use.
popcorn kernels (we use either Bob's Red Mill white popcorn or Orville)2.
-- OR until corn popping seems to stop or slow down a lot.
Your microwave may require more or less time.
You have to find that &#34;sweet spot&#34; for your particular microwave.
I sprinkle with Flavacol & serve.This makes about 8 cups (enough for 2 people to each have a large bowl).Yummm!!!!.
This popper replaces the very same model that just plain wore out from use.
Easy to keep clean with a quick rinse and wipe dry.
This was one of 2 things my mom wanted for Christmas.
SHe LOVES it.The bulky air popper is packed away and she has more room on her counter.
The lid has vents in it, so you can't use it for storage, but you can use the bowl for mixing too.
I love this popcorn popper--I don't have to eat chemicals to enjoy microwave popcorn.
I purchased the Nordicware 60120 Microwave Popcorn Popper in early December from Amazon.
Makes popcorn easily with or without a touch of oil.
I add melted butter and lite salt after popping.
I use plain old corn kernels from the supermarket and they are fine.
Use a potholder when removing it from microwave.
The popper is HOT! No oil is needed.
Begin with the timer at less than 3 minutes and increase the time just a bit as needed so as not to burn the kernels.
I have cleared out the popped popcorn and re-cooked the unpopped kernels for about 2 1/2 minutes.
When you have the timing perfected there will be only a few uncooked kernels to deal with.
Don't crunch on them because they can break your teeth.
Follow all instructions for safety, and so on.
I have a granite-look version of this popper and have used it for years.
Although the very bottom has a brownish burnt look now, it still has its finish (even in the bottom).
I recently ordered this one, as my old one's lid is a bit warped through years of use.
Its bottom was already melted on the inside! Obviously Amazon had seen fit to send me someone's return.
Now I do not know if someone misused the popper and fried the thing or if popping the corn in a sane manner caused this.
This would be true for any plastic popper though.
This popper is supposed to use 1/3 cup of popcorn, so I can see 1/2 cup getting pretty burned.
Possibly cutting back the serving may help, depending on your brand of corn.
Easy to clean, much cheaper than bagged popcorn, and pops about the same percentage of the kernels as bagged popcorn.
I have had as much as 25% un-popped corn and as little as 5 - 10%.Overall though, I really like it.
There is nothing (if you're a popcorn lover) like fresh popped corn, without chemicals and real butter melted over it.
We use this ALL the time and it's been through the dishwasher MANY times and is still great.
You must work with your microwave to figure out the exact time for the designated amount of popcorn, but you won't disappointed.
I pop my popcorn, add a little grated cheese, and eat right out of the container.
Pops well with or without oil!!!  Have given it for gifts many times now.
Skip the microwave popcorn that has so many health risks.
I bought this and now buy organic kernels at our local Earth Fare store.
Convenient too, since any uneaten popcorn is stored in the bowl.
this is the second or third time that I have bought the Nordic Ware Microwave popcorn popper.
It works wonderfully, withstands many, many uses (even at high heat - oops on the burn factor), and is certainly dishwasher safe.
A while back, I used mine almost daily and was not kind to it burn-wise or cleaning-wise.
A staple in my household for years now.
You use the popper as your bowl, so only one dish to clean! Does a great job.
Add a little oil to the popper for a little extra flavor.
FIVE STARS!!  This is by far the best popper we've ever used.We've owned one of these popcorn poppers for YEARS.
My husband had diverticulitis, then later a heart attack, so we're very careful about what he eats.
We love this popcorn popper since we can control the ingredients vs bagged popcorn and use "normal" ingredients for a healthier snack.
Our "old" popper's lid finally warped after too many uses or too many times through the dishwasher but it was still usable.
Since it's older and I had already been contemplating buying my husband a new one, I gave her the "old" popper.
We use Kernal Hagenbauker's popcorn for a very tasty snack! ([...]).
Decades ago we had one of the original microwave popcorn poppers.
When we reluctantly "retired" it after years and years of use, we began a search for a replacement that has taken nearly 15 years.
We are extremely pleased with the NordicWare Microwave Popper.
It is convenient and results in nicely popped kernels.
Only drawback is that the bowl is very hot when first removed fromm the microwave so care must be taken not to get burned.
Wonderful popcorn popper and multi-use mixing bowl and micro cooker.
I've had these for years, and finally wore one out! One year I bought them for friends for gifts!.
I've used this popper almost daily since I've bought it.
It makes a great bowl of popcorn (O.K., I eat the whole bowl myself).
It's helping me to lose weight since it cuts down on the other junk food that I would be eating instead.
I do use a tablespoon of canola oil with the 1/2 of Orville Redenbacher popcorn.
I also use a cheese topping (no fat, 5 calories).
I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys popcorn.
The popcorn seems healthier (and tastes better than the popcorn in a bag).
Besides, I'm tired of those 100 calorie bags that are too small for a real popcorn lover.
This  Nordic Ware popcorn popper is totally worth the price.
Just be careful and not touch the bottom of the bowl.
I just dump my corn in a different bowl and enjoy.
You really can't go wrong with this popper.
Pops easily and produces a light and crispy result that we didn't get with the old hot air popper.
My wire and I have become popcorn freaks.
It gives your the option of using oil or not.
A little oil prevents it from being to dry for flavoring to stick.
It's quick about 2 1/2 to 3 minutes, and pops 1/2 cup of corn kernels.
I bought it to replace my old electric popper.
It leaves a lot of unpopped kernels, but pops the corn great.
I use coconut oil and get to have oil on my corn without guilt.
I use this two or three times per week.
popcorn popper when I saw this bowl so I thought I would take a chance on it.
I am not disappointed in the product at all.
I would recommend this popcorn popping bowl who is thinking about getting an air popper.
this was an impulse buy since reports were stating that microwave popcorn bags were bad.
Well made popcorn popper, made in the USA.
Best to stop when you hear POPS drop away to about one ever two-3 seconds.
You'll get better judging when to stop with a little experience.
Better to throw out a few unpopped kernels than a bowl of burned corn.
You can also use a little oil (I like olive oil) in the bottom of the bowl to pop the corn.
Bowl also makes a good serviing bowl for other purposes.
The Nordic Ware popper works OK, but doesn't have the capacity of one I had many years ago.
Unfortunately, that model is lost in the mists of time.
The Nordic Ware model is simple and sturdy and will probably last a long time, but I would love to have one with more capacity.
The popcorn popper bowl is "granite ware"(like their bacon rack) and serves well.
it heats up so be careful of your fingers when you take it out.
It will leave unpopped kernals, but this is more related to the age, humidity etc of the popcorn than the bowl.
I used to use a fair amount of "microwave popcorn" but it is probably not very healthy and is very expensive.
so who cares if a few don't pop!The top (made of the same material as the spattershield) simply sits in a groove and isn't fastened.
[I recommendMisto Gourmet Brushed Aluminum Olive Oil Sprayeras it gives a very fine mist and you can use as little as you like.
and add salt of course if you like.] It's GREAT for HEALTHY SNACKS.
This item is clearly the best microwave unit on the market I believe.
The bowl will discolor a bit over time, especially if you decide to pop in oil.
This is more akin to "seasoning" similar to a caste-iron skillet.
the set was basically the same total price.I'll add another point.
this is a GREAT kitchen bowl! I find myself using it often.
it is sturdy, holds a fair amount and POURS GREAT with NO DRIPS.
Followed the hidden instructions on the back of the cardboard label.1.
Put 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels into the bowl2.
Even without the lid, which I prompt lost, it works great.
I pop corn with putting a paper plate over it and use no oil whatsoever.
After it is done, I drizzle it with melted butter or even spray it with spray margarine.
A little salt and you have perfect popcorn.
Such a simple concept that I didn't think it was going to work!  Works beautifully.
I've used this to finish up some very old (think years) mongrel popcorn and for some new Redenbacher brand.
Both popped up quite well, with very few kernels left - no more than the other systems I've used.
Takes up a bit more space than I'd realized, but not so much when I have it propped on edge in a cupboard.
This one has lasted me at least 10 years.
Have had to adjust times for different microwaves.
Use oven mitts and serve out of another bowl to avoid getting burned.
Orville Redenbacher seems to give the fewest unpopped kernels.
Cheap popcorn seems to have the most unpopped kernels.
Best alternative to an air popper for when you can't use one.
This is certainly by runner up, backup, choice.
It coasts it as evenly as possible, something you can't achieve at all with air-popped.
The combination of the popper and oil worksgreat for us.
Plus it's less expensive.This saves so much money on popcorn.
Before it was an expensive and unhealthy occasional snack, now I can have it any time I want and adjust the flavor and calories.
Just received in the mail and have used it several times all already.
I would rate this as one of the best products ever producedIt is really an A1 rated product.
This popcorn popper was recommended to us by a chef friend.
She was right, it works great! We use it with a little oil.
The Nordic Ware Microwave Popcorn Popper in the 3-qt size is a wonderful little device.
It's very low-tech, so it's easy to use, and it works fast.
I've made popcorn in it both with and without oil, and either pops beautifully.
To make a full container of 4 cups, you place 1/4 C of raw popcorn in the popper bowl.
If I make it with oil, I drizzle 1/2 tsp.
of olive oil over the kernels, then stir them until they are coated with the oil.
This happened to us, and the popper wouldn't pop at all because air could get into the container.
Then I set the timer on the microwave to the regular time to pop the corn.
The lid straightened out immediately due to the combination of heat softening it just slightly and the pressure of the plate.
oil, 4 cups of popcorn is only 65 calories, and a mere 50 calories without the oil.
If you are craving something crunchy, and you want to avoid high-calorie chips, this really does the trick.
Better to have a few not popped than to have any of it burnt.
That was my first batch and think I have the "recipe".
Easy to use, easy to clean, fantastic results.
Great alternative to the bagged microwave popcorn, with all the chemicals!  It does get hot, though.
Be careful taking it out of the mocrowave.
Its the perfect size for popping 1/3 cup of corn.
This bowl does get hot - you can't just grab it out of the microwave without a towel or potholder.
Not only do I like the savings on buying a bag of corn versus the bagged variety, I like the space savings.
One small container for the corn versus storage for the large box with individual bags.
This works as well as my original one from years ago.
This new one is a bit thinner and lighter weight than the old one we didn't take with us in our last move.
But it is holding up well to repeated use and we are very pleased with this item.
It is easy to wash and I can't find any fault with it.
I like the fact that you can make popcorn with or without oil, and it comes out perfectly either way.
The best part is that every kernel popped.
The only drawback is that the bowl gets very hot, so you need to put the popcorn in another container.
I've had this for several years and absolutely love it.
I bought a large jug of kernels from a warehouse store and it seems like its bottomless.
There is nothing I don't like about this product.
Made in the USA was a big draw but it also works better than any popper I have had.
I am ordering more for presents! Make sure you have popcorn to try this out.
I had one of those Presto Microwave Poppers until the replacement heat concentrator cups became too difficult to find (before Amazon carried them).
My family loves popcorn, and this Nordic Ware Popper is terrific.
Be careful with your popping times, because all microwaves vary in cooking speed.
The next line states it is top rack dishwasher safe.
I bought this to replace my 15 year old identical popper.
I had chipped it by dropping it on the tile.
Otherwise- got 15 years of perfect popcorn for less than ten dollars!  Wow.Remember, popcorn is a whole grain.
It holds a decent amount of popcorn and is very easy to use.
I have tried it with grape seed oil, coconut oil, and no oil.
Until you learn how long it takes to pop your popcorn, stay right at the microwave.
It goes from perfect to slightly burned very quickly.
Most kernels are popped, but unless you want some burned pieces, you will have unpopped kernels.
Very well made, has held up great to 3 years of regular use.
I wash it by hand, since I don't have a dishwasher, so that may make a difference.
Has only some slight staining from my cheese powders and seasonings.
I use it with no oil, and it comes out great.
There really isn't much I can add to the rave reviews already here except that despite them I was surprised how well this worked.
I bought this to replace aWhirley-PopI just got tired of dealing with.
(It was a couple dollars less at the local Target so I got it there.)And it's perfect.Popcorn was done in under 3 minutes.
I could use theOilandflavorings.that I'd come to enjoy with the stove top popper.
And since it's a bowl, it's easy to store.
For years I've used the air poppers, my latest spits half the popcorn out unpopped, and what it does pop shoots out in every direction.
This popper was featured in &#34;Cool Tools: A Catalog of Possibilities&#34;.
I used 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of coconut oil in the bottom and dumped 1/3 cup of corn on top.
My microwave is 1000 watts and a set it for the full 5 minutes.
The popcorn was evenly &#34;Buttered&#34; and fluffy, I just added salt.
It does get hot so hold it my the top when you take it out of the microwave.
It is made right here in the Twin Cities area which I also like.
I must have tried 10 times using both oil and without oil.
I could never make it work, getting only a small quantity of kernels to pop and ending up with a burned mess.
I figured since my microwave was 20 years old and underpowered, that was the problem.
It's just 700 watts.I saw this and thought I'd give it a try.
If it didn't work, I figured I could use it as a large kitchen bowl or to heat stuff in the microwave.
The popped corn is nearly to the top of the bowl.
There is a small amount of unpopped kernels at the bottom every time but it's really minor.
This is what I did, and the finely ground salt melts better in the oil and coats the popped corn much better.
This is a fantastic product! It is very sturdy, and I like how the steam escapes through the slits in the lid.
I also can season with whatever toppings I like, and serve right out of the bowl that I put in the microwave.
So much joy for a product that is less than $10!.
I was looking for a microwave popper to use for my afternoon snack.
I wanted to get away from using the bags of popcorn, which are so expensive and not really healthy.
I can custom fit the amount to suit me.
Two minutes and I've got my afternoon snack.
I bought the snappy white popcorn and am very happy with it, too.
I have a Sharp Half-Pint microwave I bought in the early 1980s.
It works perfectly well so I have no reason to buy a new oven.
The bags are expensive and filled with less-than healthy ingredients so I've wanted to pop my own corn.
And I found it.The Nordic Ware Microwave Popcorn Popper is the perfect size for my oven.
The first batch I made, I used 1/3 cup popcorn with no oil and had very few unpopped kernels at the end.
Never particularly liked micro popcorn bags, never liked the taste.
So I had bulk popcorn but rarely made it because it involved time and stovetop cooking.
Is it perfect, no...but it's an $8 popper.
I find I have unpopped kernels and the bowl gets hot in spots.
Some of it may have to do with my individual microwave.
Popcorn is cheap, so I don't worry about the kernels.
When I try to time it myself I always burn it.
Love than I can add some olive oil and salt ahead, stir and don't have to worry about seasoning after.
I like that it's pretty enough to keep in the bowl for company.
I never put the bowl in the dishwasher even though it says you can.
Dishwashers have a way of ruining plastic in the end.
Throw those awful air poppers out and get one!  We have had ours for 5 months and use it every day.
My husband wants to get a second one.
He is afraid our one bowl will suffer a terrible fate some day like getting dropped by one of the kids and breaking.
The thought of not having a back up puts him in state of popcorn withdrawl just thinking about it.
This Nordic Ware microwave  popcorn popper is the best thing to use when you are trying to lose any weight.
It did what I needed it too do it is easy to use and I would suggest it to others also just great.
I'm so glad I went back to this method of popping corn.
Years ago when microwaving was new I had something like this and it worked well.
Then since newer is always better (hmmmm)I went to hot air.
Never really liked that, and had to find a space for it.
Then we moved onto popcorn bags we tossed into microwave.
Now in my old age I've evolved BACK TO BASICS.
Yes you have to watch and listen for when it's done.
I've burnt one time and it did discolor the bottom of the bowl.
I did really well buying kernels at WalMart.Name brand jar brand.
Spray popped corn with calorie free cooking spray just a little and shake on flavor so it adheres.
I've been telling friends about my new/old discovery.
Actually have suggested it to people at the grocery store when I see them in the popcorn aisle.
(that's just me..LOL).In this economy this is great way to go.
Needless to say a GREENER way of doing it.
Clean and easy way to make popcorn without all the fuss and mess.
I think the popcorn tastes better when making it this way.
I wanted to make my own herb spiced popcorn and decided to get back to popping my own popcorn.
After reading most microwave popcorn bags in the store you are horrified at the fat and salt content.
Other reviews mention the popper getting hot but this would be expected with the steam produced by the corn when it explodes.
You will need to use pot holder when you take it from the microwave.
My popcorn sensor works pretty well  on the microwave but you still need to carefully monitor when the corn stops.
Typically 3 minutes will pop your corn and be sure to measure exactly 1/3 cup of corn.
I just then wipe out the popper with a paper towel since there is minimal mess.
I like to use spray olive oil to make a light coat then toss the corn in a bag with spices.
My only suggestion to the manufacturer is that they make the lid a little more elegant.
Sometimes I add parmesean cheese, or a bit of olive oil, sometimes cinnamon and salt and splenda or sugar, what ever!It's a good deal!.
Bought this for dear husband who makes my popcorn.
He said he likes it because he doesn't have to get out any other dishes to serve it in or melt butter in.
Saves on mess and he just brings it to me in the popper bowl.
We had the Presto popper for many years; and, he would use it first, and then out came the big mixing bowl.
Then he melted butter in the microwave (splatters, of course) and another dirty dish.
Well, long story short--always a bit of a mess.
With the Nordic Ware 60120 that mess is gone.
I can live with a few kernels in the microwave.
Just have to be careful when handling it.
I put a newspaper or something in my lap to set it on.
I used to make popcorn in a West Bend Stir Crazy but it was big to lug out, oily and hard to clean.
I donated it to a thrift store and am so happy with this easy to use maker.
I put in olive oil and use Jolly Time white popcorn and it is so good.
I have a 1100 watt microwave and it takes about 2 minutes.
I highly recommend it and the price is great.
I could not believe that this popper works so well.
I have tried it both ways - with and without oil.
I like that I can take it when we travel and not to worry about it breaking.
A scoop of coconut oil and some Flavacol and it pops up fantastic.
This is the one to have hands down and its really a bargain.
Get one for yourself and one for a gift.
After hearing about all the questionable ingredients in microwave packaged popcorn we wanted to try a better way of making fresh popcorn.
You do have to check the correct time for your specific microwave --- our first batch burned.
We also had too many un-popped kernels, so we reduce the amount of popcorn to 1/4 cup and get better results.
And, yes, the container is HOT when you take it out of the microwave.
Don't set it in your lap! Just use common sense and you'll be happy with this popper.
and does a good job!  It also keeps the popcorn much  warmer.
I usually use an air popper but the mini popcorn kernels blow right out of that.
I had one of these for years and gave it away and had a hard time finding another.
It take some practice to not burn the popcorn but once you get it it's great.
I like being able to make popcorn with butter in one bowl.
The popcorn tastes roasted and, I guess, richer or heavier than airpoped.
I've used a hot air popper for many years before trying this Nordic Ware Microwave Popper.
The Nordic ware popper makes a much crispier batch of popcorn.
Although there are some unpopped kernals left, it's not a big deal.
Every other machine I have tried leaves some kernels unpopped as well.
I usually love Amazon shipping but there was a big fail here :( The bowl seems to work fine.
I do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn.
I was happy I could pop it without oil though.
This was a gift designed to replace a traditional air popper.
It succeeded in that there is no longer any messy butter tray and fewer 'old maids' left over.
If you are a real popcorn hound the rated 12 cups may seem light in quantity.
This is great!  I love that the popcorn comes out just like bagged microwave popcorn except that I get to control the ingredients and flavor.
I mostly use coconut oil in it now because of the health benefits of coconut.
You just stop the microwave when the pops slow or stop.I think everyone who loves microwave popcorn and health should have one of these.
So, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  Well, that was a hard decision because I really do love this.
Purchased this to go along with the black and Crimson Jewell Premium Popcorn.
It really works well, fast, and is really easy to clean up.
Had to return the first one as it arrived cracked but got the new one within a day or two.
I personally use oil in mine as I think popcorn that is air popped only tastes rather &#34;tasteless&#34;.
I bought my first one from Target and couldn't find it again and then found it here.
We pop popcorn very often and a lot of times I have one sitting in the dishwasher, so now I can rotate them.
Popcorn comes out tender and doesn't taste like dry cardboard and is still healthy for you with the olive oil.
This happened to mine and one my mom brought home from the store was already broken (probably dropped at the store).
But for 8.99 or so (at big box store) that problem is pretty minor.
This popcorn popper works great & it eliminates all those deadly chemicals in microwave bag popcorn.
A bonus is you get the season the popcorn any way you want instead of getting that fake butter garbage & loads too much salt.
I have been using microwave poppers like this for over 30 years.
After 30 years, I thought it would be a good idea to replace the one I had, even though there was nothing wrong with it.
I just thought that maybe repeated microwave usage might have done some break down of the plastic.
Anyway, the new one is as strong as the old one and I will continue to use it for 30+ years, I am sure.
I have been using my popcorn popper for about a week now.
As a sole user of the popper, it is a great size.
I can make as little as I want or 12 cups.
As a diabetic I am taking every effective measure to remain in control with diet and exercise.
After using my popcorn popper for less than a year I find that the lid doesn't fit after a time.
I have used it despite its misshapen condition, however, kernels escape the dish in the process of microwaving.
It would be great if a revised lid were fashioned.
I am now looking at a different popper on Amazon.
My husband and I gobble down the whole bowl in a heartbeat, even though it holds quite a bit.
one for me and one for him!  ;-)  Washes nicely in the dishwasher.
I like that we can add the seasonings as we like, and not have to eat the non-pronounce-able mystery ingredients in storebought microwave popcorn.
Great way to make you own popcorn! Love that you use a little bit of olive oil and then can have fresh popcorn.
Because we all know the pre bagged kind is the worst for you.
My family had given me an &#34;air popper&#34; for Father's day, but I hated it.
The hot air blew many of the popcorn kernels out of the container before they popped, so I stopped using that one.
Then I saw the Nordic Ware popcorn popper on Amazon and got it.
It';s so easy to use and so easy to clean that you'll never use anything else again.
And I like the fact that I don't have to swallow all the chemicals in the store-bought bags of popcorn that go in the microwave.
Anyway, but this one if you like popcorn.
(Ok, so microwaving isn't quite back to the basics, but it's close enough for me.) ;-)To pop my old corn I used 1/3 c.
It doesn't have as strong a flavor as Orville's Salt & Pepper micro popcorn, but then I didn't add "Natural" flavoring.
(It's easy to try different flavors when you are using old corn.)I did buy a NEW Nordic popper.
It's sort of yellowish with a white lid.
(My old popper is white with a turquoise lid.
Except for the color they look exactly the same.
Can't wait to try it.UPDATE 9/11/12: Got new Jolly Time popcorn today.
I think that 1/3 CUP is too much to cook at one time.
Some of the kernels looked like they were close to burning.
Popping time was about 2-3 MINUTES for 1/3 cup.
(I wonder if popping time is different for DIFFERENT BRANDS and WHITE or YELLOW CORN.
I popped WHITE POPCORN this time.)Great SCIENCE PROJECT for school.
2-7-13 -- The Nordic microwave popper is a great improvement for me over the hot air popper that shot corn all over the kitchen.
I use it in a Whirlpool 750 watt microwave.
The red bowl is very attractive and useful for other food.
It's also eligible for Amazon Prime, with free two-day shipping which saves both money and time.
It makes a generous full bowl out of just 1/3 of a cup of popcorn kernels, without needing any oil.
We'll often put a tablespoonful (or so) of olive oil in the bottom prior to popping, but it isn't necessary.
The popcorn comes out just right, crisp, airy, with just the right amount of crunch.
I have not had any burning of the corn.
The unit gets a little hot, but not bad, and that helps to keep the popcorn warm.
We've stopped using out pre-packaged microwave popcorn as this unit makes it better.
This popcorn maker pops almost all the kernels.
It also pops the inexpensive popcorn very well.
You can use it with or without butter.
It only takes about four minutes to finish popping.
It is also good as a mixing bowl.
I bought numerous of these for my friends and family.
The Amazon price is great and you cannot find these in stores.
It was also shipped with Amazon's lightening speed.
I liked this popcorn maker so much I bought five more for my friends and family.
Good value and a perfect size to pop corn for our yard birds.
I hope many others will help the birds by providing them with this treat.
We put out a little each day...and always keep their water bowl filled.
easy to use, easy to clean, can pop as much or as little as you want and it never burns the popcorn.
Great for kids if you want to minimize the artificial crap they put in all the bagged microwave popcorn.
Great way to have pop corn without all the fat or worse the dreaded chemicals in the packaged stuff.
You can add anything you want to it - its a must have for any popcorn lover.
You can make as much or as little as you like.
I eat so much popcorn now and I get to do it with as little fat and as much flavor as I want.
If you eat potato chips or some other snack, get popcorn: save money, eat better, have all the flavor.
My fiance never eats popcorn but when I got this bowl, he suddenly became a fan.
We use it 3-4 times a week and mostly, we don't even flavor the popcorn.
It tastes fine the way it comes out.
You can buy a whole bag of kernels at Wal-Markt for $1.48 so, that's deal too!.
I had a counter-top popper for years and spent too much time chasing the errant kernels that spilled out.
You have to figure out how long to cook it, though.
I tried 3 1/2 minute but it burned the popcorn.
This medium size melmac bowl with cover allows you to pop corn in the microwave, with or without oil.
It can also be used to microwave other goods.
Certain types of popcorn, which can be purchased online, have fewer hulls and higher antioxidants, so this works out great.
The first one lasted 6 years and two of that had chips out of the bottom lip but kept popping.
Much healthier than buying &#34;microwaveable&#34; bags and much cheaper than an electric popper.
Not especially great but not bad either! All the kernels were cooked to a degree where all were able to be eaten.
Believe it when they say listen to the popping sounds.
Be ready to stop the microwave and pull it out as soon as it slows way down.
It will go from cooking to burning in 20-30 sec.
I'd double the recipe after the first run if you like to eat a lot of popcorn at one time.
I use this as well as my electric one.
It would be difficult to say which one is better.12/05/2012After further use I've changed my rating from a 3 star to a 4 star.
I was flawed in my use of it! I suggest you don't put any oil or other ingredients in the bottom with your popcorn.
Even the uncooked kernels(very few) can be chewed gently and enjoyed.
Clean up is simple and quick ! Oh, and don't double the recipe! Apparently my design went wrong!!.
We bought this about 6 months ago as we were tired of buying the concentrator cups for the Orville R.
A month or so ago our microwave gave up the ghost, so we replace it with a 1100 watt G.E.
Just for kicks we gave the Nordic another try, and got better, but not great results.
I then dumped the water and added the corn, and gave it a pop session of a little more than 2 minutes.
The first kernel popped a lot faster, and after 2 minutes very few unpopped kernels were left.
I don't know if this will work for everyone, but with our oven, it gives pretty decent results.
BTW, the Nordic's a very good general purpose microwave container.
It holds a generous amount of veggies for quick cooking prior to adding to soups, stews, etc.
A great way to get tasty fiber in the diet without any oil.
This Popper works great and doesn't even need to be washed provided the popped corn is  put in another bowl.
Because of the rim around the bottom another bowl is more comfortable while perched on my stomach.
As others have stated, this little gem works.
Perhaps I shouldn't call it &#34;little&#34; though, it is rather big but I can store smaller items inside of it in the cabinet.
I am by no standards a particularly healthy eater.
However, after reading numerous news items about the bad stuff in microwave popcorn, I decided to look for an alternative.
Yes, I own an oil popper and it makes outstanding popcorn--but it also requires a good deal of cleanup.
I recently received mine and have used it two times already.
I am very impressed with the popcorn it produces.
I still think the popcorn from my oil popper is the best, but the popcorn from this bowl is a strong second.
I followed the included directions and used about 1.5 tablespoons of oil and 1/3 cup of kernels.
It takes about 3 minutes for me to make the popcorn in my microwave (which I believe is 900 watts).
I believe they are also top-rack dishwasher safe, but, as I do not own a dishwasher, I cannot say how they hold up.
Overall, this is a useful, well-designed gadget and I have no complaints whatsoever.
Note that buying bulk popcorn and popping it is also much cheaper than purchasing the bagged stuff.
Update: I find that I have the fewest unpopped kernels when I use peanut oil.
i was torn between buying an air popper and this item,i just LOVE this item.
For the most part this works very well.
I replaced my microwave and it does the same thing.
It's always on the same side, so I wonder if it's just a flaw in mine.I pop the corn dry without any oil inside.
It works great almost every time, and it's worth it.
After reading about all the chemicals in the prepackaged microwave popcorn, I wanted a healthier option but didn't want to buy a machine.
We can make healthy popcorn in the microwave any flavor we want and it's easy to use and clean.
I like this product and would buy again.
I use between 1/4 and 1/3 cup of corn, and it cooks in about 2 minutes 20 seconds in my microwave.
If you use too much, or too little, it doesn't pop as well, and tends to burn, but just over 1/4 C.
After using it about a week, I stopped burning the kernels.
Just don't leave it in too long, and expect some unpopped kernels.
My good cholesterol is great thanks to this and other habits (extra virgin olive oil helps to raise your hdl).
If you use the best popcorn and oil, tremendous results.NOTE: I bought and used Great Northern Popcorn All-in-one portioned packs.
A) by the time the popcorn was done, many were burned.
B) the quality of oil and seasoning are questionable.
I think this is the third time I've ordered this item.
Works well for Popcorn and that's what I bought it for.
I suppose I could use it for something else in the MW but I am not going to mix flavors with my popcorn.
I love this popper, I already have one that I received as a gift and bought this one for a gift.
Great popper, I do use a small amount of oil.
Pops all the kernels and the popcorn is light and fluffy.
The bowl gets hot so be sure to remove by holding the rim.
It's kind of a pinky off- red, not true red, but I'm very satisfied nonetheless.
I really like this product and the ease of popping corn.
Cannot give 5 stars because after second use it has developed cracks.
For warranty you have to pay shipping to return &#34;for evaluation&#34; and if they agree they will make &#34;pro-rata adjustment&#34;.
This type warranty doesn't seem to me to be of any value.
Actually wish I had bought from brick and mortar business so I could return it to the store for an exchange.
I bought this Microwave Popcorn Popper over 4 years ago and certainly got my money's worth.
I've used it often and have had delicious popcorn each time.
They asked for further details and then said they would send me a free replacement.
A friend who manages a kitchenware store said this is typical of the high quality customer service Nordic Ware always provides.
She said Nordic Ware always has excellent products which they stand behind 100%.
I'm returning the ($39) Greater Northern Popcorn Original Stainless Steel Stove Top popper that I bought from Amazon last week.
Its much easier to use and most important.
Easier to clean!I made my second batch of popcorn tonight with this Nordic Ware bowl.
The first batch had a lot of old maids.
This batch only had about six unpopped kernels.
My Panasonic 1300 watt unit took 2.30 minutes with 1/3 cup of corn, 4 Tbsp of Coconut oil and 1 Tsp of Flavacol seasoning.
In the first batch, I did not use any coconut oil or seasoning.
About a 8/9 on a 1-10 scale.Not as good as my favorite bag of microwave Orville Redenbacher's Movie Theater Butter.
pops almost all the kernels, unlike my old air popper, and much much less messy.
and the pop corn definitely tastes better- it's more tender, i think.
I ordered this popcorn popper to reduce the unnecessary ingredients in premade microwave popcorn bags.
It is easy to use and to clean and makes a great popcorn.
By far the most effective popcorn popping solution we have employed, and here's why.1.
Lightweight and easy to store, toprack diswasher safe.(I handwash mostly)2.
(Ours is many years old, cost under 10 dollars)3.
We use popcorn salt which is finer and adheres better than table salt.
The container doubles as serving bowl, and can also warm and serve dips and queso for example.
Be aware the bottom will be hot upon oven removal due to imbedded material that superheats and improves popping effeciency.
By the way, our original popper was made by anchor hocking, but this is identical, and they make great gifts too.
They say that packaged "microwave" popcorn picks up toxic chemicals from the bag then there's the unknown stuff they add to the bags for flavor.
it has not burned the popcorn even once.
It pops with no oil or butter, but you can use oil or butter if you choose to.
I prefer to add olive oil, butter or coconut oil for flavor.
or add olive oil with some chili powder and salt.
Good product, saves money from buying microwave popcorn bags.
Cooks healthy since there is no oil us for this.
Did a little research and decided to try this.
Its simple and very effective!  Cleanup is basically nothing.
It takes about 5 - 10 minutes for the bowl to cool down.
So maybe buy 2 of them and problem solved.
A lot has been said about this popper and vastly good positive reviews.
I agree.What I like best is that it gives me control of my popcorn with microwave convenience.
I do have another popper it's a Roosevelt Popper that I bought on Amazon about 3 years ago.
Bit pricey and a real pain to clean.
So guess which one I use?There was a Dr.
Oz show that talked about the health benefits of coconut oil.
You can search his web site for details.
The Paragon coconut popping oil works well and only has 2 ingredients, coconut oil and beta carotene.
Either way, I'm in charge of the taste and the health benefits.My choice is for less salt than the standard microwave packets.
The less salt versions have had potassium chloride which leave an aftertaste.
I've tried some popcorn seasonings sold on Amazon and really enjoy them.
The jars are put into a dark cabinet for storage leaving a more manageable 2# or so for immediate use.
Each 12.5# bag makes about 100 bowls of popcorn.
The pricing on Amazon is very good and matches the warehouse and "mart" prices (which are 50 miles away for me).
I bought plain corn kernels in a bag.
Added one tablespoon of canola oil to the bottom of the bowl.
Shut it off when the popping sounds became less frequent at a little over three minutes.
Most kernels popped, none burned.The instructions are easy to follow.
I bought this because I was a little disgusted by the microwavable popcorn bags you buy at the store.
I figured I would give it a try.
I was extremely pleased by the way this popped the kernels.
I used Orville Redenbacher kernels available at my local supermarket and voila! Perfect popcorn.Set your microwave for five minutes.
Keep your eye on it and wait until there is very little popping and you're done.I recommend 1/4 - 1/3 cup of kernels.
Add margarine, oil, salt or just have it plain.Great product.
this is the easiest, quickest, no-mess way to pop corn.
i priced microwave popping bowls in stores and this is just above all i have seen, even though the price is similar.
i was impressed as soon as i opened the package on delivery.
the bowl is made quite sturdy-not like that easily bendable plastic bowls we are all so familiar with-like most food storage bowls.
i pop corn in under 3 minutes with this.
the top outer lip of the bowl stays cool to the touch as does the bottom outer edge.
caution:  the outside bottom center stays very hot for quite a while (stands to reason-it is where the heat is focused).
i dry-pop and while i see it is not suggested, i re-pop corn with no trouble.
i opted for the red bowl and it has a smart, almost sheen look to it.
i think this sturdy popper will last a long time.
another thing i like-it is made in the USA.
This is one of the best purchases I've made this year! It makes perfect, delicious popcorn without any butter, oil, or salt.
None of the weird preservatives or chemicals that are in prepackaged microwave popcorn and it's just as easy to use! Great snack!.
((I am not sure why there is so much debate on popping corn in a microwave popper on other reviews)).
I make popped corn 1-2 times a week.
No complaints.I would refrain using oil in the popper while in the microwave --over time hot oil and plastic do not mix--eventually there is damage.
I had a plastic microwave popper and used it for ten years and gave it away to someone as my new microwave was too small.
There was no damage after a decade but then again I used no oil.
I wanted to eat &#34;cleaner&#34; Yes, guilty of turning into a Foodie! I had one that DID CRack at the edges.
I do not use any oil during popping so not sure why there is a discernible yellowish ring in the bottom.
This would not stop me from buying another or recommending though.
I love the shape too.***Gentle Readers and Responders in the Review section, Please remember that Reviews are for the Product, first and foremost.

The popper works great with or without oil.
Make sure to transfer the popcorn into a different bowl for eating because this one gets very hot on the bottom.
Used it for fruit salad or something once (just as a bowl) and the inside stained.
I forget what it was exactly, nothing harsh and I didnt microwave it w/ anything but popcorn.
Still fine to use, just all psychadelic and tie-dye inside now.
However, I am trying to cut back on salt and I don't like the chemicals that they add to the microwave popcorn bags.
This popcorn popper makes acceptable popcorn and lets you control how much salt or other flavoring you want to add.
I like the fact that this one does not require any extra disposable disks to work correctly.
I should also note, that in a pinch, I have also used this popcorn popper as a bowl (although I didn't use it for cooking).
I like this popcorn popper it is quick and easy.
You can pop without oil which is great for those of us watching our waistlines.
It cleans up easily and is not a problem to store.
You can use whatever type of kernels you prefer without the additives included in bagged microwave pop corn.
This is my second one since the lid for my first was misplaced.
We eat a lot of popcorn in our household, and we use ours several times a week.
It is convenient and much healthier (as well as more economical) than bagged microwave popcorn.
We follow the directions and haven't had any problems with it at all.
I bought this popper (12 cup) for my daughter to usein her microwave.
Probably could use any container of similar style, but this does the job.
I've probably used it even longer than that.
I actually own 2 of them, and both of them work fine.
I haven't had any problems with the lid being mishapen, probably because I don't use my dryer element in my dishwasher.
I turn that off, and my dishes are virtually dry when I take them out anyway, because of the hot water.
It's delicious!  I also do this when cooking on top of the stove.
It's hard to resist the slightly sweet taste.
Add butter to that and I'm in heaven.
Now that I've found the original lid, I have 2 bowls, and that's fine with me, because I know this product is good quality.
I may wind up giving one to my daughter when she moves away from home.
Like being able to pop corn without margarines or oils.
We have one of these currently in white and it's been AWESOME.
My wife made the mistake of leaving the lid on our stove and turning on a burner.
It does a decent job of salting the popcorn.
I still add a little more on top.
i didn't think about it but this is supposed to make 12 cups so it is large.
about 10 inches square and 5 1/2 inches tall.
the overwrap suggests that it can be used as a serving bowl for foods other than popcorn.
duhi'll have to report on it's popcorn making qualities.
I replaced my presto power pop (the one you have to use/buy the power concentrator cup/filters) with this popper and like it so much better.
I wanted to eliminate oil for a more healthful snack option and this popper allows that.
Clean-up is easy too - top shelf of the dishwasher.
I heard about this microwave popcorn maker and decided to give it a try.
The reason I gave it 4 stars is that there was a plastic smell coming from the bowl.
I hope it goes away after I put it in the dishwasher (top shelf only).
I was going to buy a very similar one when I saw this one advertised and decided to try it.
I have tried it both using oil and not using oil.
I put 1/3 cup in the bottom of this popper with or without oil and pop for 5 minutes.
For information on that, you will need to find another review.
But this popper works perfectly so I couldn't rate it down.
If you like popcorn bland, you'll like this popper.
If you like it with oil and seasoning, you'll like this popper, too.
I use it according to the direction without any oil.
I just apply popcorn salt after it has popped.
You should stand by the microwave while it is popping to ensure that it doesn't burn.
Now, popcorn can become the healthy snack it was meant to be.
I will never buy bagged popcorn again.On the bottom of the bowl it says it is ovensafe too up to 400 degrees Farenheit.
I won't be using it this way though.
It is BPA-free and very sturdy plastic, nothing thin or flimsy.
The top is soft plastic, for which degassing may be a concern.
Most recipes call for 1/2 teaspoon salt.RECOMMENDATIONS> I recommend coconut oil.
By the time the popping is less than continuous there are only a few dozen unpopped kernels remaining.
A dozen or so unpopped kernals cost nothing---this is not the time to get cheap.
If a significant portion of the popped corn is scorched, reduce the popping time next time.
If you feel that there are too many unpopped kernels, then try another brand of popcorn next time.
it developed a small crack in the rim.
I use it for popcorn and, more frequently, as a microwave vegetable steamer.
And willing to forgive the small crack as long as it stays small.
It's also not easy to get it out of the microwave when it's hot...it's bulky and hard to handle.
Make sure you stir the kernels and oil and I spread them out into an even layer as much as I can.
Listen carefully until there are like 2 seconds between pops.
There are kernels left behind that never pop, but I attribute that to maybe just bad kernels or something.
My bowl is stained a lot, but it doesn't alter the function at all.
My lid has warped however, and i will ask Nordic Ware for another one, since they say it doesn't.
It keeps the popcorn in the bowl, the main purpose of it anyway I think.
I think I will get a new one now, they are certainly cheap enough and of course Amazon stands behind whatever they sell.....LOVE Amazon!!.
Very few kernels unpopped and popcorn tastes great.
I have a low-powered microwave and this pops my corn very well.
Fluffy, crunchy kernels, no burning--though I keep a pretty close eye on it.
Use a bit less corn than what the directions call for as it pops up really well and fills the bowl right up.
Every microwave is different so you will need to experiment with the time.
I take it out of the microwave very carefully with 2 pot holders because it is VERY hot.
Then I dump it in another bowl because the popping bowls stays HOT for a while.
We do not add any extra butter or salt because it was popped it it already.
I have used several types of popcorn machines including the very overpriced Cuisinart machine (which I DO NOT recommend).
This bowl is simple, easy to clean, and does a great job.
We do not have a lot of kitchen space and this stacks nicely with other bowls and kitchen supplies.
I have no issues with burnt popcorn though using the popcorn button on the microwave does not work very well.
I have to put the popcorn in for longer than I would for a bag of microwave popcorn.
The best thing about this great little bowl is that bulk popcorn is cheaper and healthier than the bagged stuff.
For the price this gadget cannot be beat.
Popcorn popped on the stove with oil holds cheese sprinkled on it, this does not.
No the grated chefs, not powered cheese.Beyond that, WOW.Faster, more energy efficient, and a click above *zero* clean up.
Works wonderfully and I leave it right in the bowl so it stays warm.
A little spray butter and popcorn seasoning and I am in heaven!  Love this.
Pops in under 3 minutes in my microwave, with very few unpopped kernels.
I had one of these some years ago...not sure how I lost it...but am very glad to have found it again.
I prefer this to air-pop machines...more compact for storage, and multiple microwave uses possible.
I was questioning this product when I saw it demoed by several people on youtube.
I bought this because my daughter has the exact same one that she's used for years.
No butter, no oil, a couple of minutes and you have a beautiful bowl of perfectly cooked popcorn.
This is a nice product, though I find it to be rather inefficient in popping ALL kernals.
It also does not mix the flavored oils with the popcorn very well and leaves a hit or miss effect when consuming the popcorn.
However, it is better than most other popcorn poppers I have owned.
So, I still give it a 4 star rating.
I have been using this style of popcorn popper for years.
I like having the ability to use less oil (or no oil if that was my preference).
The container is hot when it is finished so it's a good idea to wear gloves when you remove it from the microwave.
I'm pleased that I can make my own popcorn without all of the chemicals that are contained in popcorn purchased in the store.
Nothing like popcorn in the evening when you just want a little something.
It's easy, no fuss, healthy, inexpensive and just hits the spot.
Yum! This popper is easy to clean and can be used as your serving bowl.
Bought it for myself and six of my friends.
I felt like Oprah sharing my FAVORITE things.
If you like using a microwave oven and enjoy popcorn, this item is just the ticket.
I aspire to both and really love this popper.
Be sure to read the instructions that come with it (e.g.
the popcorn will burn and smoke if overcooked).
I've used Jolly Time's 100% Organic Yellow Popping Corn with 2 Tbs.
margarine (any fat used is optional) and a bit of salt with terrific results.
I'm happily munching on it as I type this review.
I suggest having a 1,100 watt microwave to ensure the best result.
I have now tried Orville Redenbacher popcorn kernels with even better success.
The additives and saltiness in this kind of product are simply awful.
This little gem does the job beautifully, despite these other opinions to the contrary.
Other than that, I really like this popper.
I have tried several microwave type cookers for my popcorn needs.
All seem to do the job, but there is a vast difference in the result.
This is it for me!  Perfect popcorn, every time with NO oil (I tried it with Coconut Oil too, and it works just as well!).
The shape of the bowl provides space for expansion and even popping for the corn.
This is an inexpensive popcorn popper that works.
Takes some initial attention to sync the timing to get the cone popped without burning, but is definitely worth it.
I've had one of these poppers for years and always loved it.
When I picked it up off the shelf I thought it felt lighter than the old one, but thought maybe I was imagining things.
Tonight I used the new one for the first time I could see light through the plastic while the microwave was running.
The old one didn't do that so that answers why it felt lighter than my old one.
It does seem to pop as well as the old one so far.
Yes there are some unpopped kernels but no more than in a bag of microwave popcorn.
Yes the bottom gets hot but I actually like that, keeps the popcorn warm longer.
I just put a folded tea towel under it and eat out of the popper.
I only hope the new one holds up as long as the old one.
It is marked made in the USA on the bottom, so bonus points for that.
No more unhealthy bags of popcorn for us - this works perfectly and can be used for other things.
I also was able to get rid of the big stir-crazy which we liked, but took up too much room.
We got rid of ALL of our instant popcorn bags.
They are filled with lots and lots of calories.
Since we started Weight Watchers, we knew if we were going to eat any popcorn it had to be with no oil and no prepackaging.
First thought of an air popper, but this thing is so much better.
You can add oil to this, if wanted, but you do not have to put anything in....just some popcorn.
Depending on the power of your microwave, you will have to adjust the time on your popcorn.
If you really do the math, this is SOOO much cheaper in preparing popcorn.
Popcorn is cheap, and the prepackage bags are NOT cheap.
Popping in the Nordic Ware is much more healthy too.
I was so happy with this product I now eat popcorn ever second of every day.
For my GE over-the-range microwave, that's about six minutes.
And unlike the Presto, no disposable cup is required.I asked Orville Redenbacher about their premium popcorn (which is sometimes available in a big jug).
They said the moisture content wasn't appropriate for microwave cooking.
I use an inexpensive store brand, which works fine and tastes a lot better than microwave popcorn.
I then put it in the bowl and put the cover on and nuked away.
Three and a half minutes was good enough for my machine.
My first impression was wow all that popping going on was a good sign.
I do not want to go to my kitchen and find I can't make popcorn because I forget to buy some dumb paper.
This is a great way to make popcorn...super quick, no mess, and so much healthier than store-bought microwave popcorn.
Great way to make popcorn without adding a lot of calories.
Just a little olive oil in the bottom of the popper and then in the microwave.
Just a little salt and no calorie ICINB spray on the top.Directions come with the popper.
This popper dish is terrific!  I have had 3 of these and have given 2 away as gifts.
Definitely a must have if you don't want to scrub your microwave every two days.
However, for what it is, it's a bit overpriced.
Used it for five years, then bought a second one.
Be careful when taking the cover off after heating things,  frequently a lot of steam is realeased and often the lid is quite warm.
And many times I have used their microwave, always removing this contraption before sticking my food in it.
This is one of those kitchen gotta haves that is so simple but extremely useful.
We use ours (we have three) for covering bacon, reheated casserole servings, anything and everything that creates a mess in the microwave.
It prevents splatter, keeps fat from sticking to the top and sides of the microwave and is super easy to clean.
I'm buying my fourth Nordic Ware microwave plate cover in the last 8 years.
I like the way this cover fits over plates and containers, and we use it all the time.
It's large enough and tall enough to cover most dishes.
It's easy to clean, either by hand or in the dishwasher, and it keeps our microwave really clean.
It doesn't have a greasy feel to it like some plasticware after use.I like that it is rigid, and doesn't get hot.
It is nearly transparent so I can see the food through it.
Every one of these which I've owned has cracked within the first year, from the center hole out to the edge.
However, this does not impair its effectiveness, and it doesn't fall apart.
I had no expectations that this thing would last forever, and I just look at it as a disposable item.
There was a nice long melted area from the center to the edge following a crack.
And some pretty excited folks running around the kitchen.Overall, does its job well, it's inexpensive, but I wish they would improve the materials.
very satisfied - this is sturdy, pleasant to look at, does the job.
Made much better, more durable that previous microwave plate covers we have had.
and with kids in the house it takes a beating ...lol.
I bought this one for a friend who was using a paper towel.
It was appreciated by him and well used.
It fits on top of our large dinner plates and bowls and goes in the dishwasher every week or two.
This is VERY well made and does the job of keeping my microwave oven clean.
This is a hard plastic that wipes clean with just a swish of soapy water.
Just don't use the hole in the middle to pick it up!!!  Hello STEAM VENT.
I do find that I need a kitchen towel or pot holder to remove it from the dish after heating.
I'm thinking about buying this for my daughter in law now too.
This works very well, and it seems to cover everything we've tried it with so far.
Check out my review of the microwave splatter screen which we bought after seeing others who bought this plate cover buy it also.
This cover is a replacement for one just like it that we finally broke.
They work well and wash in the dishwasher just fine.
I got this to replace one of the collapsible kind.
This is much better and I expect it will be far more durable.
Solves the problem of finding something to cover a plate or bowl in the microwave.
How useful it is may depend on the height of your bowls and the diameter of the plates you use.
But it can rest on the rim of a bowl and still work.
Roizen say that it's okay to store food in these plastic containers, but not to cook in them.
So does this count as a cooking container?  My guess is that is does.
I don't know how long this will last, but it works perfectly right now.
Dummy that I am, I never realized this product was available until recently.
I have never been a big microwaving fan, feeling that it destroys the flavor of food.
But this definitely makes a difference and preserves the food way better than just open microwaving.
I will be a user of this device for as long as it lasts.
This product not only prevents splatter but I found the hole in the top helps the Auto cook function on our micro.
Without it using a glass cover or paper towel the function sensor is fooled and ends up over cooking or under cooking when reheating.
This works great and the auto function heats just right everytime.
I haven't had it more than 4 weeks so I can't comment on it's durability.
works great and saves from using paper towels, so it saves money.
Dishwasher safe and even the kids use it.
So much easier to clean than the entire microwave! I've seen some microwave plate covers that melt in the microwave, this one is great.
I have used paper towels for the last time to reheat leftovers.
This Nordic Ware 65004 11-Inch Microwave Plate Cover will fit over my microwave plates and provide that great splatter relief that I craved.
It is large enough to go completely over the plate, then lift off, before removing the plate from the Microwave.
It also provides a little vapor liquid on the glass microwave platter to allow a nice wet wipe if needed.
I love this thing!  I never microwave without it now.
All of my dishes and plates fit perfectly underneath it.
It catches all the splashes!  I haven't had one splash make it out of the hole on top.
It's dishwasher safe, it doesn't melt or smell bad when heated and it's really easy to clean.
No more wasting paper towels with this cover.
WARNING!!! Don't put finger in hole after heating.
When it gets dirty just pop it in dish washer.
I have the Nordic Ware Microwave plate cover and use it very often.
Not only is it one of the best buys I ever made, I was very happy to discover it is made in America.
Now I'm going to look for more Nordic Ware.
Anyone with a microwave needs one of these.
I rarely have to clean my microwave because I never get splatters.
This helps to keep my microwave clean and heats the food quicker thus saving time and money.
Just do not use the center hole to pick it up.
Works great, why didn't I think of getting this sooner.
Keeps microwave from getting all spattered and messy.
This works great, is inexpensive, and makes life just a little bit easier.
This is a microwave owners dream come true! It covers and fits over most plates or plastic containers and everything is clean and hot.
This is an ingenious, essential, inexpensive labor saving device.
True, you still must clean something after microwaving...the inside of the cover itself, but that is far easier than cleaning the interior of your oven.
Highly recommended product.I hope this was helpful to you.
If you have questions, please reply in the Comment section below...I would be glad to help.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________MY NEW BLOG: thegoodstuffreviews.blogspot.com.
When reheating anything with sauce you get splatters.
If you item is on a plate instead of in a bowl this is the cover you need.
It has a hole at the top that lets out steam but does not let out the splatters.
Easy to clean and so far, we love it.
it is just a piece of plastic, but it does what it is intended to do and cleans up well.
This has to have saved me at least 123151 hours* of microwave cleaning time.Hope this review helps!*rough estimate.
We've had a couple of these over the years and they tend to get brittle and crack.
This one seems to be a little softer plastic, but we'll see how it lasts being used in the micro over and over.
I suspect the plastic will get brittle in time.
I was hoping it would be more flexible plastic, but it works well.
The only problem is that it does scratch easily and will definitely crack if you drop it on the floor.
I always used paper towels when you had to cover an item but this solves that problem and is easy to clean.
This is a nice size to have for warming a full plate in the microwave.
I prefer this method to using plastic wrap.
So I figured the food would blow out the vent hole of the cover and splat the roof of my oven, but reduce the problem.
We use the oven mostly for reheating and melting.
It fits my tiny Sharp R-209KK 800 watt oven - a bit of an overhang but it has never fallen off the platter.2.
We used to use paper towel, or another dish to cover the food.
Here food cooks in a moist environment and doesn't 'explode' as much because of the steam regulation from the clever top vent.
Paper towel would always slide off or sink into the food and cook into the food and let food blast out the edges.4.
I guess because food explodes less it is easy to clean by dunking in my dishpan and rinsing.
If it is done cooking, I can leave the food in the microwave because the lid keeps it from drying out.6.
It works great on taller containers that still fit under the circle.
I have Rubbermaid microwave containers that are about 5 inchers tall and 5x5 inches at the base.
I can set this lid on top of the container.
The vent hole keeps the contents from blowing and protects the oven.The hole on top is not a finger hole.
Use pot holders to remove anything from a microwave.
It only takes one mishap to land a surprise burn.
Never assume a spot is safe to touch.I note the comments about breakage.
Dunk, swipe, rinse.I saw the cheap Chinese imitations.
I will stick with American made plastics for food prep and save a job too.
Nordic Ware is a great innovative companyAnd hey, if your food is piled higher than the cover you need something else.
I had one of these before that lasted a long time until it eventually cracked.
I bought another since it's good for larger plates.
Every microwave should come with one of these.
The microwave is so powerful that there tends to be splatter and this plate cover does a great job of keeping the microwave clean.
it is the size of a plate, perfectly covering a dinner plate or any regular sized dish.
We're on our second one of these in the last 5 years.
The first one eventually cracked and became badly deformed on the top.
When we need another one, I will buy the same one though as it works great.
It will cover anything up to a standard dinner plate.
Actually on a dinner plate the edge fits right on the rim of the plate.
I bought two so one is always sitting on top of the microwave so the user won't forget to use it.
This item covers a standard dinner plate or smaller items.
I use it all the time to prevent splatter from popping and exploding foods and it saves me a LOT of clean-up time.
It cleans easily and I store it in the microwave.
This is a very hard to find and often needed item for microwave use.
There is a hole in the middle which helps vent the heat and still prevents splatters all over while heating something.
I don't often use my microwave for total cooking, preferring just heating foods.
This is heavy gauge space age plastic that is not flimsy and is easily hand washed off.
I have since marked the replacement with a marker, hand wash only.
I have purchased three of these covers and they save a lot of clean up.
Nordic ware 65004 11 inch microwave plate cover.
this item is a nice product for every who owns a microwave.
Had high hopes for this item; it's a GREAT idea, perfect size for a dinner plate and smaller but arrived cracked.
Maybe slightly heavier plastic will prevent the cracks.
This is a good heavy weight microwave cover.
The plastic is rigid and fits right on our current set of stoneware plates.
It's lasted for at least a couple of years.
So I'm finally getting around to buying my wife a new one.
The cover measures 11&#34;, but my microwave carousel is over 12&#34;.
It would be awesome if Nordic Ware offered a larger cover, hence the 4 stars instead of 5 (hint, hint).
So I gave my neighbor mine and I ordered meyself another one.I read where someone said there were tiny cracks on the cover..yes.
mine had some..but in no way did it not serve its purpose,  The cracks did not bother me and it worked just fine.
Man if you have a microwave and hate cleaning it this item is the perfect purchase for you.
Just rinse it off after each use and it keeps your microwave clean as a whistle.
This is one of those things that once you try you can't live without.
I have always used plastic wrap to cover my food to put in the microwave.
I store it in the microwave and makes it so easy.
I've actually bought some for my other family members and they think it is one great contraption too.
Over time this will save money for the plastic wrap I normally buy.
I bought this in November of 2011 and we're still using it today.
It's durable and simple, and does exactly what it's supposed to do.
This works perfect, and has fit over every bowl I've used it with so far.Highly recommended!.
It keeps the inside of the microwave and it cleans up easily with a little soap and water.
I use this to cover anything I heat up on a paper plate or my Nordic ware plate.
Keep the inside of my microwave looking new.
Works well to keep splatters contained, and not all over inside your microwave.
Use it all the time in lieu of wasting plastic wrap to cook your meals and to chance plastic has leaked on your food.
A much safer way of heating up your meal.
It helps me tremendously when I have to reheat things for a late dinner, Highly recommend this to everyone.
The cover is made of good quailty see through plastic.
We have used and destroyed a few of these in kitchen mistakes.
This was higher than any of the others and much nicer.
CLEANED UP ALOT OF SPLATTERS AND HAD DRIED OUT FOOD BUT NOMORE.LOVE THIS PRODUCT.
I bought one for me and my daughter.
It's just the right size to fit over my large plates and saves using wax paper, paper towels or a paper plate.
Keep the microwave clean of spatters and pops.
I should have bought something like this a long time ago.
Prevents splashes from getting all over the walls and roof of the microwave.
Excellent design, sturdy so plates can be stacked in the microwave, functions perfectly.
My first thought was it seems thin and fragile, easily breakable.
It's simple fits the plates well seems to be just the right size, easily washable and it gets used constantly.
I now have my microwave privileges restored as long as I use this cover.
We have yet to accidentally drop it to see how it stands up to that.
We have used this for 7 months now without issue! Seems like the vast majority of the reviews agree this is a great product.
Sure there will always be a few people who encounter some sort of issue.
I stand behind my recommendation at least until I run into any issue.
I doubt I will but rest assured I will tell you about it.
I will buy another if I ever need to.
My favorite complaint was "it wont vent if you stack a dish on top of it".
Hmmm, ya think? Of course it wont vent your covering the vent hole.
Lets try and remember our reviews need to be fair or they are not helpful! Let's not blame the product for our stupidity.
Those of you who are complaining, "it's not large enough for your plates".
Just make sure it's the products fault and not your own stupidity.
Amend your review that are unfair to the company.
they avoided big messes, but were less than perfect.suddenly it dawned on me that i should have one of these to properly cover my food.
It now has wavy lines on the top , it isnt straight.
I use it every day to microwave frozen prepared dinners for my special diet.
Any one who has a microwave should have one of these.
In the past, I have used a succession of soft plastic, somewhat opaque plate covers from Bed, Bath & Beyond (but available everywhere).
In my particular circumstances, it sits on my Dansk dinner plate perfectly.Highly recommended.
I purchased this for use in my camper.
It seems great and has worked well when I have used it.
Definitely keeps in the inside of the microwave cleaner than just paper-towels (or nothing if you are one of those people).
I love this product! I had to buy another one because I accidentally damaged the one I had from moving.
works good for splatter but have to wash each time, seems like its not cheap material , so may be worth it to buy.
This plate cover is by far the best plate cover on the market.
It is long lasting, retains its appearance and works well.
I love it!  My only issue is that it will melt some if it comes in contact with an extremely hot item.
So far after a number of months this is the best.
I think this unit will last for 2 to 5 years easily.
It will fit a 10 inch plate and just barely a 10 1/2 inch plate.
If you have 11 or 12 inch plates you will need a larger cover.
In a moment of total weakness, I ordered this after having to clean out my microwave oven because of a tomato splatter.
I've used this cover a few times, and it does seem to work.
It's big enough to put a full size dinner plate on top of, and it works for most average size freezer special commercial dinners.
So far I have been happy with the purchase although it seems to be a bit expensive for a piece of plastic.
Are you ready for the miracle?  The thing is actually made in the USA!.
Great product, perfect size to use with even bigger sized dish.
Pretty sturdy plastic, just be careful to not to drop it on the hard floor!.
I love the size of this plate cover.
It allows the steam to escape while stopping splatters all over the inside of the microwave.
The size is perfect for covering larger dinner plates.
It saves a lot of time scrubbing the microwave.
I have a microwave drawer and this was the perfect little addition to keep the microwave clean.
This plate cover does not get spotted or stained in the microwave.
Easily clean with soap and water even after the plate has been sitting on the counter ffor a while.
I bought this cover when I ordered a new microwave.
I like the size and overall construction but would have preferred a vent that could be set to open or closed.
Love this item! It is larger than most you find in local stores, so it fits over a variety of plates.
Cleans easily by hand or in the dishwasher.
I bought several for me, my Mom & my sister & will probably get more in the future!.
for keeping splatters off of the microwave interior.
I deducted a star because a better design might have had a handle for lifting and an offset steam hole.
It works, is a good size , doesn't break easily.
You need this if you don't want to have to clean microwave frequently.
Years ago our son's elementary school sold these as a fund raiser.
He's now 20 and I just replaced it last October because it was looking a bit grubby and had cracks.
We obviously saved money over the years using less paper towels and cling wrap to prevent splatters.
I use these all the time for nachos in the Microwave to keep exploding beans and salsa off the roof of the inside.
This is my second buy of this product.
Overall the product is good, looks elegant, not some cheap plastic.
The reason I bought the second one was that the first one cracked up after some use ( 3-4 months).
However, I still bought this as I did not find anything better in the market.
It is not filmy like other versions I have seen.
It has been a great help keeping the microwave clean.
I like it because it is possible to check on how food is cooking without taking the lid off.
Unlike other microwave covers, this one is actually wide enough to fit around my big plates.
This cover does the job and I'm pleased with the results.
Reading the comments were a great help for my purchase.The cover keeps splatter and loss of moisture confined nicely.
After reading few reviews I decided to go with this cover & so far I like it.
My microwave plate cover shipped out immediately and arrived in perfect condition.
The Nordic Ware 65004 11-Inch Microwave Plate Cover is nice.
The only thing is you have to watch your fingers when you are take the cover off of your food.
This is a great value for the money.
Best microwave accessory I've ever bought, short of a roll of paper towels.
fits over almost everything we'd ever put in the MW.
I bought this cover in order to prevent endless internal microwave messes caused by uncovered food.
I had been using wax paper, but that has its own issues & annoyances.
Since all the steam from your now-hot food has to escape from underneath the cover, this hole provides the only outlet.
As a result, it gets very hot right around this hole.
You can remove the cover by grabbing the sides, but the one-handed convenience would have been nice.2.
I can say that the material of the Nordic Ware seems very sturdy & doesn't look like it will break down after repeated usage.
From a design standpoint though the Progressive International looks to be better.Overall, this does a great job of preventing messes inside the microwave.
The few complaints aren't enough to make me give up using it.
I love this cover and my microwave loves it too! It keeps my microwave clean by containging splatters from heating items in the microwave.
Arrived earlier than stated and I have used this same type of cover before and my microwave always looks like it is new.
I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER TO REPLACE THE PAPER TOWELS SHE USED TO PUT OVER MICROWAVE FOOD.
I LIKED HERS BETTER THAN THE ONE I'D HAD FOR YEARS AND REGRETTED NOT GETTING MYSELF ONE AS WELL.
I NOW HAVE ONE JUST LIKE MY DAUGHTERS! ;-).
I would use wrap or other plates to prevent messes and insulate dishes while cooking.
As long as you have a microwave, you'll need one of these.
I use it in conjunction with my microwave bacon cooker and splatter screen.
I wash it in the dishwasher and it fits right on my corelle plates.
I don't cook my foods in the microwave I use it just to heat left overs.
Play hard to find better, it is the best I have found to date.
I don't feel most of the complaints are warranted.
These covers work  reasonably well, they keep heat in and prevent most splatter.
The only problem is the hole in the center which can allow things that splatter to get through (though not often).
You can check by putting your hand a distance above the hole before attempting to remove the plate.
I accidentally burned the last plate cover that we had in our microwave by placing something plastic on top of it.
The plastic cover just melted and morphed shape so that it's no longer a flat surface on the top.
Well made, strong and good fit and function, covers most plates.
Buy one for the wife and make her happy!!.
It's not complicated, and truthfully, you can use a bowl or plate to accomplish the same task.
However, this really makes a difference in reducing the mess from food "explosions".
By leaving it stored in the microwave, everyone uses it which almost never happened before.
It fits perfectly on the glass turntable; cleans easily or throw it into the dishwasher.
it does let you view the food that you're heating.
Do NOT stick your finger in the center hole to lift if you have created a great deal of steam.
But you'll learn that pretty quickly on your own!.
This item is very sturdy and fits over a dinner plate nicely in the microwave.
I already had one (another brand) that I have had for years, so this one is nice for an extra to have on hand.
It should last as it is well made.
It is larger than many on the market.
It fits exactly on the rim of my particular dishes.
Mine is showing some wear after three years of almost daily/multiple use.
Just bought a new one to have a NEW one.
This is a nicely American made plate cover.
This probably is the best house-product I had bought in year 2012.
I didn't even know these things exist and now I love it.I always put plastic wrap around the plate & food to microwave it.
Easy cleaningI'm lazy and I never clean my microwave.
It's just annoying to clean the ceiling and all.
After a while, this amounts to very dirty microwave that I don't want to put my food in.
But not with this little gadget! This plate cover totally makes sure that food does not spatter everywhere in the microwave.
And if the plate cover gets dirty, I just pop it in the dishwasher.
Better FoodObviously having a cover will be better than no cover.3.
The Plate cover doesn't even really get hot, especially compared to the wrap I've been using.
I never had to use a mitten to take .the plastic cover out.
SturdyI had it for more than 6 months, and I've even been putting it in the dish washer.
Cover is high enough to cover any plate full of food.Fits turntable perfectly.Also fits standard size dinner plate.Keeps the inside of your microwave spotless.
Found this product to be a valuable addition for supporting microwave cooking.
Easy to use, aids in final microwave results, and elemenates other covering ulternatives.
This plate cover fits my dishes perfectly and it make reheating leftovers very easy without the need for plastic wraps.
Also good for reheating soups or stews in a bowl rather than reheating to much.
Hey it's a microwave plate cover, not much to say...it does the job...and it's really thick/quality plastic...that surprised me! Buy it.
Bought this to replace my original from 1982!  I guess that shows the quality of this product.
It fits on top of the Nordic Ware Microwave bacon/meat grill to help with splatters.
Love it, use it often, a must have in my kitchen.
It fits Nordic Ware's round bacon grill, perfectly.
It is clear, so you can see what you are cooking.
The first one I purchased lasted about 5 years with practically daily use.
This one is not as heavy duty as the first (less thick plastic) but so far so good.
Other &#34;reviewers&#34; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.
This is an exact replacement of what I had before which lasted many years.
I somehow managed to crack the old one and decided to replace it before it actually broke into pieces.
Yeah, the old one still worked, but $$$ was no object.
I know it seems a bit miserly, but pennies add up...especially in today's economy.
What I wanted was something I could reuse.
The cover is large, but it fits over all of my plates and is even tall enough for my soup bowls.
For storage, I simply keep it inside the microwave at all times.
And what the previous poster said about the design actually keeping the splatter to a minimum is absolutely true.
The other night, I microwaved a large plate (2 servings) of chicken parmesan for four minutes on high power.
The food was very hot when I was done.
The cheese was nicely melted but not dried out.
In fact, other than a bit of condensation from the steam, the Nordic Ware cover was spotless.
Quick wipe with a soapy rag, a quick rinse, and I was done with cleanup.
I love this! Keep the inside of my microwave clean, and keeps the food from drying out.
It is much easier to was this then to clean the inside of the microwave.
The only improvement I would like to see is for it to be a bit taller to accommodate the taller bowls I have.
The low price makes this a great value.
Has a center ventilation hole and fits standard plates.
Whether reheating pizza, cooking frozen meals, defrosting meats.
Good experience with company and item received as scheduled.
I would use them next time I need to order something.
My wife thinks this thing is cumbersome / unusual in the microwave, but coming from the guy who CLEANS the microwave, I love this thing.
It fits on 11&#34; plates, which we mostly use, and has little tabs that mount on the edge of the plate during heating.
I don't know what else to say about it, except I'm really pleased with it.
This is really worth the purchase and will gladly recommend it to others.
Never clean the whole microwave again, great gadget & it's easy to clean.
I've given these as gifts to very grateful friends.
Received this plate cover a few weeks ago and it does a great job of eliminating splaters.
Easily washable and is of very good quality.
I noticed after I bought one that IKEA has a cheaper one that's about the same quality.
I actually liked the looks of their microwave plate cover better.
I thought this was cheap, but there are cheaper apparently.
Not literally.This product works well at keeping grease and sauces from splashing around your microwave.
It handled some pretty tough messes over the last year and still looks brand new.
I bought it over cheaper ones only because I wanted to fill out my order to get free shipping.
I had melted my last one because I managed to leave it near a lit burner!  Not recommended.
I thought it was a great idea, would avoid sputters and splats in the microwave, so got one.
I truthfully haven't used it yet, but I feel it will be worth having.
It helps to reheat food and stops splatter as well.
Fits nicely over plates, blocks spatter, inside is relatively smooth and easy to clean every night.
Saves me five minutes of scrubbing the inside of the microwave every day.
Buying one as a gift now.Update:  It's developed a one inch crack near the vent ring and has warped in the same area.
It's go to be from the heat of the microwave.
I bought this cover to use with my new Corelle divided plates.
It works perfectly for my application, seems sturdy, and the hole in the middle should vent effectively.
However, it does seem to overstate what it delivers.
Specifically, my plates have a diameter of 10.2 inches and this cover sits perfectly on their rim.
However, it claims to fit plates up to 11-inches, which is overstated.
Also, it brags that you can stack a second plate on top of it to microwave 2 plates at once.
But as I said, it works fine with my plates, so I'm happy with it.
Have used it many times and not only cuts the times down but heats things very fast.
This is the best microwave reheating cover on the market.
This product is one of those little things that makes life easier on you.
I'm just happy that I don't have to clean out my microwave as frequently as I used to.
Used to be any time I put a bowl of soup it would bubble and splatter all over.
Now, I just pop this little cover over it and there are no problems.
My use of cling/saran wrap has gone down 95%.
I have a average size microwave and 2 will fit in mine.
The Nordic Ware 65004 11&#34; Plate Cover is awesome! It fits in our microwave perfectly, and covers literally anything we need heated or defrosted.
It works like it says and would buy again if I need another one.
I had been using a Pyrex custard dish to in the microwave, until it broke.
This little tool is perfect and can't understand why I never invested in one before.
Works great.The eggs need just a little bit of water to come out right.The one con is cleanup.
Sometimes the egg white will get &#34;baked on&#34; and it requires some elbow grease to get it off.Normally, throwing it in the dishwasher works fine.
I have owned this poacher for about five years, and we poach eggs several times a week.
I have only tried this once and the eggs were hard-boiled and also exploded all over the microwave.
Yes, I thought I pricked the yolks but must not have done it correctly.
The poacher does allow explosions to exit the closed poacher and make cleaning the microwave a huge chore.
I will keep working with it as the idea behind it is sound.
Yes, the yolk is a teeny weeny bit overdone, but still runny enough to dip toast in.
There seems to be too many perfectionists out there...just scramble and cook if ya can't get it perfect!.
I've wanted an egg poacher for a long time.
My parents had one of the little two  container,one for water and one for the egg, potsthat we used a lot.
Now they are expensive so I tried this one.
After a couple of tries I got the timing on my microwave right and it produces nice poach eggs.
I would use less than a minute to start, say around 50 or 55 sec with one egg.
I broke the latch on the last one I had but it was my fault it is actually very sturdy.
I ordered a second right away as I love an easy poached eggs on toast for breakfast.
No mess from pans, and quick...60 secs and you got eggs.
Highly recommend especially if you've never had one.
I have a 1000 watt microwave and set the time to 1 minute 15 seconds at power level 7 for one egg.
Add a little water on top of the egg, close the lid AND PUT A RUBBER BAND AROUND THE HANDLE.
This will keep it from opening up if one of the eggs explodes and making a mess out of your microwave.
Works like a charm and makes a perfect poached egg.
Work great in the microwave, easy to use and keep clean.
I put them on the top rack of the dishwasher and they do not get warped by the heat.
This makes poaching eggs easy to make! It also cleans easily.
If you remove the nub, it works just fine.
All in all, it's the easiest way to make poached eggs.
I butter the bottom, drop in an egg, microwave 30 seconds and a perfect soft cooked egg.
My microwave is high voltage, so lower watt microwaves increase time as needed, or decrease time as needed.
I am so pleased I am ordering another one.
in one minute with a 900W microwave oven, this is the ticket, especially if one likes one's "poached" eggs soft but not runny.
I use only the Certified Organic brown eggs that are offered by a well-known national "wholesale store" whose name begins with a C.
This product poaches eggs perfectly and no oil is needed for the finished product.
The only fat that is added is from the hollandaise sauce.
I love this thing! Quick poached eggs in one minute in the microwave.
Be careful when opening and closing this before and after cooking.
I love these, but the only problem I had was that the hinges were broken on the first two I ordered.
This is a fast, clean way to cook two eggs, suitable for breakfast egg sandwiches.
It is not possible to get a true poached egg, but that's okay.
My over-the-stove microwave only needed 55 seconds to cook two eggs until set through.
This makes it so easy to quickly cook an egg in the morning.
It's also healthier because you use no oil or butter.
Afterwards you can just put it in the dishwasher and it washes clean.
Next you experiment until you get the desired doneness.
For me, 1 minute in our microwave is great, but my husband likes around 50 seconds.
Make a couple of eggs in a minute.
I use mine with pancakes or egg sandwiches.
The key to satisfaction with this product is not to expect perfect poached eggs using a microwave.
It's not that the product itself is poorly designed, although as some have pointed out, the hinge could be stronger.
It's that microwave ovens really aren't designed for gourmet cooking.
They heat things up quickly--that's what they do.
Microwaves are all about convenience, and if you want decent poached eggs in a minute, this will do it.
Neither the whites nor yolks were completely hard, which is what I was looking for.
Really, not bad at all, considering the convenience.
I've been using one of these about twice a week for the past few years, and just bought another for my vacation home.
They work just great, it's hard to imagine why the people giving negative reviews are struggling so much.
Like any microwave cooking product, it takes some experimenting to dial in the exact cooking time and procedure that works for you.
I've also never had a hinge break, after hundreds of uses.
Use 5 1/2 minutes at 30% power with a 1.2kw oven, with a little water in the bottom.
This is a great way to poach eggs.
Brought this for my daughter who is going to college.
I use this a few times a week for a quick easy breakfast.
I spray with olive oil first and it washes clean very easily.
I was having a soft boiled egg 5 days a week and it was a bit time consuming.
Now I use this product and am very happy with it.
Does it make a perfect poached egg? No.
But you are dealing with a microwave and they cook unevenly.
With a little trial and error you can make a decent egg.
I use 1 large egg and cook it for 1 minute and 10 seconds on power 4.
Our Saturday morning treat is to have homemade egg - English muffin sandwiches.
However, I have had the hinges break on me (after a long time) and this is my second one.
They last a long time, but they can break.
Remember to adjust and experiment for your microwave oven.
My only recommendation is to not rely on the snapping action of the handle to hold the poacher together when you encounter &#34;pops&#34; while cooking.
If you can keep it together then it works well.
If you can't keep it together then you will be cleaning the inside of the microwave.
My wife decided to try a hair barrette around the handle and it worked perfectly.
I am sure a good rubber band would work as well.
We have our own hens and enjoy fresh free range eggs.
It is a perfect complement to our lifestyle.
It recently broke after many years of faithful service.
I was surprised and pleased to see that they are still available.
This one is much better then the one I had....more sensitive to pressure, to start the motion.
I love it, and received it in a few days.
I like it since I have an older Microwave.
I would recommend to anyone that has an old microwave.
Works well as I was sure it would as I had an identical turntable that I used for almost 25 years.
I purchased this for a friend who has a microwave that does not have a turntable.
He loves it and is pleased that he no longer has to periodically stop the microwave, mid heating, to turn whatever he is cooking.
Worked very well on my microwave that didn't have a turntable.
I now have a microwave with a turntable so no longer need one.
What's a person to do?  Amazon to the rescue again.This fits perfectly in my microwave and works like a charm.
It's easy to wind up and lasts quite a long time in between.Sturdy and easy to clean.
This purchase made my third Micro-Go-Round in more than 25 years.
On average I've gotten almost 13 years constant use from each one.
When you have a 36 year old microwave (yes, really.
It's a Litton, big enough for a 20# turkey, works perfectly and has never needed repair.
No, they don't make them like that anymore).
For any of you who may have a similar scenario, I highly recommend the Micro-Go-Round and feel its investment is worth every penny.
We had one for years and were lost without when it died.
It's the greatest when you don't have a microwave with a built in turntable.I would recommend this.
The motor in the microwave at work broke so the glass shelf wouldn't turn.
This was cheaper than fixing the motor or replacing the microwave and it works great.
It's a must have if your microwave oven does not have a built-in turn-table.
Eliminates the need to manually rotate your food items.
The motor of the turntable in my GE Microwave went out.
This gadget saved me from buying another $500.
It does what it is supposed to: turn the food while cooking and I am very happy with it.
Pressure from a dish being placed on it will make it turn which I think is really ingenious.
I've had my Nordic Ware Micro-Go-Round for a month and am using it several times a day.
It is easy to use and works works perfectly.
This is the perfect accessory for my new awesome Electrolux microwave.
This turntable works well, winds up easily and takes away the need to hand turn food.
I'm careful not to over wind it and it's easily cleaned with a wet sponge.
I'm very glad to have found a replacement for my 20+ year old Nordic Micro-go-Round.
The new one winds up by using three finger/thumb indentations on the bottom of the unit.
The flat top surface makes cleanup fairly easy.
The mechanism starts when you put weight on it.
For lighter items, I push down on the unit with my hand.
Once in operation, it seems to keep going without additional assistance.
I love the fact that when you take the item off the turn table, the mechanism automatically stops.
My microwave is 30+ years old (a Litton with Sears Kenmore branding).
If it would ever give up the ghost, my next microwave would have a built-in turn table.
I purchased this through Amazon 3 years ago.
I have been using it consistently in my microwave/convection oven for all this time.
It is just now starting to break down on me.
I have had zero problems with it and plan to buy another when this one goes belly up.
This turntable works like a charm in my microwave.
The minuses are that it uses a spring/coil mechanism, so you have to rewind it when it uncoils all of the way.
And secondly, there is not an indicator to let you know how much tension is left in the spring.
With that feature, you could easily tell if it needed to be wound up before you started cooking.
This is the perfect solution to the problem of having a Microwave with No Turntable!Works great and arrived fast!.
We had our old Micro-go-round for about 15 years.
Someday I'll upgrade to a microwave with a turntable but in the meantime, this is a great product.
We owned one of these and it lasted for years and years.
So, naturally, when it finally died we bought another one.
Its weight activated so when you set your dish down on it it begins to spin.
When you lift the dish out of the microwave it stops spinning.
That way you don't have to constantly wind it.
One quick wind lasts for about two weeks in our house which is great.
I have been using it for a while and I have no complaints.
It winds easily and doesn't really take too much weight to get it going.
My microwave is 32 years old and doesn't have a turning table but this microwave turntable works great.
This is the third one I have bought for my microwave.
Even though there is usually a 5 year warranty, mine usually last about 8 years.
This is a lifesaver in our motorhome, convection/microwave combo did not come with a carosel for some reason.
Just tried this for the first time last month and it works great.
What a difference in the evenness of the cooking.
No batteries to worry about, just wind up.
Great value, and have found nothing else like it.
it does just what it,s suppose to do---you have to be careful not to over wind it---I am satisfied with product.
Provides the support product necessary for best microwave results.
I have used this product for several years and only recently did the old one quit working because I over wound it by mistake.
They are very sturdy and the food always cooks evenly.
Simple! Does the job it was intended for.
I read where others have had problems but I have not had one single issue.
There, problem solved! I did expect it to turn faster than it does but, the RPM's are not an issue at all.
The slow speed it turns has not been a problem at all.
It keeps my food from having to be turned by hand and getting hard in one spot.
This was a gift to my Nephew...and it saved him the expense of having to pull his built-in Microwave out for expensive repairs.
Perfect for small families who don't always want to bake a big cake.
The jiffy cake mixes are just right for the small pan.
These pans are well made and clean up extremely well after use.
I am pleased with their stylish red exterior! Lovely to look at , and functional!.
i rec'd red and white colored pans and not what is pictured (dark gray).
perfect for sticky buns i make for christmas brunch!.
They looked and seamed to be what I wanted for my daughter-in-law.
I was pleased and would tell others the same.
I previously ordered two other bundt pans from Amazon and really only got these because they were so cheap.
As all other customers have said, upon delivery you realize they are actually red and cream and look a lot less durable.
My other two are heavy duty aluminum that look like I'll be able to keep in the family.
I just received my set of bundt pans and I am pleased with them.
The listing description should note the possibility of different color items, even if we can't choose which color.
Which is fine but just something some people may want to know.
I use the smaller one for making fruit filled ice rings for punch bowls.
I use these for making drunken bundt cakery Big Bundt size and Couples Bundt size cakes.
The 12 cup pan creates a drunken bundt cake with a tall profile that is smooth and without crumbs for glazing.
These come clean without using a net shower pouf.
I use this mostly for jerky but occasionally for other foods.
Unlike some dehydrators, this one has variable heat settings.
I've loaned mine out several times and each time the person has bought one for their own household.
I figure that's the best review of all.
I bought this dehydrator to make beef jerky and have made about 4 pounds so far.
Actually is hard to get snack food without preservatives or anyother dangerus additives, so you have to create your snacks by yourself.
I purchased this back in 2001 and also purchased two additional trays.
I've used it for making jerky, my wife uses it for drying herbs, flowers, fruits, and even projects.
After 13 years of light use, it's still working as well as the day I purchased it.
It's not a glamorous item, but it works fairly well and just keeps working year after year.
That should be all the selling point it needs.
I bought this based on the good reviews and dried some canned pineapple, fresh pears, strawberries, and bananas on my first use.
I spaced everything so that no food touched, checked the drying at 6, 8 and 10 hours.
It took about 10 hrs for everything to be dried and they turned out great.
I'm currently borrowing this model from a friend to process some of our summer salsa garden.
It's very efficient, quiet but not real quiet, and easy to clean.
We dried some apple slices dipped in pineapple juice, sugar and cinnamon to ship to my nephew who is stationed in Afghanistan.
We put them in hot sudsy water and the goo just softened up and rinsed away.
We've been drying hot pepper varieties raw and par-boiled at almost 24 hours!  Some were &quot;whole&quot; and some were sliced.
I must add however, that I have intentions of owning one nontheless.
This is a basic, no frills model but it seemed to do the job very nicely.
I do not know what the more expensice models give you but I doubt if much more.
The meat was dehydrated in 5-7 hours and it came out perfect.Negatives: The fan is loud and could be heard from other rooms.
A nice feature to have would have been a built in timer instead of having to buy an external one.
I'm a raw foodist, and it works well enough for me.
This version does have a temperature adjuster--important to raw foodists.
I had messed with some cheaper dehydrators in the past and when I discovered my last one dead I went out and got this one.
Does Jerky in 4hrs and Applechips in less than 6.
My only wish is that this had an off switch.
I feel asleep one evening and forgot it was running and then next morning everything was ruined.
Since then I have learned to use a light timer.
We bought the dehydrator three years ago and it has exceeded our expectations.
I'm sure that you've bought gadgets that languished in the kitchen and eventually migrated to the garage before finally being exiled to your favorite charity.
I'll bet that it doesn't happen much with these things, especially if you're a gardener...even if you only grow a few herbs.
Just run them through the corer/slicer, soak them in the cheapest pineapple juice you can find.
I've tried jerky and it was terrific but it was a lot of trouble and a huge mess; not worth it to me.
Anyhow these little American Harvest Snackmasters are one of those kitchen gadgets you will use forever if you like food.
I bought these trays for my nesco Snackmaster FD-60.
Even though it says these fit the FD-50, they fit mine as well.
My dehydrator  is the one with the motor on top.
These trays are the exact same ones that came with my machine.
I purchased these to build on my dehydrator set.
I ordered 2 sets of 2 so that I'd have 6 trays in total.
They work great, they fit my dehydrator perfectly, they are easy to clean, and best of all, they are easy to use.
Not only would I recommend the Nesco Add-A-Trays, but I'd recommend the Nesco Dehydrators overall!.
One of my two trays also arrived warped, as described by Bags and Sassy Electra previously.
Don't know if this is a quality control problem or just that the plastic sets up a little differently each time.
I'm happy with my set, in spite of this minor issue.
Bought new dehydrators capable of drying 12 racks at a time so I bought this pair to expand production.
Easy to clean, place on dehydrator to dry.
I've got the old 50 model and I wanted 9-10 trays instead of 8.
My unit came with 4 and I bought four more but when I do deer jerky it's still not enough.
These trays are cheap and last for years.
Helps a lot to spray with cooking oil before using the trays.
Then they clean up easily in the dishwasher.
Before I would spray the trays, the meat stuck horribly.
Wow!  These trays added a lot of room to my dehydrator.
I purchased 4 of them and the dehydrator didn't have any trouble at all drying that much.
I will be buying 4 more to max out the capacity of this dryer.
Not much to say- the replacement trays, while not identical in appearance to the original trays fit together fine and expand the capacity of dehydrator.
They arrived promptly and the cost was reasonable.
These are not identical to the ones on my American Harvester FD-40 dehydrator but the fit it nicely.
It's like having two American Harvesters in one unit.
I had four trays and bought four more.
4 is a no brainer because of the free shipping.
It is great!  Ground burger ends up as jerky quickly and easily.
I needed more than 4 trays and now that I have the two extras I use 6 most every time.
They fit perfectly and do a good job.
I recommend getting the number of trays you need.
Only con is that they are hard to clean with all the slits in them.
We have an older dehydrator and were afraid that these may not fit.
My original machine is 20 yrs old and still working just great.
No reason for me to buy a new machine just added more layers.
these extra dehydrator trays sure did come in handy making Jerky., my grandson eats as fast as I can make it.
they are the same as the originals and fit my FD-60 great! worth the money, bought 3 more sets.
My boyfriend loves making jerky and always needed extra trays.
cleaning it isnt so fun, but work the extra trays for the extra things he makes!.
We needed more than the 4 trays that the machine came with to feed my husbands jerky obsession.
Now we can make 5 lbs of jerky every week.
match the exact model i have and serves it's purpose.
These are great for added space in the dehydrator.
Doing lots of dried fruit and vegetables so the extra capacity came in handy.
I use these all the time with no issues.
Recommend the optional silicone liners to make cleaning a lot easier though.
These trays add enough extra space to my dehydrator that I can actually feel like I'm getting a good supply of end product.
Seems like the original 4 trays just weren't quite enough for me.
These are easy to clean and a perfect fit.
Needed more room for my Jerky so added two more trays.
The dehydrator still did the job and the extra trays worked just fine.
What can I say, their extra trays for your dehydrator.
Match the model number and your good to go.
They were the same as the originals that came with my dehydrator several years ago.
They do not match the original trays, they are slightly different in the center, but the do fit with no problem.
Ther are also about 1 shade whiter than than the existing trays.
I got my son the NESCO FD-75A 700 watt dehydrator for Christmas.
This is the natural add on and seems to keep the food items from wedging into the shelving holes.
I forgot to read the instructions to see if they're dishwasher safe, but we have been running them through and they seem fine.
I used these for the first time yesterday to make tomato leather.
I love it, and will be snacking on it for some time now.
I'll also be making a lot of fruit leathers now that I have the way to do it.
if you like to dehydrate small or sticky/sugary foods.
Perfect for berries or small chunks of fruits/vegetables; came in handy with drying herbs as well.
They keep the small stuff from falling through to the bottom or lower trays, and it makes clean up of the sticky stuff a cinch.
I have a cheap dehydrator but needed the Clean Screens to dehydrate some veggies and found these.
They didn't fit my machine but with just a little trimming they looked like they were made for my machine.
I will be looking at their dehydrators next.
These fit fine, I just wish they didn't cost so much for plastic items.
Otherwise, they are good for making fruit leather.
I had the model from the mid 1980s and gave it away 2 years ago because I didn't think I would use it again.
I found I missed it and bought this model a month ago.
This one is faster and I love the results.
I needed these for my trays when drying herbs and frozen veggies.
Worked great, wish I had more of them!.
Love these because they allow me to dehydrate the peaches, pineapple, tomatoes I canned.
They wash up easily and have been getting used many times during the week.
Have tiny 'stuff' to dehydrate, use a screen tray.
When I am done I toss the screens and the trays in my dishwasher.
Well made and I expect to never have to replace them.
Good to have a couple even if 'this moment' you do not have small items.
You will!!  and then you will order the screens.
These screens are also really easy to clean, an added plus! I highly recommend these trays if you plan on drying fruit.
These trays make it possible to dehydrate smaller pieces, herbs, flowers, etc., without them falling to the bottom of the dehydrator.
Plus, because they are flexible, they can bend to make removing things much easier.
These screen trays are perfect for dehydrating small foods such as herbs, or even larger fruits that shrivel down to small size once dried.
After drying for 20 plus years and messing around cleaning the trays I discovered these nice little screens.
Lightly oil them and put anything you're drying on them.
Food peels right off, unbelievable how easy the clean up is.
Soak them in hot, soapy water for a minute or two, brush gently, rinse and dry in dehydrator.
Now smaller foods won't fall through the cracks.
They have held up well with hand washing in soapy water.
I just let them soak a few minutes.
I have had no tearing, discoloration, or other issues.
I do tremendous amounts of drying here and these screens are an absolute blessing.
Makes drying small fruit much easier! I make homemade raisins from red grapes (delicious!), these trays make that process a snap!  Very easy to clean.
I am glad that I ordered extra Clean-A-Screen tray when I ordered my Dehydrator.
I am using all of the ones I ordered and I may have to order another set.
They work great to drying herbs, which is very small.
I have now eight of them and use them for most drying.
I have read that cheesecloth can be used too--might try it, it can be washed and reused.
You couldn't find a better tool for dehydrating foods.
Has made life so much easier in emptying the tray AND cleaning the screen itself.
Clean up is simpler with these Nesco American Harvest Clean-A-Screen Trays, but hand washing them is not so simple.
I was pleased to find these trays to fit my FD-35 Nesco Deydrator.
I haven't used them yet but I know they will be fine.
I purchased these last summer when I started dehydrating and boy I quickly found out they are the perfect item for my Nesco Dehydrator.
I do!  I don't like having to purchase dried seasoning with additives.
Especially browned dried onions that come in a soup mix with all the salt.
The trays are easy to clean and hold more than you think.
I dry herbs, fruits and vegetables fresh from my garden.
The extra trays allow me to take advantage of dying a larger harvest.
If you own a Nesco Dehydrator extra trays are a must.
The screens work great and I needed the screens because of the small things I dehydrate.
The screens are easier to clean than the trays.
Squirting them with water usually cleans them without rubbing.
They're easy to clean and seem very sturdy.
Just got a new Nesco Dehydrator and it only came with 2 of these screens.
Since the dehydrator only came with 5 trays, I've now got an extra, but you just can't beat the price here, especially with Amazon Prime!!.
We have a Nesco FD75 dehydrator but it only came with 2 screen trays.
The screen trays are essential for anything small and for jerky.We ordered 6 extra screen trays for a total of 8.
This allows us to make bunches and bunches of dehydrated veggies and jerky treats for the mutts.
These are great, they keep your veggies from sticking to the trays, and herbs from falling through the cracks.
It's a lot easier putting 12 of these in the sink, than 12 of the trays!.
I wouldn't wanna try bananas and pineapple without these bad boys.
I needed 2 more screens to have 4 for my dehydrator.
I've read things that people use parchment and other stuff instead but it seems like such a hassle considering these things last forever.
We have an apricot tree at my parents' house and my dad used to love to make frozen apricots.
If you are into dehydrating your produce, these tray inserts come out so you can scrape off the dried product and wash them easily.
I wish these and the jerky-fruit-leather sheets came with the dehydrator but they don't.
If you grow vegetables and fruits, this is very useful for processing your crop.
We bought the Clean-A-Screen Tray to use with our food dehydrator.
Using the Tray expands the types of foods you can dehydrate without making a big, hard to clean, mess.
these clean screen for the dehydrator work good., but I really don't use them not yet anyway.
I bought enough of these inserts to use with every original tray.
While I don't always need them all, it surely speeds everything up if you have them on hand.
I bought this to make chicken jerky for my dog treats and to dry spices for an herbal concoction I put into capsules.
These are a perfect fit to expand the dehydrator that I purchased on Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVJ3C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_2.
Might be a good dehydrator out there that comes with them (making the price better) but if yours didn't...these fit and work fine.
I bought a couple of these before and figured it'd be nice to have a couple more.
I've had my dehydrator for quite awhile and I needed some more screens so I came here to get them.
Right now I'm doing 7 trays of frozen vegetables but needed two more screens, at least.
The price on amazon is the best I've seen anywhere.
I intend to get more of the fruit roll sheets also.
I love this dehydrator, I had thought of getting the Excalibur but the price is a little high.
Dehydrators are the best for saving money on food and having vegetables dried and ready to use is great.
I love my dehydrator an first want to make my own spices.
These will help little leaves from sliding through the cracks.
Orange peel turned out awesome! I can't wait to do basil and Rosemary.
Worked like a charm for jerky, strawberries and mango in just the last few weeks.
these are so easy to use and clean.
it makes smaller pieces so much easier to handle.
Excellent!  I highly recommend purchasing this item along with your Nesco FD-60 Snackmaster Express.
I was able to start dehydrating my grapes the next day and was very pleased with the results.
Just slice each grape a bit so that the insides are open for better dehydration and lay it on your screen.
The raisins turned out beautifully and the 2 screens were easy to clean!.
They allow you to pick up the clean-a-screen when you're done hydrating and flex them so the stuck items just pop off.
I actually use them with everything I dehydrate.
Plus they seem to hold up really well.
I tried drying thinly-sliced strawberries on the unlined trays and they stuck horribly.
The flexible plastic liners make all the difference:  the fruit still sticks but when you flex the screening the fruit just pops off.
The screens are super-easy to clean, since there's far less surface area that the fruit actually touches.
I highly recommend these for fruit and imagine they would also help for other sticky foods.
I used this on bananna slices and they came up easy.
THere was still some left overs came off on the screen but it was easily cleaned up with some hot water (no real scrubbing needed).
this is a must have if you plan on dehydrating strawberries or pineapple from a can.
Life is so much easier when you're peeling off that sticky stuff once dehydrated! It bends and flexes like a sheet of cardboard paper.
This is the second order for these trays.
I use these trays for everything that I dehydrate - makes it so easy to bottle up whatever I have dried.
They are great for spices and fruit - even jerky.
I can make not only fruit rolls with the fruit roll sheets, but I can use it for flat breads and more more more!.
Lines my Nesco dehydrated purchased from Wal-Mart, perfectly.
No more scrubbing with bits of food, herbs, etc.
They should include these with the original deyhydrator.
This is a nice addition to my Nesco professional dehydrator.Worked exactly as should and no food stuck to it.Fits perfect!Five stars ***** all the way!!.
We bought our first several screens about 4 years ago to cover broken spines in our old Harvest Maid dehydrator racks.
However we discovered to our delight that dried food came off these screens very easily versus the regular racks.
Just twist and pour onto a baking sheet.
We have now ordered enough to use on all of our racks.
We no longer put food items directly on the racks.
It sure makes cleaning a lot easier.The reason for the 4 stars:  The screens all have a slight bow around the edges.
The bow makes it difficult to put light weight food along the edges.
I purchased these for my Nesco Dehydrator and they work great when I dry ground beef jerky.
The meat does not stick and it is very easy to remove once dried.
I bought 2 sets of these and plan to get 2 more sets soon.
These performed as advertised and made clean up so much easier than just placing the foods on the trays.
Making jerky or drying soaked freshly blanched almonds etc makes it easy to lift off the dehydrator.
I put one underneath of all the trays when I am making jerky to catch any drips.
Ahhh, no more sticky mango slices! Or pineapple, or ...I bet you could put carmel on it and it wouldn't stick!.
One of my favorite things to dehydrate are bananas, and these trays make it much easier with a lot less sticking.
One of the comments here is that the trays are not flat.
Well, in my opinion the plastic trays in the dehydrator are not flat.
Turn that side up and the tray appears warped, but they work fine with very little sticking.
Anyway, with two more trays I'm looking forward to making twice as many banana chips as before.
BTW, dry your chips for a full 24 hours and they'll be nice and crunchy.
I bought these to use in my dehydrator for spinach, black beans, mushrooms.
A lot thicker material than the ones that came with my Nesco.
Makes it easy to pick up screen with items, then pour the items into your container, bag, etc.
These plastic flexible trays are absolutely the best addition to my Nesco food dehydrators.If you are dehydrating small pieces eg.
chopped vegs....these trays will keep your food from slipping thru the drying racks and ending up on the bottom of the dehydrator.
They are a must for drying small herbs.
Flexable allowing for easy &#34;funneling&#34; into containers or grinders as well.
These screens make cleaning up after certain foods much easier.
Sometimes you do not even have to wash the trays themselves, just the screens.
I dry banana chips and other fruits, and the flexibility of the screens makes it very easy to release the fruit from the tray.
They are also invaluable if you dry small or fragile items such as herbs that would drop through the trays.
I like to dehydrate jerky made from a jerky gun.
When I would squirt the jerky straight onto the trays it would tend to swell into the grills of the tray.
This made it harder to remove and made cleanup a real mess.
What little mess it creates is much easier to cleanup since it is on the surface and not in between the grids.
For cleanup I leave the screen on the tray and use a nylong scrub brush.
Works better than sponge or pad.Of course you can also use these to dry smaller items that might fall through.
But thats not my big concern right now.
I'm happy to have less mess.The only drawback I see is that they are overpriced.
Also to make sure you cover all of your trays you have to buy 2 packs.
I have used the screens and found them useful for drying tomatoes and peaches.
But I found the Nesco dehydrator took a lot longer to dry fruit than I expected.
These trays fit the Nesco dehydrator I purchased.
They are used mainly to dry very small things like herbs from the garden.
Anything that will fall through the normal trays once they are dried qualifies for use on these.
Sure, you can buy 4 sets and then throw one tray away.
I needed more trays for my dehydrator, so I purchased two more of these.
There is a limit to the number of trays you can use for my dehydrator.
I added so I could do what I needed to do at one time.
Worked fine for what I wanted it to do.
These are simply a plastic mesh sheet that fit onto your food dehydrator tray.
The mesh is finer than the the standard tray, which keeps food from falling through.
The are made to fit the model of dehydrator that I have.
What's not to like?  Easy to clean too.
These work great for my Nesco Snackmaster dehydrator.
I was very happy that they came in a 2 pack because 1 just really isn't enough.
They are easy to clean, use, and store.
I used mine the first time to make tomato leather, and it is the best I have ever had.
I use it in some recipes, but mostly as a snack when I want something good for me and don't have chocolate on hand.
I'll be making fruit leather, sweet potato leather, and anything else I can think of all winter long with these.
I have a cheap dehydrator but needed the fruit roll up sheets and found these.
They didn't fit my machine but with just a little trimming they looked like they were made for my machine.
I will be looking at their dehydrators next.
Nesco LSS-2-6 Fruit Roll Sheets for FD-28JX/FD-37/FD-60/FD-61/FD-6 1WHC/FD75A and FD-75PR, Set of 2This was the slowest part I ordered to get.
Fruit Sheets ! ( worth the wait )I love my FD 75 PR 700 w Dehydrator.
These fruit roll sheets are so easy to clean and it makes creating fruit leathers simple.
I highly recommend buying these sheets if you want to make anything that is liquidy or smooth in the dehydrator.
One of the more fun things to create in a dehydrator are homemade fruit rolls.
I've used my sheets for various fruits and yogurts and the snacks they yield are really tasty.
They are flexible and therefore make removing your food items easy.
I dehydrate everything and especially fruit roll ups using raspberries.
I needed more four more and ordered them.
Much to my delight they came two to a pack so I am ready for anything.
I use straight ,blended fruit, not using applesauce as receipts suggest.
These are exactly like the one that came with my dehydrater.
I needed 4 more to be able to make lots of fruit rolls and these were it.
They are easy to clean and make delicious fruit rolls! Not much else to say about them.
These are helpful in making fruit rollups and dehydrating sauces.
My dehydrator came with only two of these.
I can make a lot more fruit leather and dry sauce ect.
I am new in all this food drying world.
Bought this drier and now I consider these Roll Sheets, the perfect cooking gadget.
Just use some imagination and you will create your own flavors and recipes.
I would really recommend this item if you are one of those who intuitive cookers.
Just as others said fits my system even if it was made for Nesco.
My new dehydrator machine only came with two.
I bought the Nesco Dehydrator and needed the Fruit Roll Sheets.
It makes it so simple to make Fruit Rolls.
If you haven't made home made - you are missing the real flavor of the fruit,.
Used for expansion of our Nesco dehydrators - work well, fit and finish is good - will buy more in the future.
Definite buy!  These work great with my dehydrator and easy to clean, store and use.
Bought some extra to go with my dehydrator.
I know they are called fruit roll sheets, but honestly, we hardly ever use them for fruit.
Anything liquid, or that may fall through small cracks, we use these.
Sauces, hamburger, and all sorts of other things.
The Nesco American Harvest Fruit Roll Sheets are a good accessory item for your dehydrator.
I was pleased to find that they fit my FD-35 Nesco Deydrator, too.
Haven't used them yet but I am sure they are perfect!.
I got my dehydrator with the intention of making a lot of fruit rolls.
When it only came with 2, I was a little disappointed, so I ordered these.
I got two, and can now make 6 trays of fruit rolls at a time!.
You must have these if you buy a dehydrator.
Besure to buy when you buy your dehydrator because you will save alot ofmoney than if you buy them individually.
No spray needed, just put your fruit leather stuff in and come back later.
I got these so I can make &#34;hamburger rocks&#34;, and not have to store the meat in my freezer.
Now I can store it for a few years in mason jars with an oxygen absorber, and free up space.
Keeps the smaller pieces from falling through conventional grates.
This is a useful and necessary addition to the Nesco dehydrator...which btw is one of the best investments I've made in awhile.
The food I'll have on the trail this summer is going to be so much better than that expensive camp crap from the outdoors store.
If you have a dehydrator then you better be making some fruit leather.
Imagine all the fruit leather goodness we can make!.
I don't use these very frequently, but they do come in handy with purees.
These work well for other types of foods, in terms of cleanup.
Like the clean-a-screens, 12 of these fit in my sink at one time, versus 4 of the dehydrator trays.
For drying fruits and such, these sometimes make for easier cleanup than the trays/clean-a-screens.
These things are great for making applesauce fruit rollups.
I've also done blended strawberries, which are quite tart without added sugar, and banana+nutella ones which took forever but were very very very good.
I love my dehydrator and these sheets make clean up so much easier.
I can make a huge batch of fruit roll ups that are sweetener free (although plenty sweet naturally) and free of harmful dyes and additives.
Your children will love them - heck, I love them and I'm 24!.
You start with a puree of fruit (like applesauce, peach, pear, apricot, or mixed fruits.) These sheets fit in the Nesco American Harvest dehydrator.
Great for raspberries, blueberries and strawberries, if you have a lot of them.
You can mix berries with apple or peach to stretch them a bit and make some nice varieties of fruit leather.
Blech.)You can also make RAW CRACKERS from vegetable puree plus flax seed using these sheets, which is what I do.
It will pull off like fruit leather, and you can cut them up into triangles.
We are in Florida for three months and the farmers markets are wonderful.
I purchased a dehydrater..from Amazon but needed some trays for fruit leathers.
The company had them but Amazon was cheaper and with prime in a blink of an eye it was delivered.
I have used them every day since I got them.
I works better if you very lightly grease them then put the fruit sauce on them.
I wish these trays didn't have a hole so it was easier to spread the fruit around.
I wound up ordering enough of these to match every tray, all for a &#34;just in case&#34; situation.
And that situation has arisen with the candy making from fruit activity I've embraced.
The final product that needs drying drips syrup as it dries and having these trays makes clean-up a breeze.Work fine for roll ups, too.
Not much I can say except that it fits perfectly in my dehydrator.
It is simple to insert, very easy to clean, and my treats come out perfectly.
I love these I have used them with oranges and pepper rings.
I can not wait to do my own fruit roll ups at home,.
It is healthier and the fruit roll are MUCH better then what you can buy at the store.
Tried these out as soon as they arrived, and it was super easy to make a fruit paste to dry.
I just blended up some pears and added a bit of appe sauce and poured it into the trays.
The end result tasted pretty good (though I may have dried them just a tad too much).
My 3 year old son loves to eat his fruit roll up &#34;candy&#34; - and I love that he thinks it is candy!.
These are great for making leathers in my dehydrator.
They work well and they are very easy to clean.
I've used them for strawberry leather and they didn't even stain!.
But the price seems high for a piece of plastic.
Also am not sure if it's BPA free or not.
I bought a set of these to make fruit rolls for hiking.
The Scouts in my troop are always impressed with them (if I bring enough to share).
They work great, and are very easy to use.
Simply spray them with Pam and pour your fruit mixture on them.
Put them in the dehydrator and turn it on.
For the fruit mixture, I usually use unsweetened applesauce (from big Costco jars) mixed with jam or jelly.
I once tried to make fruit rolls on waxed paper, instead of buying these.
Don't do that, because the waxed paper will become permanently bonded to the fuit.
A friend of mine uses them to dry liquidy foods for camping, such as home made stew and spaghetti sauce.
I use them to dry applesauce, home make stew, etc.
I use one on the bottom rack as a drip tray when I am dehydrating high moisture foods like pears or apples.
This saves a lot of cleanup.The only problem with them is staining.
Drying tomato products will turn the sheets pink.
Once I make coconut milk I put the pulp on this sheet for drying so I can make coconut flour.
What can I say?  This is just a plastic tray for holding stuff like applesauce that can be dried into fruit leather.
They fit properly and we have no problems with them.
Much better price than from the local hardware store.
I bought my dehydrator at wal mart, it is the model 39.
I am happy to say these and the clean a screen fit mine just right.
I haven't used them much,because at this time of the yr most of the fruit has already gone.
Looking forward to next yr so I can start out using these screens and rollups.
Love to carry applesauce that doesn't need a spoon in the car for traveling.
Makes great snacks of anything that would normally be a real mess to handle with just your fingers.
These work great! My daughter takes her lunch every day.
She wanted fruit rollup that were all fruit.She loves them.
These work so well and easily with my dehydrator.
I know exactly what is in them, because I make them in my blender with fresh fruit combinations.
Just pour the pulp onto these sheets on the dehydrator trays, and fruit roll ups are ready in less than 24 hours.
Just roll them up and store in zip lock baggies.
I wanted to create some pumpkin power from pumpkin pulp.
Don't really use this, but thought I would, but they seem to be very handy and good quality.
I will probably use them in the future.
I use these for making fruit leathers in my open country 700W dehydrator that I got from REI this year.
cant wait to use it all the reviews look great so excited to start drying fruit and veggies thank you.
When you set up the drier, just add a couple.
Yes, it adds time to the drying process, but do it.
Ordered 2 sets to go with new Nesco dehydrator ordered and they are wonderful.
Able to increase drying area without buying a second unit.
These all fit snugly together and clean up was super easy.
I originally bought my dehydrator in 1990 and it is still going strong.
As the years have went by I've added trays and this year will be no different.
This is a wonderful product and I'd tell anyone that it is well worth the money.
I'm down to where the dehydrator has cost me dollars per year.
They fit my machine perfectly, great condition, and I have used them several times already this week.
Just help suit with a load when I fill my unit up.
I love these and plan on ordering several more sets of trays!  They have been easy to clean and fit tight!.
But on the whole extra trays are very handy.
We ordered two sets of these and they let us dry a bunch more stuff all at once.
I knew right off that four trays in the  Nesco FD-1040 1000-watt Gardenmaster Food Dehydrator that I bought would not be enough.
Love that these trays are so easy to clean!.
These are exactly like the ones I got with the main unit.
They do bend a bit in the middle if you puch, but they don't under the weight of food.
If you already own the wonderful Nesco food dehydrator, then this is your next logical and sensible purchase.
You might as well be able to produce more of your favorite dried food in one process.
For me, I like to make a lot of beef jerky at once.
The added trays make it possible to dry four pounds of ground sirloin in five hours.
The trays are exact duplicates of what you are now using.
Just be certain of your Nesco's model number pryor to ordering this useful addition to you machine.
The 4 trays that come with it are a joke.
Got this add-a-tray and was able to do almost 7 pounds of venison jerky in 7 hours.
Reasonably priced trays which expand your drying capabilities for your Nesco Gardenmaster food dehydrator.
I bought these through Amazon's 4 for 3 pricing deal which made the individual trays a bargain price.
The quality is what you have come to expect from the Nesco brand name.
Only four of these Nesco American Harvest Trays came with my Nesco FD1020 Gardenmaster Dehydrator.
I was only able to make 1.5 pounds of beef jerky strips with four trays.
Since my dehydrator can dry 20 trays of food, I knew I had to buy more.
If you only need two of these, by all means get it from Amazon.
However, if you need a dozen to increase your dehydrator's capacity (like I did when I first bought my FD1020), check out Sears online.
You can get a 12-pack for under ninety dollars.
That's about seven dollars and fifty cents each tray.
You'll be a lot happier with your dehydrator's capacity!.
Recommended if you get the dehydrator - get a couple of extras of these!.
Fit's great in my Garden Master and makes it so on the weekends I can just run one batch instead of two.
This was the cheapest I could find them without buying in bulk.
These are a lot easier to clean then the other style we have.
The food doesn't get stuck in it, like it does with the others I have.
They fit well and work exactly as the originals.
However, they are not cheap for what looks like 50 cents wrth of plastic.
These trays are a must have if you plan to do a lot of dehydrating.
Originally my dehydrator only came with 4 and that is definitely not enough if you do a lot of dehydrating.
I do think they should make the holes smaller.
They are quite large and makes it difficult to put certain things on without it falling through.
They fit my  American harvest dehydrator just as good as the original one.
I like them, in fact they are exactly the same as the original trays.
The new Nesco dehydrator trays are more lightweight than the older type.
I got 6 additional trays at the beginning of November and it seems to add little additional drying time.
further addition to the dehydrator I purchased to dry foods and fruits...these allowed me to work with different types of food in the dryer.
They are a great add to the unit especially since you will want to go crazy making so many things.
I bought this to have extra trays when I'm dehydrating.
This provided the trays I needed at a good price.
I purchased them along with the dehydrator, and we have used all of them to make the jerky.
6 trays and it still get everything dry no problems without a lot of added time.
so excited &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; about using my food dehydrator &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; healthy healthy yummy food is on the way&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; cool thank you.
They fit my machine and trays perfectly, I have used them two times already this week.
This is one of the best investments I ever did.
I love making Jerky and clean up had always been a task and a half.
I use these and it is now a breeze!  Love em.
I recently bought my first Nesco dehydrator and went about drying everything I could find (laughing).
Since I have a small herb garden on my patio, I began with basil, thyme, sage, etc.
These wonderful mesh sheets kept those small items perfectly while drying.
Nothing fell through the mesh or the tray.
Since I cut the basil leaves either in half or thirds to help dry, I had small pieces.
I generally use a soft, round brush to hand wash things and it is perfect for these.
Nothing remains stuck in the mesh at all.
Just last week, I dried delicious Ranier cherries to rehydrate and add to smoothies in the winter.
I don't want to be unprepared for whatever I dry.
These are very nice, and again, so very easy to keep clean.
Thus far, they're very durable, and I use them a lot.
All it takes is a soft plastic brush and hot soapy water and they clean up very easily.
If you're serious about dehydrating, you really need these!.
These sheets are nearly 2 inches smaller in diameter than the Clean-a-Screen sheet that came with my dehydrator.
The drawback is that not as much food can be dehydrated on each tray.
I allowed larger pieces of food to extend beyond the edges of the Clean-a-Screen.
The screens make sticky food much easier to remove from the dehydrator racks and the screens clean easily in the dishwasher.
Bought these to replace my misplaced old ones.
These are sturdier than the old.Two days after receiving these, I found the old ones.
These will come in handy for dehydrating around this prepper's house.
I purchased the Clean-a-Screen to supplement the one that came with the dehydrator.
They are very fragile and the smaller pieces fall to the bottom of the machine creating a mess.
Plus the olive oil and vinegar mixture cause the leaves to stick.
Easy clean up and also stops the smaller pieces from falling thru.
I recommend these for anyone with an issue of sticking fruits and veggies.
They work better than the original screens that came with the dehydrator.
I actually have the American Harvest that is square and expanded to 5 trays.
It came with one mesh dehydrator screen and I have scoured the internet to find additional screen to buy...THEY DON'T SEEM TO EXIST.
Anyways, I bought these instead and they work fine.
Just can't put food on the corners of the trays.
I wanted more screens for drying herbs so they would quit falling through.
These are great and do exactly as described.
Not much to say on these really - they are what they say they are and work as designed.
Needed these for my dehydrater for smaller fruits so they don't fall through the racks.
They work really good and the fruit and veggies don't stick to it making it super easy to take the food off of them.
I throw them in the dishwasher (top rack) to clean and have used them 20+ times already without any problems.
For those sticky fruits and vegetables this is a must have product.
They peel right off and makes your life a little easier.
They screen can be washed quickly in a big sink or the dishwasher and dryed fruit peals off them quickly.
The screens are flexible and seem to be indestructable.
I now have screens for all my trays and use them even if I am drying vegetables.
I bought this to help with my new hobby of dehydrating food.
I used this for smaller fruit that might fall between the slats of the regular tray.
Cleaning was super easy, and the fruit peeled right off without much of a fight.
These trays are quite sturdy and I expect them to last very well.
I have made fruit leather on them and tomato leather, too, as well as using them for drying celery.
Celery shrivels up so much that any mesh is too large to contain it, so they are a must to use when dehydrating it.
They'd also be perfect for small herbs or flowers.
They are easy to clean and can be washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.
These sheets work great for making fruit roll-ups because the keep the fruit contained well and are flexible for removal and clean up.
Fit my machine just right and have already used them several time this week.
I did not realize my Dehydrator would come with these already so I ordered extras.
I'm still glad I spent the extra money.
While we are waiting for the jerky slices to marinade, we are merrily dehydrating mass amount of fruit rolls for flavor testing.
makes for easier clean up and drying fuit doen't slip between cracks with liner but pricey liners.
These are solid sheets so no fruit mixture drips between the holes.
I only wish they were square and not roll to maximize space useage.
Another fine Nesco product for your food dehydrator! I use these to make my homemade, dehydrated granola bars.
They're a great value for the money and with Amazon Prime, it's even a better deal because the shipping was free, to boot.
I bought a dehydrator so that I can make food for backpacking trips.
First I bought some extra trays, then I bought some clean-a-screens for the trays, and finally I bought these for the wet stuff.
They are easy to clean and are big enough for the job at hand.
It is so nice having the right tool for the job, and if you want the right tool for roll-ups, don't look any farther.
I used them to make fruit roll ups in my dehydrator.
I followed someones suggestion to first spray with cooking spray then pour on the applesauce.
I am happy they have the lip to keep from spill overs.
There are times when I want to make a fruit leather or other dried wet runny food.
I purchased the Nesco Fruit Roll-Up sheet for just that purpose and is now a well used, well loved part of my dehydrating supplies.
Useful for dehydrating vegetable purees as well as fruit.
Even though these are round, they fit perfectly inside my squareNesco FD-80A Square-Shaped Dehydrator Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging.
I primarily dehydrate food that is either small (i.e.
Only one of these Nesco American Harvest Fruit Roll-Up Sheets came with my Nesco FD1020 Gardenmaster Dehydrator.
I find these sheets to be very useful.
They can be used to dry fruit pureed to create your own tasty fruit roll-ups or other liquidy products (i.e.
One can also be placed on the bottom rack to catch any drippings that might fall to the bottom of your dehydrator.
If you only need two of these, by all means get it from Amazon.
However, if you need a dozen to increase your dehydrator's capacity (like I did when I first bought my FD1020), check out Sears online.
You can get a 12-pack for under thirty-six dollars.
Only advice is make them thicker on the outside and thinner in the middle.
A necessity if you are dehydrating anything that has a loose consistency, such as raw breads, raw crackers, kale chips (with lots of sauce), etc.
I bought two packs of two-ea and use them in my new 14"  square Nesco dehydrator.
A short spray with kitchen spray and nothing sticks and they clean up easily.
Great accessory to dry soups, stews, pasta for backpacking/camping food.
Fruit roll-ups are a healthy snack and can be made with a variety of fruits.
The only way to make a perfect fruit roll-up is to have these.
But a little pricey if you ask me.
The new "fruit roll-up" sheets are better than the old version.
They are thicker, more flexible, and the hole in the center is wide enough to get them off trays easily.
I dry lots of tomato sauce every summer and use these sheets 3-4 times a week.
Tomatoes do stain them, but except for turning orange they seem to be like new after more than 30 uses.
Each sheet holds about 3 cups of liquid.
It did just want it was intended to do.
Great product for the money - will be used quite often.
If you are going to make fruit leather then this is a must.
I had to get additional since I only had two and I needed four all together.
Nesco SLD-2-6 Fruit Roll-Up Sheets are very easy to use and even easier to clean! I wouldn't recommend putting them in the dishwasher though.
They are very thin and will probably warp (or melt).
I gave it four stars because I thought they were a bit pricey, no matter where you buy them.
Nesco SLD-2 Fruit Roll-Up Sheet fit the square dehydrator well.
This is good for dehydrate the liquid stuff.
I had no idea that lean hamburger could be used for making jerky.
This Jerky Works Kit is amazing - makes it so easy!.
Easy to use, and more importantly to clean after using same.
The process is simple ground meat of your choice, spice and cure.
Load into gun and choose between two shapes flat or round.
Dependent upon your food dehydrator you can have jerky in a matter of hours.
Replacement spices and cures can be found at most larger department/retail  stores.
I use mine often and it is certainly a lot better than doing it by hand.
It give consistent results which is a must for good results in your dehydrator.
The included seasoning packets make great tasting jerky.
I wish it held a larger amount of meat though.
For a pound of meat, you will have to reload about 3 times.
I am a casual user of the food dehydrator, mainly for beef jerky.
I had always used thin cut steak and marinated it for a day or two and then dehydrated.
Well, I received a Nesco dehydrator for christmas which had jerky spice packets included with it.
Reviewing how these packets worked, i saw that it called for ground meat, a new concept for me.
Well, I broke down and got this item and mixed up a small batch, and I am never going back to the steak.
It took a while for me to perfect which flavors to use, but this is as close to store bought jerky you can get.
I have a Nesco dehydrator (see my other review nesco FD-60), and 3 lbs ground beef fill all the trays with the flat jerky strips.
I make the flat strips, but this kit comes with the capability to make beef sticks as well, which are awesome as well.
Try this jerky fans, you will not be disappointed.
I installed two of these, one in each bathroom.
I debated about these or an electronic timer, but opted for this one because of the simplicity.
They're nice looking, were easy to install, and both have been working great for about a month now.
You will see reviews about people getting something that was not an intermatic timer.
The unit I received was an intermatic timer.
Usually when you see ships and sold by Amazon, you get what you are supposed to get.
A good little timer...a bit on the loud side.
I used mine in conjunction with a infrared heat lamp I installed in my bathroom.
Just purchased two of these at a harware store closing in Calexico, Ca.
Installed one of them and it works well.
Keeps good time and Now I dont have to worry about if I turned off my coffee pot or toaster oven.
After 20 years we had to replace some of these timers in our house.
If this set last that long too I will be a happy camper.
These are very quite (at the low setting) compared to other fans and move SO much air.
Even with air-conditioning on those extra-hot days, this fan really moves the air around.
Let me start off by saying I LOVE this fan.
On low it moves more air than any other box fan or stand fan that I have ever had.
Also I purchased these fans off of Walmart.com and saved $9 and only paid 97cent shipping.
There is a version of this fan with a remote but I think having remotes for the tv and dvd player is bad enough.
Seriously....I don't know why I don't burst into flames sometimes and I'm not talking about hot flashes.
This literally feels like my blood is almost boiling.
It's a LIFE SAVER! It moves HUGE amounts of air.
I especially love it when I'm slaving over a hot stove cooking dinner.
My husband loves it because I'm not as crabby when I can cool off.Another wonderful thing about it is that it's pretty portable.
It's got a nice handle so I can move it from room to room easily and I've even taken it with me to the gym.
(26 smackers at a place that offers free site to store shipping).
In a month or two, if this one is still ship shape then I'm almost positive I'll get another.
Just got this at great price of $20 on sale at RiteAide.
Love it already! Other reviewers seem not to have indicated how far from themselves they set the fan before indicating noise level.
I have it running on low at 4-5' away and can definitely hear it.
This fan won't fall over as easily either and doesn't require putting feet or other parts on it.
Like this fan so much that I am getting another one for upstairs.
Awesome!  I bought this set about 5 years ago & it's held up very well, still looks brand new.
It goes with practically any type of table you could ever set, casual to formal.
It's a classic design that won't ever go out of style, at least in my book.
I grew up with Oneida Colonial Boston silverware.
When I was setting up my own house I found there were a myriad of choices.
Yet, I kept coming back to Oneida and this pattern in particular.
When we moved into our new house we decided to update our furnishings and chose a decidedly casual contemporary look.
I've never had these bend, warp or rust (of course this is with normal use).
I am not a fussy/ornate type of person.
I've looked at "special occasion" flatware and it's all too scrolled, flowery or busy for me.For me, the Oneida Colonial Silverware is where it's at.
I never get sick of looking at the pattern and overall I just love 'em.
We started our set of Oneida Independence, which is interchangeable with Colonial Boston, 25 years ago and have added to it since.
This stuff still looks amazing, doesn't bend, doesn't scratch, doesn't rust, and holds its satin finish beautifully.
No matter - it's all still in great shape.
Just two nights ago my husband commented on how well this flatware has held up and how much we still like its simple design.
All credit to me, thank you very much!.
A bit large for its practicality on the dining room table.
I've had mine for a couple of yours.
The photo beautifies the plastic exterior to a ceramic illusion.
Nevertheless, if you must have gravy on your table once a year, go with this option instead of the fancy open gravy boats.
I bought one of these for thanksgiving gravy.
Too bad!  This is a GREAT product!  I NEED MORE!.
The crystal saver is fine and does exactly what it is advertised to do........takes a little work and persistance but does the job.
This thing easily took the sharp edges off my chipped crystal and glass.
However, the repairs are not really noticeable as they are small.
Try to keep the file from touching anywhere except the nick so that you don't create unnecessary marks on your glassware.
Used it as soon as it arrived to do away with a chip on my glass pitcher.
Has instructions and easy to use, patience is key to get desired results.
I've salvaged at least 3 glasses since the purchase, so I believe its paid for itself already.
We have a lot of crystal decanters and glassware.
If you need to file down chipped crystal - this is the only tool I can recommend.
My mom had purchased one of these years ago for a friend who had a chipped piece of crystal.
Unfortunately, she did not purchase one for herself and had been unable to find one.
She was so pleased when I gave her this one.
It works well and is made well, at a very reasonable price.
She has been very satisfied with the performance of this item and recommends it to others.
My wife was upset to find that two of the new drinking glasses we bought got chipped somehow.
I bought the DMT Crystal Saver and she used it to smooth the edge.
She reported that it was quick, easy, and worked very well.
They were inexpensive, but why replace them? This worked like a charm.
We used to have one of these files but after moving could not find it.
So, of course, once we bought a new one, we found the old one.
Have several good sharpening systems for kitchen knives and pocket collection ($100++ ea).
Perhaps it will smooth out when the knotch edges wear a little.
Quality is good but the fine is pretty coarse in my opinion.
I ordinarily don't sharpen serrated edges as I don't own any blades with serrated edges, I prefer plain edges.
It conforms to the semi-circular or half-moon design.
The taper of the rod permits different size cuts to be addressed.Fortunately, most serrated edges don't require much.
However, it does not get in the way of using the tool.
My only reason for giving it four stars is that I feel it should be a little less expensive.
At ~$25 per sharpener, it makes buying the whole set a rather expensive proposition.
The DMT Fine Diamond Serrated Knife Sharpener is useful in the right hands.
It comes packaged with instructions on how to sharpen serrated blades.
It does have a lightweight feel, but this should not be taken for flimsy.
DMT sharpeners are among the best hand-held sharpeners out there.
This particular model is for sharpening serrated knives.
It was used on two large bread knives that were probably never sharpened, and made them super sharp and easier to work with.
Great for steak knives too! Remember: although it seems illogical, the sharper the knife, the safer it is to use.
If DMT's don't work for you, you are probably using them wrong.
I am still learning the technique to restore a sharp edge to my serrated knives.
not sure I have mastered it yet but it may take more strokes or more practice.
I've had this thing for many years now.
When it comes to pocket knives, I can sharpen them up pretty good with a dual composite stone.
I also have a longer steel for the kitchen knives which I utilize to hone prior to each use.
If the knife is of good quality, I'll take it in for professional sharpening.
There is a big difference between sharpening and honing.
Honing takes that edges imperfections out or realigns the folded over or flat spots.
My opinion, knives banging against each other in a drawer messes them up.
In the past I used a fine diamond stone to get a respectable edge on my knives.
As for as my collection of EDC, hunting and tactical this stone can get these knives dangerously sharp.
Normally I'll use it wet to finish sharpening a knife.
This stone will not get you same results, but will get you close.
I already own theDMT FWF  Diafold Diamond Whetstone Sharpener Finewhich is a great place to start with a very dull knife.
But it's a little course for everyday sharpening.
I suppose you could screw it to a workbench, but I don't have the space for that in my shop area.
It's easier to use this larger block even if you have to hold it down at one end to the counter while honing.
It has the aspects of a Japanese wet stone but it is diamond impregnated and very durable.
Great for keeping a sharp edge but not for heavy shapening.
When used regularly my pocket knife stays razor sharp.
This is the finer grit stone, not suitable for making an edge on a rough blade, but rather polishing a blade that lost it's sharpness.
It would take you a very long time to smooth out a rough blade with this.Great stone, won't wear away, works excellently.
This is the SAME Extra Fine whetstone from DMT as the  W6E except it has a Plastic bpox in lieu of wood for $17 less.
Nothing can match it's Excellence in final sharpening of a fine knife to a razor edge.DMT W6EP 6-Inch Diamond Tabletop Whetstone, Extra Fine Grit.
Very well constructed easy to handle and tried it on my dull knives worked perfectly this is a steal at that price.
I needed to replace my standard 2 sided whetstone - it was no longer flat.
Since I use diamond cutting tools for cutting stone, I couldn't resist trying this.Compared to a regular whetstone, this has a couple of advantages.
The rubber feet make it easy to sharpen without holding it - a real plus after a glass of wine or two.
The non-porous surface means you can rinse it, shake it, and put it right back in the drawer.
The diamond abrasives put an edge on quickly and easily.I'm not tossing my old whetstone.
The coarse side will come in handy for a damaged or badly dulled blade.The secret to sharp knives is to not let them get dull.
I give my kitchen knives a few swipes almost every time I put them away.
This stone makes that even easier to do.
I'd say that's true, if your Travis Bickle.
I think I have finally found a sharpening strategy that works.
I bought 3 of these, coarse, medium and fine.
After using these, I put my knife on a sharpening steel to finish them off.
Razor sharp now.I think this sharpener (fine) couples with a japanese stone (3000+ grit) would be the perfect combo.
I am a collecter and do buy some used knifes from time to time for my personal collection and dress them with this stone.
I have owned an array of knife sharpeners, cheap and expensive.
Some results were good, some poor and others just ok.
However after watching a few videos demonstrating this stone and sharpening technique, I said to myself I can do that.
I ordered this stone and when it arrived I practiced on some old pocket knives with fantastic results.
My hands would actually shake when I attempted to try.
Well I practiced some more on my friends knives and after receiving so many compliments I mustered up the courage to go ahead.
It is a fast easily learned no mess way to keep your knives so sharp you will look forward to using them.
Despite this is called a "fine" grit stone, it is plenty aggressive for a typical kitchen knife.
The DMT diamond stones need a small amount of water during sharpening.
It is to help prevent metal fines from sticking to the sharpening surface.
In my opinion, water lubricant stones are superior to oil assisted stones for two reasons.
First, it is easy to apply water and to clean up afterward.
Second, water is less slippy than oil and therefore it is safer to sharpen a knife with wet hands than oiled hands.
DMT makes interrupted surface and continuous surface diamond stones.
This allows greater sharpening performance by reducing the frequency of washing and removing the metal fines from the surface.
However, if your tools have very small blades, then they will get caught in the recessed area.
You will need a continuous surface diamond stone for these small blade tools.
I have upload a closeup customer picture of the diamond stone.
The stone is 6" X 2", adequate for most kitchen knives, though a wider one would be nicer.
The receded red dot areas are 1/8" in diameter.
I find this diamond stone to be very versatile.
It cut fast and uniform, and yet gives you full control.
The DMT grinding surface is extremely flat, so I also use it to flatten my Japanese water stones.
If you have never used a diamond stone, then you will be surprised how fast this stone can cut/grind.
I have an aluminum oxide oil stone and I have to push my knives downward at the stone to sharpen them.
Whereas I simply slide my knives back and forth on this diamond stone.
This saves time, energy and improve sharpening results.
I put it on this diamond stone and it managed to grind out the chipped area.
I then finished it on my 1000 and 6000 grit water stones.
The extra coarse stone makes reprofiling an knife edge/bevel very easy.
I have since bought Naniwa Super waterstones for replacement.
Nevertheless, I am still using the DMT diamond stone and it is part of my setup.
I have nothng but PRAISE for this product.
This is the gold standard for blade sharpening.
Product arrived on schedule and in good condition.
I have used it to sharpen knives, planes and scrapers.
It has done a great job on everything put on it.
Hands down, the absolute best one I've ever used.
Made homemade buttermilk pancakes yesterday, and it was the first time I didn't have an ounce of trouble flipping them in the pan.
The end of the turner is very tapered in order to easily get up under your burgers, pancakes etc.
This spatula is both flexible enough for getting under delicate fish and strong enough for picking up heavier items.
I had ordered the larger version of this product and loved it.
It was highly recommended by The Pioneer Woman as one of her favorite utensils.
The larger one works great with her big family and large cast iron skillet.
I wanted the smaller one for the meals for two.
Love them both! Quality and made in USA!.
It washes up wonderfully in the dishwasher and is made in the USA by a reputable manufacturer.
I also own a similar turner by Wusthof that I frequently use, so much so that I often find it in with the dirty dishes.
It is for this reason that I decided to purchase another turner and decided to give this made in the USA version a go.
They are both are of same guage, high quality steel with similiar handles, size and weight.
If you cook with stainless or cast iron, this is a MUST have.
I flip eggs with ease and no broken yolks.
Just buy I, you will not regret it.
however, an earlier reviewer reported using it on a nonstick pan without any problems.
my teflon-challenged husband used it on my favorite nonstick skillet and turned it into a scratched up, unsalvageable mess.
This is a great turner for lots of things.
Actually I don't cook fish at all, but this is a very useful product.
Often I use it instead of a whisk to mix batters for pancakes, etc.
One of the TV chefs said this was one of the three most important kitchen tools, which it how I started using these.
LOVE LOVE that this product is made in the USA.
I  never splurge on turners and I know I will have this one for long time well made and useful.
I bought this slotted turner to use in my AlClad pans and even my very picky co-cook husband likes it.
It feels like quality in your hand!  So worth the money as I think it will see years and years of use.
This is the best spatual I've  ever had! I use it for everything.
it is light weight yet very sturdy and the quality is great! I will order another of these soon.
Instead of throwing money away by buying cheaper spatulas, I splurged on this one.
Of course once you own it you can use it to flip whatever you see fit.
It is very sturdy, well built, and looks like it will out-last me.
I don't expect this LamsonSharp turner to hold up over time.
Pity since it's so expensive compared to others in the same category.
This is definitely a professional tool meant to last a lifetime.
From the one piece construction to the perfect combination of flex and durability, this is my goto &#34;lifter&#34; for anything that goes into a pan.
It's a beautiful piece of cookware as well - guests gasp whenever I whip this out !.
I use this item with most of my pots and pans and even often when I bar-b-que...it gives you a sense of control.
Unfortunately, it is not useful for non-stick/teflon pans.
Otherwise, it is sturdy, good quality and feels comfortable in the hand.
And it works very well for cutting a home made pizza.
It also does a good job at chopping salads, cutting sandwiches in half, and dicing stuff up.
Did I mention it was sharp? It came sharp enough to slice through thin paper like butter and really holds an edge.
I only wish it were a bit bigger, I almost always need two cuts to cut a pizza.
I love that it doesn't destroy the pizza when you cut it.
I'd love to give these out as gifts.
I bought this after tiring of trying to slice home made pizzas in the pan, after cooling somewhat.
A large Knife was usually a pain to cut with.
I was concerned that this pizza knife might not be quite long enough for my homemade pizzas, which I bake on 14" pizza stones.
But it's a little more difficult to reach 14" needed than with a longer knife.
(You have to go for the FULL rocking action to reach 14".)Yet for the huge savings over most 20" rocking pizza knives--I'm happy.
If I get tired of the "full rocking," I can always make my pizzas a tad smaller!.
Our family would probably not be classified as true pizza aficionados thus I never gave a thought to a &quot;professional&quot; pizza cutter.
Who knows, we may even eat pizza more often.
Well made in the USA and using it is so much more satisfying than a pizza wheel.
Works SO much better than a &#34;wheeled&#34; pizza cutter, as it doesn't take all the cheesy goodness with it when you cut.
It takes up more space, but it's a far superior design.
I love this item sooooo much!  It has yet to disappoint.
It came early, works well and right for the price!.
I've always wanted a pizza slicer like the ones you see used in pizza parlors.
Our old wheel type cutter broke and I was looking for a replacement.
I have used other lamsonsharp products in the past and always found them to be well made reliable products.
We would never go back to the old wheel cutter.
This unit, while not as small as a wheel cutter, cuts pizza and sandwiches like a knife thru soft butter.
It's also much easier to clean in my opinion.
One complaint I have is that it is just a little to small for anything over a 12" pizza really.
For a softer crust, the knife edge is sharp enough for clean cuts.
This gets a lot of use in the kitchen.
I worked at a Pizza Hut in college, and we used this type of pizza cutter.
It was so much easier to use than the traditional rolling cutters.
I've always wondered why these were not found in stores.
Anyway, I finally have this one, and it works GREAT.
Nice clean cuts, and as someone has said, no pulling the  toppings off while ROLLING a wheel cutter.
It still works great for them (with 2 cuts), but I got spoiled working in that pizza joint cutting every size pizza with one cut.
But I'm definately happy enough with this to buy again as gifts.
It is superior to the round cutters we used on frozen pizza's.
We are now trying to make fresh pizza on a stone.
although I still prefer using my round roller type pizza cutter.
This ones still a little awkward for me.
I make a lot of pizza's and sometimes this is not large enough.
IT IS A LITTLE BIG FOR MY HANDS, BUT IT WORKS.
The comfort grip cookie cutters are the only cutters I buy.
Makes a huge difference when cutting the cookie -- doesn't hurt your hand or fingers.
Used with a cookie recipe that called for a 1/4&#34; roll out cookie.
Easy to cut and design held up well.
After applying a smooth frosting to the cookie I dusted them with crystal sanding sugar and they looked wonderful!.
I bought this cut sandwiches for halloween party.
It is the perfect size for this use.
I purchased this cookie cutter for my son's upcoming ghost birthday themed party.
I actually want to use it to make ghost shaped peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Well, when it arrived it was a lot larger than I imagined!  It would make a nice large cookie.
I will have to use large bread slices to cut from.
Anyway, it's a cute shape, not a scary ghost shape but fun with lots of room for decorating possibilities.
Wilton always has good quality and the larger size works nice for puffy sugar cookies.
I liked my old one so much in fact that I didn't want any other kind when I decided to get a new one.
It is well made, does what it's supposed to  and looks good too.
Being as busy as I am, I need a mug that I don't have to worry about.
It insulates very well (though not quite as well as Nissan's Backpack Bottle), keeping coffee warm for a few hours no problem.
The handle is comfortable and easy to use.
It fits in my car's cupholders.However, the lid is, in my opinion, simply a poor design.
I purchased this coffee mug based on the reviews here at Amazon, and so far have been pleased.
The best part about the lid is that there are no crevices or little openings to harbor residue from coffee with milk or cream.
It is also totally spill-proof, another criteria for this busy mom and teacher.
It has been knocked over several times on my desk at school, without spilling a drop.
The only way to know is to either try screwing it open or shut, or to attempt to take a drink.
It keeps my drink hot and is leak proof.
I am able to add sweetner while tea is steeping and then turn it upside down without spillage.
I bought a second one to have on hand just in case they change the product.
My son told me about this mug and he can't say enough good things about it.
This is the only leak proof mug I have ever seen.
New cup does not have a thumb latch which I really miss, however, the coffee cup, like all Nissan-Thermos products is very well manufactured.
I use this cup in a Honda Odyssey and it fits the cup holder with no problems.
New cup retains heat very well (unlike other coffee cups made by other brands) and is leak proof if the top is properly screwed down.
If you like your coffee to stay hot - this is the cup to get.
After reading numerous review, this one sounded like the best one.
As soon as he received it he did the spill test.
He closed up the lid, turned it upside down and shook it.
You have to use your finger tips to loosen it which is usually too difficult to do with one hand.
But none of them go in the dishwasher.
Best mug for holding heat & thermos tight when the top is screwed down.
An extraordinarily efficient travel mug, purchased as a gift for my wife.
She's able to put it, full of liquid, in her briefcase, with the top snug, without any fear of spills.
And it does a great job of keeping your coffee warm - no, hot - for an extended period.
And it does an equally terrific job of keeping cool liquids cool.
It easily keeps ice cubes from melting for 6-7 hours or more, even in the summer.Great, highly recommended product.
Perfect thermos for hot coffee, keeps warm for quite a while.
This was a gift for my husband and he's very happy with it.
one inch slot in the top portion of the stopper and pry the two black pieces apart.
Then I remove the o-ring, swish all three parts in hot soapy water, rinse them thoroughly, dry them and put all three parts back together.
Only takes a few minutes to come up with an uber clean stopper.This order constitutes my second order for a great Thermos.
I ordered my first Thermos a couple years ago and have used it for juice or coffee as part of my a.m.
Because the item has proven to be perfect for my needs, I am ordering this second Thermos.
I also like how the top of the mug is shaped.
I bought myself one awhile ago looking just for a coffee mug that wouldn't leak.
Which is usually a major problem with coffee mugs.
When I started using this I realized I got more than my moneys worth for it.
If I could, I would buy everyone I know one of these.
I no longer use my coffee cups I just use this mug.
If you aren't sure whether you should buy it or not, do it.
The Nissan Thermos 14-ounce leak-proof insulated travel mug is nearly ideal if you want to travel with coffee.
Leak proof was my primary objective in selecting this mug.
After extensive use, my experience is that the criteria have indeed been met...and the aforementioned collection has been unceremoniously dispatched to the trash.
Here's why:-- COFFEE STAYS HOT thanks to the stainless steel double wall construction with vacuum insulation.
This is THE FIRST container that has not baptized my carpet with its contents.
When I received our first one from Amazon, I was somewhat unimpressed with the styling compared to other travel mugs I have used--not any longer.
I like my coffee to be HOT - and by hot I mean, nearly-burn-my-tongue hot.
Once it gets lukewarm I stop drinking it.
And for that reason this mug is far and away the best mug I've used (believe me I've tried a lot of other ones).
I've owned 3 of them and am about to purchase my fourth.
Do not overfill, otherwise when you put the lid on liquid will get pushed up into the threads.
After the mug is filled, make sure the threads inside the mug are dry before screwing on the lid.
Baristas can be careless about this so you have to swipe the inside with a napkin after they fill it.
The lid should be screwed on tightly, but as other reviewers have pointed out, the seal will get tighter as the mug heats up.
It's still hot enough for me to drink until around 10am.
The opposite effect is also true: if you drink iced coffee your beverage stays super COLD for a long time.
I read somewhere (maybe the directions?) that you should fill the mug with hot water to "prime" it for your beverage.
I don't bother with that and it still works great.3) The base of the mug fits into standard cup holders.
I'm known to occasionally drop things, and despite that I've never broken one of these mugs.
When the mug is full and the cup is clipped to my messenger bag, it bangs uncomfortably on my leg or hits doorposts.
If you're like me and don't scrub it every time you wash it, you can never get every last bit off because it's caked on.
That means that when you present it to the barista they want to charge you for a medium beverage.
But really, it only fits a Starbuck's tall coffee (which is 12 oz).
I had to demonstrate by pouring the tall coffee into the mug and showing the barista.
But for consistently steaming hot coffee and a mug that doesn't leak, it's totally worth it!.
The mug is leakproof, the outside stays cool, and the beverage stays hot.
The clip comes separate, so you don't have to have it on the cup (I don't).
Very happy with it and will be getting one for my husband.
He saw someone else using this product and talked to him to find out if he was happy with his purchase.
He was so I surprised my hubby with this mug.
He uses it every day without the worry of spilling in the car or on his clothes.
no drips or spills; keeps ice overnight; fits in car cup holder.
good looking design, but WHY the key ring on handle?.
This is most likely the best coffee/travel mug out there.
I've used mostly stainless and plastic coffee mugs for the car.
The plastic ones with boiling coffee have the issue with chemicals leaking into your beverage.
The stainless ones without a handle get very hot.
Almost all of these have the issue where the lids snap on.
The design will fit in nearly all cup holders.
There is a very comfortable handle, however with the vacuum insulation you can poor boiling liquid inside and the outside remains cool.
The lid is a screw on that is leak proof.
If you sip, but screw the cap tight after each sip the time will be somewhere in the middle.
It totally depends on how a person wishes to use their mug.
As the contents of the mug goes lower the heat released and able to be retained also drops significantly.
Even better Amazon has this cup on a 4 for 3 promotion, so you get 1 free.
Buy one for yourself and keep a few around for gifts.
I wouldn't mind 16 oz, but overall it's great.
The times I've done that I've had to dig out my robogrip pliers to unscrew the lid.
Still worth it for perhaps the only truly spill proof ss travel mug out there.
No telling how many of them cheapy mugs I'd have paid for over that time.
I had an old Starbucks stainless mug for a long time.
I looked around on Amazon, and bought the Nissan 14oz Travel Tumbler.
BIG mistake! It leaked like a sieve, even worse than my old junky Starbucks mug.
It is beyond me how you can make something that leaks profusely, and call it a "travel" mug.
So, I returned it, and got these Leak-Proof mugs instead.Jackpot.I'm telling you, there are few words which convey how happy I am with this mug.
If you pour hot coffee into it straight-up, it will keep it hot for a few hours, which is good.
But personally, I follow the suggestion of the manufacturer, and boil water in the microwave first, then pour it into the mug.
I let it sit, sealed, for a little bit, then pour out the water and fill it with coffee.
This will keep coffee scalding (burn your mouth!) hot for about 2 hours.
It will keep it pleasantly warm for over 5 hours.
I'll gladly trade a little ease of opening for not having the thing spill all over the place.This thing is perfect.
We had initially purchased 2 of these a couple years ago and continued using our less than ideal other insulated mugs.
Finally got fed up with them leaking and ordered 4 more of these mugs.
We considered the Oxo mugs but reviews on Amazon turned us off due to numerous comments on inability to keep the top clean.
The Nissan mugs are easy to clean and really keep drinks hot or cold.
I bought two of these 2 or 3 years ago, and both still work perfectly.
Who should buy this mug?  Someone who loves their coffee and is on the go.
The o-ring is stretchable, take it off to clean it.
Also, the threaded lid is two pieces, remember to take it apart and clean inside weekly.
Also don't fill it past the marked line on the inside or you will squeeze some fluid up around the lid.
I will buy more of these if I ever lose mine, as they have held up well.
The double stainless vacuum wall keeps coffee hot, and the leak-proof lid is really leak-proof.
I carried this mug almost everyday for almost five years now, and no drips.
Nothing spoils fresh-roasted, fresh-brewed coffee more than plastic overtones.The construction is very durable.
This mug will take being dropped, kicked, and crammed into crevices.
I suspect I will eventually have to replace the o-ring on the lid but haven't had to yet.
This is a very fine stainless steel coffee mug.
It has a sturdy rubber handle with an optional clip.
The manufacturer's instructions advise against washing in a dish washer.
The lid forms a tight seal that in my experience has been absolutely leak-proof.
In fact, that's my only problem with this mug--the seal can be so tight that I can't open the mug at all.
Generally, this happens when there is a large difference between liquid temperature inside the mug and air temperature outside.
I once poured boiling water in the mug and took it on a long hike on a 5 degree F day.
When I tried to open the mug out on the trail, no amount of twisting with my fingers alone could loosen the lid.
In such situations, a pair of pliers is handy.
Being a coffee addict, I've owned many travel mugs.
The knockoffs don't keep coffe hot for even an hour.
For one thing, no matter how I bounce it around it NEVER leaks.
For another, it keeps my coffee hot all morning and drinkable warm well into the afternoon.
I've had it for over a year and it just keeps on keeping on.
Waiting for my next coupon so I can get a 2nd one.
The twisting top works great and has prevented numerous spills.
We have two of these mugs and use them at least 5 times a week for over 3 years now.
I should have thought and measured out how much 14 ounces is.
I thought this would be a bit larger.
It holds as much as an extra large coffee mug.
I really like the handle and the mug fits perfectly in the vehicle drink holders.
I haven't used the clip that comes with it.
The rubber grip around the middle comes off for washing.
I am not sure if the mug can go in the dishwasher...I'll have to read the reviews and description again.
So far, I've just washed it by hand.Overall, I couldn't be happier with this mug...unless it were bigger! ;o).
I originally had the tumbler version for nearly 20 years before the lid seal started to leak.
I chose this one because I wanted one with a handle and it is even better if that is possible.
I've been using this mug for about 5 years now and have found it to be the best travel mug available.It doesn't leak.
Since the lid screws on, rather than pops on, there's no chance that the lid will pop off.
I put this mug in my bag right next to my laptop without hesitation.Drinks stay hot for hours.
It's a little pricier than some other models and only holds 14oz but it's perfect.
The reason for the 4 is because the screw on top will "pop" into two pieces.
Nothing in the instruction manual tells you this and if you don't discover it dirt and mold will grow here.
Once you discover it you can force it apart and clean it.
Does what it's supposed to: insulates beverage, does not leak.
My husband and I each have one of these for the am coffee on the go.
It's truly leakproof which allows me to throw it in my bag without worry.
My husband uses the mini-carabeener it comes with to attach it to his bag.
Icy drinks stay icy even in a hot car while I'm out running errands.
This was a screaming deal when Amazon ran this last year at this time for about $7.99 each with super saver shipping.
I particularly like to use mine in the car because the handle is helpful when I'm driving.
hands down the best travel mug for hot drinks (coffee for me, tea for the wife).
Forty-five minutes after leaving home, he sits down in his office chair to 14 oz.
Second, it doesn't fit well in most cup holders, making it harder to access on the road without the driver becoming seriously distracted.
Some were better than others, but I've never come across a travel mug I would classify as great - until now.
This one has an intelligent design that puts it way above other travel mugs I have tried.
The screw-on cap can create a very tight seal.
Be careful about screwing on the top too tight - it can be a bit hard to unscrew.
However, if you need a really tight seal (say you were throwing this into a backpack), it's available.
A couple of turns will open up the top while leaving the cap loosely attached, and you are ready to drink.
You can decide how big an opening you need.
The oval lip of the mug has a slight groove which channels the liquid into a manageable stream for drinking.
I use this mug when I feel like taking coffee with me on my motorcycle.
I can lay the mug on it's side in my saddle bag for my 45 minute commute to work and it doesn't leak a drop.
Coffee is still so hot that it burns my tongue when I arrive at work (even on 50 degree mornings).
I must have my coffee in the morning, and this mug is ideal.
It holds about 2 mugs of coffee, is stainless steel which is a safe material for your health, and is sturdy and well designed.
I find it to be leak-proof if you close the dial in the lid, and it fits my car's cup holder.
You must turn the dial in the top of the lid to drink, but it is a comfortable drinking cup with no dribbles.
I like the ergonomics of the handle too.
My husband is picky! and he really liked the way it keeps the coffee hot.
I like the fact it is dishwasher safe.
Overall, a great mug and seems to hold up well to constant use.
This holds an adequate amount of hot beverage and DOES NOT LEAK! At least when you remember to close the top securely, lol.
Strongly recommend to anyone looking for a travel mug.
It performs as advertised - leak proof and keeps beverages hot/cold for hours.
Very good quality mug that will last a long time.
I use it for cold liquid rather than hot and my test is to see how long the ice lasts.
It will keep the drink cold and the ice from melting for over 24 hours.
The most I had to do was file down one side of the lip the got jagged from one of the street tumbles.
I fill it at the airport and pull it out on the flight and it's still hot.
Now my favorite mug is broken, and I must buy another one.
I've had many coffee mugs in the past- this one will stay with me for a very long time.
I Received this travel mug a week ago and use it everywhere.
Keeps my drinks ice cold all day even in the Hot beach sun beating down on it with little melting of the Ice cubes inside.
I could not believe it still had lots of ice inside it the next day after I went to bed.
Seems to be very well made, fits the hand well and designed by someone who had a brain.
Easy to swallow without spilling, you just twist the top a half or full turn and sip from either side.
You may find other travel mugs for less but for the approx $20.
I just ordered another one for my Mother.
A key fact about this insulated mug--and all similar--for the curious: they are not stainless because it looks cool.
It sounds kooky, but I've been overwhelmed by this discovery twice in the last decade.
As this coffee gets colder, you will discover that your sips become gulps.
because you want that "hit" of the hot beverage and the flavor.
Lots of thought went into the shape and how well it conforms to your face when you drink.-It's leak proof, folks.
I think some who have reviewed it poorly in this regard have mistaken the claim: it's leak proof if you seal the lid.
As for whether you spill it while you're drinking, nobody can account for how one person drinks.
This is a great mug and it works as advertised.
It keeps my drinks hot for my trip, and I don't worry about spilling (it hasn't).
The size is just right for me (fits a good sized drink), and the design is well thought out.
After tightening the lid to keep it from spilling, it can be a little hard to turn the lid a bit so you can drink.
Just pour into the cup and enjoy a cold drink.Recommended!.
I bought mine quite awhile ago and put it through some abuse.
To date, it doesn't look anything like other than brand new.
I preheat the cup and then fill it and cap it right away.
I haven't yet had to resort to tools to force it open, but it's been close.
A friend commented on my mug &#34;fancy schmancy&#34;.
I love my classy, durable coffee mug! It never leaks and I like it because it's not cheap looking.
It was absolutely leakproof and remains so after three years of daily use.
It's good for 4 to 5 hours at a very drinkable temperature! Season it with ice cubes and water for cold drinks.
In my case, buses have no cupholders and the non-slip handle fits easily over the sun visor, keeping my hot coffee within easy reach.
I wish I had a commission for each of these cups bought by my fellow drivers!.
Bought two of these about two years ago.
Have removed the carabiner and keyring since the paint came off and they starting getting brittle after a year of dishwasher washings.
Excellent product, glad to see I can come back and buy one if I ever need another.
This mug is very easy to clean and keeps hot coffee warm for a long time.
This is a quality product that was designed and manufactured by some smart people.
It's a simple thing - I like to sip my coffee in the morning.
Pottery mugs allow the coffee to cool way too soon.
It did not even have to travel well  - just not leak or drip.
It doesn't spill and I can easily attach it on my purse if I get tired of holding it.
I wash it by hand with a brush that doesn't damage stainless steel so it works great!.
I've been using this mug daily for five years and I love it now as much as the day I bought it.
It's sporting a few war wounds, including small dents and paint splotches, but that only makes it more special to me.
As long as you do not overfill it, you can tip it upside down, shake it, and not one drop will spill out.
Hot drinks stay hot for hours, and cold drinks stay cold for just as long.
On hot summer nights, I put ice water next to my bed and there is still ice in the mug the next morning.
That is, no coffee aftertaste.Some reviewers have complained that this mug is hard to clean.
Less coffee, fewer trips to the bathroom, fewer jitters.
I cannot recommend this mug highly enough, and I think the price is just right.
Just bought a second for stock as I worry that this will eventually cease to be sold and I will lose the one I have.
With the lid on tight heat is retained for over an hour.
On one's desk without the lid it outperforms your standard coffee cup in terms of heat retention.
Hardly a negative compared to all the junk out there.t.
I as looking for a tough, leak-proof mug with a carabiner, so I can hook it to my work backpack.
If you need a leak-proof mug, get it!.
Thermos Nissan is here with a mug that does not leak (as long as you don't overfill it).
They suggest pre-filling it with hot water if you want to keep a beverage hot.
Hours after filling it the coffee was still hot.
This isn't the biggest mug in the world.
You might want to look through the lineup if you want more than this is capable of holding.
Really, this is the best mug I've owned.
Does what I need it to do! I highly recommend this product!.
No spills when sipping and closes up tight to prevent spills when you're finished with your coffee and toss it in the back seat.
I only wish they made a bigger version.
But for now, this is the best travel mug on the market!.
keeps thing hot/cold for about 6 hours at most.
Lid is a bit difficult to put back at time.
watch for amazon price changes..i was able to get it for under 10$.
I like it because the top screws closed to prevent leakage.
I've dropped my cup on concrete and it didn't break or spill.
It does not, however, keep my coffee hot for an hour.
It keeps coffee hot for a few mintues but the temp drops to lukewarm and stays that way for an hour before it gets cool.
I open it to sip some, then close it for a few minutes, then open it to sip some more.
The whole process of opening it allows the coffee to cool down some each time.
Perhaps it keeps the coffee hot for an hour if you don't open in that time frame.
It fits in my car's cupholder quite well.
It keeps cold beverages cold for an hour or two but I don't use it much for cold beverages.
I took the carabiner clip off and use the clip elsewhere.
Nice mug overall and I would recommend this to a friend!.
You can close the lid all the way...and not a drop will ever spill.
To drink, just turn the lid half a turn and drink, then screw back shut.
Thermos Nissan 14-Ounce Leak-Proof Insulated Travel MugI am very happy with my Thermos Nissan.
It doesn't leak when knocked over and keeps liquid hot/cold for hours.
Bought as a present for a relative who like coffee in the car.
I also thought it was well made and looked nice.
Based on this third hand feedback it gets 5 stars.
This mug, without a doubt, is the best insulated travel mug ever put on the market.
I bought the first one for my wife for Christmas.
She loved it, and I liked what I saw.
So I decided to get myself a second one.
The product is built solidly, and really does keep drinks well insulated.
This product is worth every penny, and I highly recommend it without hesitation.
It is small enough to fit in a car holder but large enough to satisfy a committed coffee drinkers need.
This is my second mug - this one is for my wife.
Never a dribble - completely safe with books or papers (and I am VERY careful and respectful of books!).
Keeps hot tea/coffee hot to warm  for hours.
I love everything about my Thermos travel mug.
It is simple to use, has a comfortable handle and seals very well, yes, leak-proof.
this is a fine mug for teachers, business people etc.
it is rugged and has a weighty quality.
I've had several travel mugs over the years.
I've used this one daily for about 3 years nowTRAVEL MUGS ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL.
If you buy one of the cheaper mugs the walls are not vacuum insulated meaning that there is air between the walls.
You want a vacuum between the walls and this one has it.
The difference is having coffee HOT for 3+ hours vs having coffee warm in 30 minutes.Then there's the lid.
This one uses a silicone rubber o-ring and screws down.
What that means is that coffee will leak in eventually.
Over the course of the week I have to pop the lid open and clean it once or twice.
Not a big deal but it seems they should have been able to make it sealed.
I got this to replace my recently deceased 20+ year old DLC7.
It uses all of my old blades (but not the juicer)and looks great.
I was surprised and pleased by how smooth and powerful the Power Prep was as compared to my trusty DLC7.
The dough button is a nice addition as well.
works well and reduces motor wear, I think.
The extra large feed tube is a time saver.
This cost a bit more than the basic 14 cup model, but it was well worth the extra cost.
The extras were worth over $100! A nice surprise making this a great deal.
Consumer Reports rated this highly, it's a big machine and I was fed up with my small one.
I am very pleased with it - it copes with everything I have asked it to do, mixing batters and doughs in no time.
With the rack everything is put away and it locks closed to keep it tidy when you stow it in a cupboard.
There is an interlock on the large food chute to prevent you putting your fingers down it.
However, you can put a large chunk in and then place the pusher on top, and the machine will work.
I have been using this design for years.
I wanted the 11 cup product but could not find it it stock.
There are no bells&whistles; but it will work for years if you do not abuse it.
Expect 10 years or more and you might need new blades before the motor gives out.One off for price.
We bought it about 4 years ago to help make dough, our dog's food (raw veggies and chicken), sauces, mayo, etc.
One gratin recipe called for 3 grated potatoes.
After about 1/2 a potato on a hand grater, I decided to bust out the food processor attachments.
I am a little embarrassed I didn't just start with this machine.
It comes with a regular processor blade, a dough blade, a slicing attachment and a grating attachment.
I used the grating attachment, and it had finished grating the potatoes in about 1.5 seconds.
I wanted to grate 10lbs of potatoes right then and there.
After that, I just left the processor on the counter.
The attachments and the bowl are all easy to clean as well.
I'm the one out of ten people who gets the one that is in some way defective.
Two full weeks have gone by, and no response at all.I also tried calling them on the phone.
I was on hold for 20 minutes before someone finally answered.
They said &quot;Cuisinart Please Hold&quot; and then I was back on hold again.
After 10-15 more minutes on hold I finally gave up.I checked another one at the store.
Thank goodness for great stores that let you try products out.
The Custom 11 finally gave up the ghost during my recent holiday raw vegan food preparation, after years of serving me efficiently and well.
The Custom 11 replaced my original 7 cup Cuisinart which I bought in 1980.
I chopped, sliced, shredded and ground with ease.
The PowerPrep just purrs! It is so EASY and so QUIET ~ 2 huge pluses for me.
The ease of operation is a Godsend for someone like me who suffers with the limited mobility and cognitive impairment of a disabling chronic illness.
Living with my disability usually involves a constant struggle to complete kitchen tasks that are otherwise impossible.
Handling knives can be dangerous; chopping, slicing and grating painful; standing over the kitchen counter and cutting board exhausting.
I have already ordered a 2 mm thin slicing blade disc for processing cabbage for my homemade sauerkraut.
But really, 12 years, and this thing is still a cookin' machine.
Note: Amazon says I bought this in November 2011.
Its blades are as sharp as the day they came out of the box.
The plastic over the buttons is worn from use.
Got as a gift for my wife after our other unit died.
She uses it all the time, I think more than the old one.
Runs well, quieter than the other (don't expect a silent food processor), and motor runs strong, even when kneading dough with the included hook.
The dough mode is a good feature if you will be doing this.
I want to be able to very thinly and evenly slice English cucumbers and other vegetables.
Even fairly slim English cucumbers have to be quartered lengthwise to fit down the feed tube.
cucumber is a bit misleading.If you want to use this for any other purposes it is probably a superb machine.
Just be aware that if the big mouth capability is important to you, that you may be disappointed.
I don't want a machine that I could fit a hand into, of course, but I believe Cuisinart could do much better than this.
Years ago I got my first Cusinart DCL 7 and it served me well for close to 25 years when the base finally cracked.
I purchased another Cusinart  howevetr it was smaller.
My thought was that since I wasn't cooking as much, I would need a smaller machine.
This machine doesn't balk at heavy doughs, slices, chops, whips, grates without problem.
It is heavy enough that it doesn't skip around on the counter.
All in all it is a good machine but the use of flimsy plastic rather than metal is the only detractant thus far.
Imagine kneading bread dough to perfection, in as little as 40 seconds! Its how I make FRENCH BREAD.
I also make all my dinner rolls and sweet rolls in the Cuisinart (yum)!Easily mix cakes, quick breads, and piecrusts.
Plus it features a powerful induction motor for HEAVY DOUGH.
wheat dough (1 large loaf) even in this model.
The other metal "dough" blade is for kneading the heavy dough recipes (anything over 4-6 cups of white flour or 3 cups wheat flour).
If you like these tips, you'll love my cooking info website: [...].
This is the 2nd Cuisinart food processor I've bought in 32 years.
I have no complaints, number one just plain wore-out from use.
The motor will not engage unless the bowl, blades, and cover are correctly aligned.
I hope that is not the case with the plastic bowl, chute, and motor casing.
For motor strength, ease of use and clean-up, and attachments, no one makes a better home food processor.
This is the previous-model top of the line Cuisinart 14 cup.
Most powerful motor (1000 watt induction), heavy weight Lexan bowl.
It's a quiet workhorse that will probably last a lifetime in a home kitchen.
With the dough mixing capability, you do not need a food mixer.
This processor is a heavy duty all purpose device every working kitchen needs.
The plastic parts are heavy duty and well designed with operator safety in mind and dish washer safe.
I highly recommend buying the parts caddy to protect the sharp blades of the chopper and slicers.
The only thing I would like to buy is a larger diameter veggie feeder top so I can slice larger tomatoes and onions.
I do not know why I did not buy this before.
It is a must have for any kitchen.Save time and energy by buying this must have kitchen tool.
I love to cook, and his cheese grater was the best I'd ever used.
(I never buy the store shredded cheese, I grate it myself).
Never did I dream that it could grate cheese as well as it did.
It also did a fantastic job of chopping up the many cups of various nuts I used in many recipes over the holidays.
Oh, and it did work pretty well on the fruits and veggies, too.
(And I never thought anything could take it's place in my heart).
It's been much nicer to have around than I had expected.What I like about it:- Fairly quiet, which is a huge plus for me.
It's a nice looking appliance and easily fits on my countertop.- High quality plastic pieces.
I got this processor to replace my (still working) 5 yr old Cuisinart DLC-2011 white.
There is a slightly different locking mechanism on this model that allows for this.
This was a pleasant suprise that I was not expecting.
I  was fine with the other way because the machines capabilities far outweighed the little oddity.
I had first accidently ordered the brushed chrome DLC-2011 and was dissapointed that it was infact silver plastic so I returned it to amazon.
I then ordered this Brushed Stainless DLC-2011CHB machine and recieved it.
I am so glad that I didnt settle for the silver plastic one as this processor really is nice looking.
I think it is great to combine beauty with power and performance and this one has it all ! Highly reccomend.
I have used this machine a few times and it chops and slices supper fast, and so efficiently.
I made scalloped potatoes over the weekend; 6 potatos were sliced under 30 seconds.
I am used to being able to place the entire potato length wise.
This is not an issue now that I know the vegetable to be sliced needs to be within the cavity and not sticking out.
I will be ordering the thinner slicer wheels.
Looks good - doesn't hog too much counter space so I am very happy with this product would recommend it.
I had a smaller one and it was always a problem.
The only difficulty I had was learning how to snap the bottom and top parts correctly into place.
At first I thought I had a defective product, but with patience and some practice I was able to master the technique.
It is very powerful and I do like the pulse method of chopping up foods to the size I want.
It is great for salads, which is the most frequent use we make of it.
I got this processor to make some recipes that I've been coming across in some Paleo cookbooks and this one works great.
It's easy to use almost no food gets &#34;hung up&#34; and unchopped.
Great for slicing items for stir fry, even mushrooms.
My new 11 cup Prep Plus just arrived (3 days sooner than expected -- thank you, Amazon) and I'm all jazzed to start using it.
I'm particulary excited about being able to grind meats and make breads.
Plus its not really light-weight, so not having to move it in and out of a cupboard is a plus.
I recommend getting the disk and blade keeper for the extra attachments that came with the machine.
After seeing how sharp these guys are, it seems safer to have them not laying loose inside a cupboard or drawer.
I bought it as a present, and the person I gave it to is very happy.
She said it is easy to use and clean and does everything she needs it to do.
I learned the hard way after attempting to make almond paste in my mini FP.
Decided it was time to &#34;graduate&#34; and get something bigger--and with this fun red machine, I can do ANYTHING! Love it.
I recently purchased this processor after debating Kitchenaid or Cuisinart.
I needed the normal processor functions (shredding/slicing/pulverizing) as my cheapo (25+ yr)processor processed some of its own parts.
It took several batches before I figured out how to best do so (and required ignoring directions on DVD).
The dough only needs to be kneaded for a minute--two at the most.
Every loaf I have made produced excellent results--even the ones following the DVD.
The problem there was that the dough did not mix properly when streaming in the liquids.
The mixture was going under the blade and rising up into the crevices of the blade--nasty cleaning job.
After about 3 cleanings, I just tried putting everything into the bowl and going from there--adjusting texture as I needed.
I use the recipes from my breadmaker cookbook.
Everything from whole grains mixtures to sour dough have turned out beautifully.
Yes, it does slice and shred very well although some of the food gets trapped between the disc and the lid.
My discs seem to be stainless steel although others have reported theirs were not--maybe a slightly different model (mine is DLC-2011N).
I had only used my other processor for shredding and slicing.
This one is being used at least weekly.
There are many techniques (egg whites and cake mixes, for instance) I haven't yet ventured, but for now, I am really happy with my purchase.
I use it everyday, it's my favorite appliance.
I made ham spread in this first and in no time at all it was blended to the right consistency.
I am very pleased with the power of this motor and its performance.
Been wanting a new processor for a long time.
I've made pizza twice which I have never attempted before.
I could not decide which size to get but this 11 cup is a great size for us.
I asked for this as a birthday gift from my mother in law.
I love it and I use it all the time.
I grind nuts for baking cakes and cookies.The motor is very strong and quiet, the footprint on my counter is relatively small.
It tends to chop some stuff very fine by the time the largest pieces have been cut up.
If I want an even dice, I still have to do it by hand.
I asked for and received the Prep 9 for Christmas.
To say I am delighted is an understatement.
The Prep 9 is perfect for all but the largest families.
I doubt my KitchenAid mixer could do that well, and my bread machine will only handle one loaf's worth of dough.
Make the bread crumbs for my chicken supremes or chicken Kiev?  Check, check, and check.
(Just dry them in the oven on a large cookie sheet and store in a Mason jar and you'll always have plenty.
Awesome.)  Whatever I ask of this machine, it does without complaint.
I need to have the thumb joints in the palms of my hands rebuilt and thus have a lot of pain.
This wonderful machine does what I can no longer do without a lot of tears.
It comes with two flat blades, a chopping blade, and a dough blade, and there's very little else you'd need.
I owned one for about 30 years previously and gave it to my son thinking that I could handle cooking for two without one.
I need this, I love this, and I recommend this most highly.
The bigger the family, the more it needs this, or a larger one for really big families.
No other brand even comes close to the power of the Cuisinart.
This new one is basically the same as my old one, but is designed to give me better leverage if the bowl gets stuck.
It also has a wider feeder opening so I can fit larger whole fruits and vegetables.
It's very easy to clean and not too heavy so I can put it away in my pantry when not in use.
I actually bought this food processor to start making natural dog food for my dogs.
I also purchased the additional 3-set blades for the machine also.
The motor runs so smooth and is very powerful.
I also like all of the safety features that prevents any type of accidental mishaps while using the food processor.
The 9-cup capacity is plenty, although they make them smaller and much larger, this is the perfect size.
The Cuisinart Blender is the perfect size for my needs.
The hold times for customer service are ridiculous; I end up having to hang up before an agent can assist me.
Cuisinart plastic has not lived up to my expectations in their other products either.
It really cut down my cooking time and has enabled me to experiment more as well.
I am  a busy working women and don't really have time to do it all manually and I think this beauty is worth every penny.
I am able to cook more and make healthy food for myself.
I use it for everything from shredding to juicing.
It has been almost 6 months now and it's going strong.
I found the motor very quiet compared to others that I had in the past.
I do agree with the other statements about the container being a bit on the cheap side.
If you don't abuse it and under normal usage it should not be a problem.
I use it at least two times daily.
I only had it for a short time, but it seems to be a work horse.
I needed something to lessen the amount of chopping I needed to do by hand.
still need to hone my skills with the processor its not to finely chopped, but saving on my joints is worth the learning curve.
I still have my really old Cuisinart food processor, but decided to pass it along to my nephew.
I have used the slicing disk, the chopping disk for bread crumbs, but have not used the dough disk just yet.
Only referred to the instructions to ensure that I had everything put together just right.
It takes up less room than my old one so it saved me some room.
I might need more practice.I had a Black and Decker, WOW this one is a few steps up.
I bought one for my wife last year, now I bought one for my granddaughter.
The same Model but in White, didn't fare so good with users comments, funny.
I highly recommend this Model and Amazon handling the sale.
Merry Xmas and Happy New Year to all.
The stainless finish is attractive and easy to clean.
My old cuisinart had seen better days and I decided to purchase this new one.
The price was very reasonable and it looked attractive.
It arrived promptly, and the machine works like a charm.
It seems to me that this motor is more powerful than the one in my old machine...though it just may have been its age.
Food processors come in many sizes and power levels and many have only a few blade disk choices.
Cuisinart has doe it just right not to big to keep available and plenty of accessories to make it capable for many tasks.
If you have never used a food processor, now is the time.
I have done pizza and bread dough in it with great performance.
I really like the options of the feed tube sizes.
I liked it so well that I bought our daughter one for Mother's Day even though the price had gone up $20.
No problems at all as far as reliability, electrical, etc.
Look for a long time for the right one and this was it.I am very pleased that I purchased this one.
Doesn't really take up much space on the counter that a 13-Cup one would.
So wished I had purchased one before this as it really gets the job(s) done.
I bought this to replace a Moulinex, which is no longer made.
I scoured Ebay when my first one broke after 12 years, found another one used which lasted another 6, and now I'm out of luck.
After checking dozens of reviews, I went with the 9-cup cuisinart.
This seems like it would have been such an easy fix.
just a little handle or even an indent in the round blade so you can grab it and pull it off.
If any readers have any hints how to disengage the blades (perhaps I'm missing something), please let me know.
I was a bit hesitant to buy another Cuisinart as my 7-cup Classic died shortly after it was out of warranty.
I was never exactly thrilled with it and found it not very powerful.
I have used it for slicing, chopping, mixing and shredding and my usual twice a week batch of hummus and I am very pleased.
It is also a very sturdy machine, you don't get the sense it's going to take a ride when it's running.
I thought it might be too large for my uses but it's not.
I also noticed some complaints from reviewers about linking up and locking the bowl and it's attachments.
I didn't have that problem but then I'm accustomed to how Cuisinarts work.
So give it time and you will be hitching and unhitching the parts easily.
I do agree with some of the reviewers that the stem attachment for the slicer and shredder attachments is a bit of a pain though.
While my wife does most of the cooking I have been known to dabble in the culinary arts.
This food processor makes short work of even tough root veges and the selection of blades pretty much cover the gamut of cutting needs.
The unit is easy to assemble and colors (I have the blue one...) are bright without a cheap sheen.
Safeties prevent accidents, despite my best efforts, and the unit is well-designed as a whole.
Cooking with power has never been more fun.
I needed to replace one that was lost in a flood.
This new updated model has a wider opening and easy to close top.
This is my first large  food processor and I love how it works.
I've had a Cuisinart Mini prep for years and felt that I needed something with a stronger motor and more options.
So far I've used it to chop meat to make dog food, make pizza dough, grate cheese, cut potatoes and other veggies.
It's kind of heavy and I've found a permanent home for it on my counter.
Clean up is easy and the video and manual are very easy to follow.
The only issue I have with it is that it won't shred semi-soft cheese (mozzarella and provolone) no matter what I do.
I've tried freezing it and it still hangs up in the grating blade, it's much easier and less frustrating to just grate it by hand.
It's a nice size, but the 11 or 14 cup would have been a better choice.
So we filled the kitchen sink with hot soapy water.
Bought 2 for my 2 daughters at Christmas,They just absolutely love how they save time with them.Excellent I would recommend to all that want quality.
We bought 2 of these for gifts to family members.
We have owned a larger version of the same processor for years and love it.
Works great, throw it in the dish washer and you're done.
Doesn't get much easier....I don't know how anyone who cooks a lot could live without a food processor of some sort.
Returned this item, as it was ordered in error.
It would be wonderful to own, but right now it is not in our budget.
A friend has this unit and I have watched them use it.
It's everything we wanted in a food processor.
We use it when preparing meals for larger groups (e.g.
I will prefer this brand when shopping for other kitchen appliances.
I have Cuisinart DLC-2011 Prep 11 Plus Food Processor for about a year and i wouldn't even think that i could use it so much.
I've got additional discs and i can do anything.
I would probably ish to have a bigger size, but this one is ok and i didn't want to spend more.
I've spent the difference in price on discs and discs holder.P.s.
The disc for french fries doesn't work for frech fries, but it cuts real nucely for home fries and soop.
It was done slicing my cucumbers before I even realized what was going on.
A little confusing at first but nothing I couldn't figure out.
Slices very thinly but I understand different size blades can be purchased but I love the thin slices.
Everything works spectacularly.Many reviews said the bowls were flimsy.
While they are plastic, they seem durable enough for me.
The machine is easy to operate, and not as confusing as you first think when you open the box.
I recommend watching the video first, then referring to the instruction manual if you still have questions.
If you have an older version of a cuisinart food processor that still works, please wait to buy this one.
I bought this for my wife and it has almost the exact same parts as her model from 10 years ago.
I wish i would have waited for her old one to die.
I thought htis one would have more gadgets since its newer but its about the same.
The good thing is that almost all the blades from her old one still fit in this one.
Well, after about the 3rd or 4th time using it, it died.
A 13 cup Kitchen aid has a 350 watt motor, the 9 cup Cuisinart has a 600watt motor.
Not only that, the Cuisinart uses an induction type motor, where the others (Kitchen aid, Oster etc...) use a capacitor to assist the motor.
these capacitors are notorious for wearing out, but it is a simple matter in replacing them.
The Cuisinart motor is very quiet, amazingly so.
Thats not a big deal for me though.
but i do a lot of bread and pizza, so it wasn't going to work.
Very happy with it, worth the extra $31 bucks and 4 cup smaller bowl.
Could have bought it at a local JCPenneys for 149$ but it would have cost even extra for taxes.
that would have been an extra $30 bucks for me.
Best device in the world for bringing together a pie dough.
It's also easy to clean - dishwasher and a damp cloth.
They are essentially identical to the ones used for this machine (save for those being made in Japan and the new ones in China).
It has a much bigger feed tube so a medium sized onion or tomato goes in whole.
The size of the unit (for me) is ideal.
Perhaps for very large families the 14 cup unit would be the way to go.
I think this design is more prone to cracking.
The new unit has a stainless steel beam which when inserted locks the unit.
It is a great design.Another great impovement is redesign of the small feed tube.
That material is much more indestructible than whatever lesser plastic was used to design the older small feed tubes.
Bounce an old one off the floor and wham -- the locking tabs would break off of it.
I only clean it in the sink though.
I would not run this through the dishwaher repeatedly -- especially with fully heated drying.
After hundreds of cycles I just can't believe the parts will come out in as good of shape as they would with hand washing.
If you have plenty of cash then run them through the dishwasher and then replace parts in five to ten years.
I purchased this item with a gift card at a retailer in my local mall.
I have had it for several years, and it has worked great.
The blades are still as sharp as ever.
I have used the main blade and the slicing blade; I haven't had a use for the grating blade yet.
I wash it in the top rack of my dishwasher with no problems.
It has a small latch that holds itself in place.
Now I only untwist it when I need it.No complaints whatsoever.
It is large enough and powerful enough for me.
I would purchase this item again, if I needed to.
I upgraded to this machine from my tiny two-cup food processor.
I cannot live without it and it is so easy to use and clean.
My old one was such a pain because I had to process in batches, I love having the larger size.
Great product, Cuisinart has never let me down!.
This is a real professional piece of equipment.
The motor is really powerful, attachments high quality and this will be infinitely better than any food processor that you have ever owned.
There are model numbers that are almost exactly this number and priced the same too.
This is the unit to buy, even the other Cuisinart Processors are no competition to this model.
Plus, it was never easy for me to disengage the one bowl from the other.
And I struggled to find a managable place for the diffferent blades for the different bowls.
For me, it was a drastic move to put that more expensive Elite away.
Also, I feel repair-service response-time and customer service in general was very poor in my experience.
As a technologically challenged person (meaning I don't read the directions carefully enough) I Almost broke this the first time I used it.
Luckily a friend was with me and saw that I had the cover on backwards.
I tried making  fake soft serve ice cream, using only fruit.
You don't have to buy that $50 device.
You can use this processor and it came out creamy and perfect.
I use this just about every time I am in the kitchen, and still can't believe how long I went without it.
After it broke (less than a year after purchase) I saw no reason to replace it.
My biggest gripe with this machine is that you can put the bowl on backwards.
You shouldn't even be able to do this.
If they had made an irregular triangle out of the fasteners they could have easily solved this issue.
I'm a fan of the safety feature (the blade stops spinning automatically when you remove the top part).
I've made nut butters where I need to process continuously for 10-20 minutes, and the unit has performed really well.
I've never had a problem with overheating or the engine getting tired.
The wife really likes this Food Processor and has many options.
I did a lot of research before selecting this one.
The price was right at Amazon and I have selected many Cuisinart Products which are medium to upper level.
Also, this price from Amazon was the best.
The instruction booklet was also very helpful and has lots of recipes.
It's spiral bound too, so it's meant to be used more easily.
This guy is about as much as anyone would ever need in a food processor.
It does everything and it does it easily.
It's extremely well built and should last a very long time.
Consumer Reports was on the money with their positive recommendation on this unit.
I have been using the same tiny food processor for 8 years.
I finally asked for a new one because my use increased when I switched to a paleo diet and I needed one with bigger capacity.
I went with 9'cups and am happy I did because it seems like the perfect amount.
Now the part that made me fall in love.
This took a matter of seconds as the device took care of business in no time.
I am so happy I received this as a gift for christmas.
I no longer have to fear when I use it that it might wake a child.
Previously I had other brands of food processors, parts of which broke fairly early on and did not do a great job.
So I decided to invest in a Cuisinart this time.
I keep this on the counter because I use it several times a week for chopping, grating, slicing and mixing.
This food processor and my Vitamix are among my favorite tools and make food prep, cooking and baking a breeze.
Got this 9 cup to replace an older 7 cup.
Does almost everything well and looks good doing it.
Only complaint is it doesn't chop veggies as evenly as I want.
Always wanted one, and now I have it.
Now I can easily chop stuff cuz I cook every night.
she is very much enjoying this as she has begun to cook vegan and gluten free.
we were initially confused when we received two metal blades and were expecting one to be a plastic dough blade.
It took a little while to figure out that one of the metal blades was actually a dough blade.
This is not consistent with the picture but it all worked out and she is very happy.
Haven't used this much yet but, the few times I have I've loved it.
It washes well in the dishwasher even after shredding cheese.
I like the way the top fits on better than my old DLC-8.
I sometimes had to put my arm around the old one to disconnect it.
The stainless is attractive and I keep it out on the counter.
It is heavier than my old machine which hasn't been a problem for me since it stays out now.
Thought the price was reasonable, too.FYI, discs from the old machine work with this one.
For food prep from making bread dough to grating parmesan cheese, it's such a time saver.
We bought this one to replace and older one.
This particular unit is not too big but also not too small, just right making dinner for two to four.
although this food procesor is very powerful, I'm giving tis 4 stars because dry ingredients shoot out of the top.
I love the processor overall, and would still recommend it.
However, be prepared for a little clean up.
This motor is strong and not ridiculously noisy considering I use it to do everything from mix dough to make nut butter.
The blades that come with it do pretty much everything I need.
i am able to clean it in the dishwasher.
I would suggest getting the blade storage accessory with it.The last cuisinart I had lasted through my grandmother and myself (20+yrs.).
I have high hopes for this one, too.
I have never been a huge fan of Cuisinart but this food processor always gets good ratings.
The plastic is more flexible than the old style.
It chops & shreds everything I put in it.
I'm not sure how I survived without this!  I made pizza with it and it was quick, easy, and the best I'd ever tasted.
What you can do with this, and the power it has, is phenomenal!.
This processor works wonderfully!  I use this about twice a month or so, super easy to use and to clean, highly recommended!.
I bought this to use while teaching my granddaughter how to cook, because of the safety features.
However, I ended up using it for chopping onions and zucchini relish to can as well.
I love the heavy duty feel and weight of this processor as well as the safety features.
The chopper blade is fantastic - it doesn't get food stuck under the blade like most processors do.
It chops and/or purees everything in the bowl - no large chunks left over.
I wish I had it when my family was young, and I did a LOT of canning of produce.
If you don't want to have to chop, slice, mince or puree by hand this is the processor for you!  Saves my time and fingers!.
I have been salivating over these for many years.
In the few weeks that I have had the 11c food processor, I have put it through its paces.
I've sliced, diced, chopped, shredded, pureed, mixed, and made dough.
I've done hard cheese, softer cheese, peppers, potatoes, onions, chicken breasts, cabbage, carrots, and anything else I could think of.
It has done all of these things beautifully.
What a time saver! This food processor has made cooking even more of a joy.
My family is tired of being called into the kitchen to see how cool this appliance is.
It is great how the discs and blades have a little symbol on them showing you what direction they fit on to the knob thing.
I haven't had any problems with leakage, food getting into places and not coming out, or any kind of cleaning up issues.
All the parts have gone through the dishwasher with no problem, and of course they was up beautifully by hand.
I am happy with the 11cup size as I am cooking for three people.
It's a little big, but good for the upcoming holidays.
This is for the Stainless Prep 11 Plus which we purchased at Bed Bath & Beyond with 20% off coupon.
We have been cooking so much since subscribing to Cook's Illustrated and reading all kinds of recipes online.
It does weigh a lot, but it's very solid.
It includes the chopper blade, slicer blade, grater blade and dough blade.
Be sure to begin with pulse and check the progress.
It's so powerful, if you just push ON and ignore it, your onions, etc.
This processor works very well for almost everything, chopping vegetables grating cheese etc.
Makes food prep so much easier for a large party or family dinner.
The only thing it didn't do well was onions.
It turned them into a liquidy mush!  Just use a knife.
Other than that I am happy with this purchase.
The extra wide mouth feed tube is a great improvement.I had the 7 cup with the smaller mouth and found it very hard to use.
This is one is great.I can fit so much more in it without having to cut the stuff down to size.Very happy with it.
A lot of people have already reviewed how well the unit works.
I'd like to add that the customer service is also great.
I'd decided to shred some mozzarella and started working on a block of the cheese.
This put enough force on the detentes holding the lower portion of the tub, that the plastic broke.
I called up customer support, and with no questions asked, had a new replacement piece shipped out in 10 minutes with no cost to me.
I've seen a lot of complaints about customer service for this unit, and cannot disagree with this more.
I process all my veggies at once for salads, soups and stir fries.
It is so quiet - 9 cups is plenty big for my needs - and doesn't take up too much space.
I bought the Disc & Blade Holder at the same time and so glad I did.
I would recommend this to anyone in the market for food processor.
We had a KitchenAid before and this thing blows it out of the water.
It takes half the time it did before to make salsa, or hummus.
I'm extremely happy with my purchase and will most likely be buying more from the Cuisinart line for my kitchen.
Best purchase I have ever made for my kitchen hands down.
The quality is simply the best and there are just countless ways to use this machine.
If you have been thinking about a food processor do not waste your money on the cheap ones you can find at some stores.
I have used this an average of 5 times a week and had nothing wear out.
According to him he "didn't want to @#$# with spaceship parts until he had the proper certification." lol.
In reality it is very VERY simple to use AND clean (pull the parts off and hand wash.
This 9-cup processor is the first full food processor I ever owned.
So far, I've used it to puree, chop and slice and done as per instructions, it does the job perfectly.
Highly recommended.*** I just want to add that the standard and specialty disc sets for 7- and 11-cup fit this 9-cup processor.
It is mentioned in the food processor's box.
I own both disc setsCuisinart 3-Piece Specialty Disc Set for 7- and 11-Cup Processorsand wrote a review about them.
I also ownCuisinart DLC-842TX 2mm Thin Slicing Discand it works perfectly with my 9-cup processor.
The wife has never had a food processor, bought this based on the review's and she uses it all the time!  She really likes it.
There are certain brands you can't go wrong with, and in my experience Cuisinart is one of them.
This food processor is perfect for my uses.
It's just the right size and does a perfect job of pureeing, grinding, slicing, and shredding.
It's easy to use and cleans up easily.
It starts with the unpacking and repacking instructions you see on the box flaps as you open the box.
Further, the individual parts of the processor are easy to clean.
Having watched the DVD and breezed through the manual I took on slicing and chopping veggies for chicken noodle soup.
Setting up the processor as the bowls and blades connect by turning them in the same direction was straight forward and easy.
This processor is quiet which was very surprising.
I did a lot of comparison shopping and reading of the reviews for food processors out there and decided on this Cuisinart 9-cup model.
Although it costs a bit more than its competitors, I am very happy with my investment, and found a reasonably priced one on Amazon.
The capacity is just right, it has an extremely powerful motor, and does a great job with grating, slicing, and pureeing foods.
I have a bread machine, so I have not yet tried out the bread making blade that came with this processor.
I would not try to store it on an upper shelf or on the fridge, though.
All in all, I could not be more satisfied with this processor, and I highly recommend it!.
Comes with a DVD which took the intimidation factor out.
Everything goes in the dishwasher -- I don't hesitate to use it.
I am reviewing it from the view of a  person who knows machines: a former typewriter repairman.
We have a "cheap" brand processor that has served us pretty well for 20+ years.
Living in two locations now so needed a second.
We got an HB "bowl scraper" model that turned out to be seriously defective.
dual bowl on impulse at a local big box store.
Even their reviews said it wasn't very durable so we took it back.
This Cuisinart was highly rated and went on deep discount just when we needed it so we went for it.
Liked that it was SS like our other appliances.That brings up the first minor criticism: It really looks more like polished chrome than brushed SS.
There are a few brush marks but not what you would expect.
Not a huge deal but not what the pictures would lead you to expect.
could stand up to being dropped without damage--I like that.
I was leery of the switches hidden under flexible plastic.
I'm not so thrilled about the big mouth chute.
I know something like this is necessary as this prevent the blades from turning when the pusher is not inserted.
A child or not so clever adult could easily put their hand in and get it chopped.
In fairness there is a small chute you can use and just leave the big one in place.
Still it adds much more complexity and more room for things to fail.
I think all large chute machine have some variation of this safety interlock.
We had a chance to by a discontinued model with the old narrow chute but they seem to be gone now.
It does of course allow for faster processing of whole vegetables.
The way the disks attach to he shaft seems much sturdier than others we have seen.
The liquid capacity is listed in the manual which you can download on the product page.
Now I come to what I consider the shining quality that makes all of these minor flaws seem acceptable.
The HB we tried sounded like a NASCAR racer.
This obviously has an induction motor like the commercial (read four figure price) Robot Coupe processor that we had borrowed from my brother-in-law.
Thank heavens for a company that realizes noise counts for something.Oh, the clear plastic parts are BPA free.
It's attractive, takes up very little counter real estate, and performs beautifully.
One thing you'll love is the wide food chute.
I had no idea these things could do so much till we encountered one at a family reunion.
It has paid for itself on shredding cheese alone!  (I was buying bagged shredded all the time).
Fantastic even for dried goods!  I told myself I would use it and put it back in the cabinet - well.
I used it for every recipe and it made things go so quickly.
I could make so many different things and clean up wasn't as big of a pain as I thought it would be.
I have had this for 8 months and couldn't be happier.
I'm glad I chose this over the kitchenaide.
Great safety, it won't turn on if the top lid is not locked in place, so there won't be any missing fingers :-).
I use it for everything I can think of.
I've had this for a few months and I use it all the time.
I haven't bought any upgrades or extra attachments yet but it works so great for my cooking needs just with the base package.
It's very easy to clean & the blade is sharp and powerful.
So far, I've used it for chopping veggies/nuts, sauces, hummus, cheese spread, pizza dough and grating cheeses.
I should have had one of these years ago!.
I chose this model because it was recommended in Consumer Reports Magazine.
From delicate lettuce, to dense potatoes, every piece is beautifully uniform.
You will wonder where this processor was all your life.
I was impressed with how effortlessly cookie dough came together and how easy it is to make butter.
Will I start making all my butter? No, but it is a fun novelty to try with the kids, or to whip up herb butter.
I think the bowl is a good size.
I cut all the veggies to make stir fry for 4-6 people without emptying the bowl.
Best of all, every removable piece pops right into the dishwasher.Cons: Shredding cheese and meat were not as easy as I thought they would be.
The biggest surprise to me was that it didn't puree my corn chowder as well as I expected.
My blender has done a better job in the past.
I tried making meringue cookies merely out of curiosity.
When they say &#34;precision cutting&#34; they mean it.Overall I am very pleased.
I am looking forward to the next potluck so I can whip up a big batch of scalloped potatoes or slice veggies for a salad.
I would highly recommend this food processor to others.
I got this as a gift for Christmas and absolutely love it.
I'm still experimenting with all it can do, but my new favorite lunch item  is chopped salad.
I am very happy with the performance of this processor.
It is easy to use and clean after use.
I had purchased a few of the smaller, cheaper food processors/choppers in my life.
Always was left unhappy in how they had no power whatsoever.
I finally broke down and paid more for a quality food processor.
So much easier than standing there for several minutes with a grater!  And when I am done, I just throw everything in the dishwasher.
I have used mine now for about 6 months or so, and nothing has broken, but I am extra careful with it.
Hasn't happened yet though, so I am still very pleased!.
A little on the heavy side, but has lots of power.
A little hard to clean up, places that are hard to get to.
I almost talked myself out of this model after reading the reviews, but took the plunge anyway.
Perhaps those reviewers are new to cooking and/or using a food processor?  Anyway, the stem/disc combo is no big deal.
The blades and discs are sturdy and heavy duty; very impressive.
DEFINITELY watch the DVD that comes with the food processor.
It helps make sense of the whole set-up, and the cooking demos are great.
I have a huge garden and do a LOT of canning.
This processor has significantly made my life easier.
It does a great job, easy to clean and I love the built-in safety features.
It simply won't turn on if you don't have it properly attached.
I got this as a replacement for one that I brutally abused, and it went up in a puff of smoke.
I picked Cuisinart because I've had good luck with their products.
I picked this model based on the reviews.
I've only used it a couple of times, using the blade.
The base is heavy, which is a good sign.
I've washed the parts (other than the base) in the dishwasher, top rack, as described in the instruction booklet, they came out fine.
The equipment is sharp, so some caution needs to be exercised.
I want to use the disc's for shredding and slicing.
I tried using them and found it a good idea.
The blades are easy to put in the container and take out, the discs as well.
It saves a couple bucks and might avoid a scrape or two with the disc holders.All in all, I'm happy with the purchase.
I've used it on all types of foods now and it does an excellent job.
My only negative would be that I wish it held just a little bit more liquid.
When making tzatziki and other sauces I find that I'd like it to hold maybe a cup more liquid.
After never allowing myself to purchase a decent processor, I'm completely in love with this one.
There is nothing revolutionary about it--it works, and works well.
Cuisinart has made its plastic container thicker, so it is easier to handle and the parts are quick to load.
It works very easily and loads easily, too.
Cuisinart supplies a dough paddle and we have had very good outcomes with pie dough,.
cuisinart is one of the best producers of food processors in the business.
Great attachments/options and a solid product make this THE food processor to have.
I bought this appliance as a Christmas gift for the wifey and she loves it.
Ever since I got this product I get to eat a whole lot of great food So I think it rocks.
I have needed a food processor for years and have always trusted the Cuisinart brand to provide high quality products.
So when I finally decided which one I wanted, I looked at all the brands, but hands down Cuisinart had the best reviews.
I wanted one with a dough hook attachment but it seems they are not made any more, so I settled on this one.
It has a dough blade, which I tested out on cookie dough first thing.
I doubt that would be necessary if there was a dough hook attachment.
But for the price, this one does great for everything else I need it for.
Guacamole turned out pureed though, I have to practice on that.
Well, not really...but it is an excellent addition to my kitchen.
I have had it for a week, and have used it every day, literally.
I have used every blade and every disc that came with the set.
Easy to clean...be careful when washing the blades and discs they are definitely sharp.
Motor is quiet, has not strained yet with anything I've sliced or mixed.
The video that comes with the instruction booklet is awesome.
How I got along without one these for so long and kept all my fingers I do not know- enough said.
I never thought I needed a food processor until my older brother made latkes (potato pancakes, sort of like hash browns, but with added ingredients).
Seems my Cuisinart items seem to be holding up better and used slightly better then my top-of-the-line Kitchen Aide items.
Although I like the Kitchen Aide items for their looks.
(I'm just mentioning this, as I dislike safety features and enjoy slicing my fingers.
Hopefully with most or all parts stainless steel, there won't be any corrosion issues.4) The bowl I found is really easy to clean.
Matter of fact, if I'm only chopping vegetables, I can easily just rinse and dry the bowl parts on a rack.
This will limit the length of size of items you can place in the chute for slicing or shredding.2) The handle sits in front.
Likely also, the blades will go dull faster, too.
It is far easier and much faster to just chop chocolate with a serrated bread knife and wood cutting board.
About the only items of slight annoyances are, the counter-clockwise tightening of the lid and the small food pusher.
raw carrots) can be easily finely shredded and/or then finely grated using the chopper -- attaining a very fine grind quickly & easily.
Cream cheese frosting can also be quickly made, unlike the initial clunky blender method -- once creamed, a blender can easily be used.
Had an older one that finally broke after 20 years.
This one is a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but with only the two of us, it serves its purpose.
Last night I shredded some brussel sprouts for a slaw, and it worked perfectly.
I am sure that it will be fine for other chopping and processing jobs in the kitchen.
I only wish I had purchased the 11 cup model which is what I previously had.
After replacing the bowl twice, I decided it was time for an upgraded processor.
I got this DLC-2009CHB because it was a good value with good reviews.
I think 2009 indicates why it is a good value as we near the end of 2012.9-cups seems the right size for me.
The locking mechanism seems solid and appears like it will last.
It has three locks -- the base, the life, and the pusher.
Concerns me that all three must work but, again, the seem solid and the reviews do not indicate frequent failure.Likes:--This baby looks great.
And it does not take up much of a footprint on the counter.
I keep it in a place where the height does not matter.
As others have said, it is tall -- much taller than my old one.--It is powerful.
Has make simple work of the stuff I tried so far.
All simple enough like grating hard cheese, soft cheese, veggies etc.
I do not plan to make dough in it (never did in my old one but I might give it a try in this one).
I am guessing it has whatever power is needed for whatever I ask it to do.--Cleans up easier than my old one.
Sure there are nooks and places for water to get trapped.
I have taken to cleaning the bowl and lid by hand most times.
The bowl because it cleans about as fast as I can rinse it.
The lid because it almost never has had stuff on it.
They are available but a bit pricey considering the price of the entire unit was so low.
I'd drop big things in there and as it is, you need to stop the unit and then restart it.
This seemed a bit odd when grating a big hunk of cheese that is taller than the push unit.
The push unit needs to be slightly engaged in order for the blade to start.
The small opening is too small to handel a big chuck but could handle tall thin things.
Maybe I'm missing the best way to do this.Overall:--I highly recommend this unit for basic food processing.
I'm glad I got the 2009 model for its simplicity and value over the newer model.
My fianc&eacute; bought me this food processor as a Christmas present.
I'm pleased to say that we're both impressed by its appearance, thoughtful design, and performance.The brushed stainless finish is attractive and easy to wipe clean.
The handle-in-front work bowl design is accessible to me (right-handed) and him (left-handed) equally.
However, you are not stuck using the big opening all the time.
The lid is secure but can be removed and replaced easily.
Everything fits stably and securely on the motor base.
Big chunks of onion, celery, and green pepper chopped evenly in a few pulses using the S blade.
Big chunks of cooked turkey chopped evenly and smoothly without pureeing.
The included spatula got all the food out of the work bowl quickly without making a mess.
This verifies that the attachments for the 7-cup model fit this 9-cup model too.
This was a Christmas present and does everything it needs to.
Not as loud as I thought it would be.
Like the various ways to put food into the bowl - large chunks as well as small.
The blade is lower than in my last (cheap) food processor.
So small things like garlic can be chopped up easier.Once you turn on the machine, you feel the quality.
For those of us who have never owned a food processor, my amazement at the simplicity of operation and the culinary results just simply astounding.
From the structural design and obvious countertop appeal, this 9 cup model is truly a beautiful enhancement to your kitchen.
My very first attempt at mixing dough for biscuits was a success and surprize.
I have never felt a more silky texture for dough.
As far as I'm concerned, there is NO other name in food processors than Cuisinart, and the DLC-2011N 11-cup is one of their best.
Got it from Amazon about 18 months ago, during a Fourth of July special, and the price was great.
I also purchased the supplemental blades and disc holder, and they have come in really handy.
We use this food processor almost every day and the blades are still sharp and all components are still 100%.
I cook a lot of shredded potato hashbrowns and coleslaw/shredded veggie salads and always hated shredding them by hand.
I'm also too cheap to buy shredded cheese and used to shred large blocks by hand.
If you have trouble lifting things, I would suggest that you make a permanent home on your counter for this item.
Speaking of washing, there are a lot of parts and pieces, but it washes up pretty quickly and easily.
Cleaning it is a small price to pay for how easy it makes my food prep.
The reviews on this one were impressive, so I paid the extra for it.
I actually read about the various blades and uses in the instruction booklet, which is unusual for me.
First - the shiny stainless appearance and heavy base are beautiful and impressive.
Fortunately, the easy to assemble and use functions are just as beautiful.
I am now finding excuses to use it for more creative and helpful slicing, chopping, processing than I ever did before.
For small spaces and small families, this is a great option.
I bought the 11 cup  food processor for my wife as a wedding gift.
I purchased this food processor about 6 months ago and I'm still loving it.
It is easy to use, easy to clean and just the right size.
Not to mention it looks great on my counter.
Much bigger than I expected & very well made.
I expect to use this for many years to come.
Great features, comes with a DVD, instruction manual, recipes, and a spatula (as well as the extra slicing & dough accessories).
It is pretty heavy duty & will take up a bit of space on your counter though.
I bought this processor because my daughter recommended it.
She has this one and has been very pleased with it.
She uses it for everything from Pizza dough to pancake batter.
I turned my diet into vegan about 10 weeks ago.
I must say this tool is a great support for bringing creativity in a vegan's nutrition plan.
There might be similar or better processors out there but this works just perfect for me.
The processor works well but some aspects of it are frustrating.
When your shredding hard to medium cheese, sometimes the cheese will get stuck between the blade and lid and rolls around.
Frozen chopped spinach will lump up and raise the chopping blade above the bottom.
Fresh kale was copped perfectly though even when loading the bowl to over flowing, it all came out evenly chopped.
Overall I like it, But not sure about the price point.
I haven&#8217;t used the dough blade yet, but will to make pizza next.
The only complaint would be that it  could use a few more  discs; julienne & fine shredder,.
I ordered the extra discs so Robles solved.
I did a lot of research before buying this processor.
I wanted a processor that I could make nut butter with, and this does the trick.
But I find, that I also use it daily for cooking/prepping an array of foods.
This size is about perfect for my family of four.
The base has a small footprint so it does not take up too much room.
The only draw back is you have to cut the food small enough to lock the feeding insert in or it won't work.
It will work if you use the small streaming hole.
It is easy to use and makes quick work of cooking chores.
I use this almost daily to cut veggies, shred cheese, and puree things.
This being my first food processor I honestly didn't know what to expect.
I relied on Consumer Reports for guidance and bought what I thought was the best choice for my intended uses for this kitchen appliance.
Upon removing the Cuisinart from it's box I quickly realized that this thing is solid.
Firm heavy base filled with the promise of a strong motor completely sealed for messy cooks like me which makes for easy quick clean up.
This was the easiest french bread I've ever made.
It's my new toy so to speak so I've got plenty of dishes awaiting it's ample bowl.
So far I'm 9/10ths satisfied with my purchase.
I burned up my old Cuisinart, it was really old so it had a good life.
Bought a cheap Black and Decker since I wasn't cooking much but that was a real waste of money, even if it was cheap.
Decided it was time to get a new food processor and read many reviews and Consumer Reports before deciding on this one.
The Black and Decker was so loud that I just couldn't use it anymore, it really hurt my ears.
This food processor is even quieter than my Vitamix blender.I have made bread, finely chopped veggies and shredded veggies with no problems at all.
I like the large opening since I can get more veggies in for shredding.
Grab the blade hub, and remove the metal blade before tilting the bowl, using a spatula to scrape off any food.
Then carefully lift the blade out of the work bowl.
This machine is quiet, powerful and a joy to use.
Well, the little hole at the bottom of this food processor works perfectly for this procedure.
Between the job commutes, working out, kids, chores, and other pressures, there is little time to cook a decent dinner.
Heretofore I have chopped the majority of my vegetables by hand and that is both time-consuming and tedious.
I had thought to go with Kitchen Aid, but alas their offering was long on function and, well, short on aesthetics.
This can proved useful for slicing cucumbers, carrots and the like.
All of the parts are easy to use and remove.
I got this food processor as a wedding present, really like it.
So far made salsa, hummus,-- things that were difficult to do in my pathetic old 2 C food chopper of the past.
Also made pizza dough and an incredible pie crust using this device.
I was worried that this size might be too big for my 2 person household, but it's actually perfect for us.
Too many little nooks and crannies for food to get stuck.
Otherwise it's a fairly powerful machine although a bit brittle.
The main bowl chipped after the FIRST use but I didn't feel like messing with the whole exchange/return process.
I bought this to replace a B&D food processor (see prior review) with a major design flaw.
I am prepping for Thanksgiving dinner and after one use of this food processor I am hooked.
I didn't have a problem with sliding lock feature as my prior food processor had similar feature.
The motor is *quiet* and the blade chopped without any effort.
The fill line for liquids is pretty low but I guess I will just have to process liquids in small batches.
One of the best buys we ever made for our kitchen.
When one finds a fantastic item, one should extoll its virtues.
I simply wanted to upgrade our food processor.
The GE one we had was 10 years old and it didn't do much well anymore.
The slicer insert has completely replaced my mandolin (love making apple chips with it).
The stainless steel is gorgeous and easy to clean.The only drawback is the stem in the center when it comes to liquids.
It would have been nicer to be about an inch higher.
Occasionally, liquids leak out of the lid and from the bottom even if I only fill to the line on the side of the container.
There is only so much it can take.
Loved that processor.There are a lot of great things about this new processor that I enjoy though.
It's powerful enough for my heavy home-made pasta dough.
It's totally beautiful (bigger than it looks in pics).
I did a lot of research and seriously considered the KA Architect with the adjustable blade (tempting feature!!!).
But, I'm still really happy with my choice of Cuisinart again.Update: My work bowl chipped and the processor no longer locks closed.
I can't find a replacement 9 cup bowl on Amazon, and elsewhere online, the bowls seem to be on back order.
When I put this food processor on my Christmas list last year my parents doubted whether I would actually use it.
I do not have a bread maker so all of my kneading has been done by hand or using my stand mixer.
The dough blade has proven perfect for making bread dough in my food processor.
I also dabble in vegetarian cooking and find that the dough blade also works perfectly when making seitan and other vegetarian meat substitutes from scratch.
They work wonderfully for grating cheese, shredding lettuce, and slicing vegetables.
I love how it cuts my prep time in half and is easy to clean up afterwards.Overall I have been thrilled with this appliance.
As other reviewers have said, I am at heart a Kitchenaid girl, but the usefulness and durability of this appliance speaks for itself.
When the plastic blade mount on our 25-year old Moulinex food processor disintegrated recently, I looked online for replacement blades.
That's when I discovered that there had been a recall on the cover for the machine [[...]].
And it does what it is intended to -- chopping and blending with ease.Looking for a food processor at a reasonable price? Buy this one!.
As a single guy that loves to cook, I could literally "kick myself" for not breaking down and buying a food processor years ago.
I would put off certain recipes due to all of the chopping/grating etc.
I'ts done, and I am one very happy camper.
We've had this 11 cup unit for two years now and have not experienced any problems.
We use it for pizza dough, pureeing, soups, sauces, bread crumbs, pesto, some chopping etc and have never had an issue.
I never had any high expectations when it comes to chopping or kneading dough with one of these.
I realize it's not going to chop uniformly so anything I make that needs to be presented to guests goes to the cutting board.
I also never considered kneading anything more than pizza dough with this unit as it's not big enough to do much more.
We either knead by hand or more often in our stand mixer, which you can control the speed with.
easy to use, clean and does the prep work i don't like or want to do.
After reading reviews I decided to purchase this processor although I had some concerns about the size of the feeding tube.
I have shredded meat, kneaded dough, all things I couldn't have done in my other processor.
I don't understand the bad reviews on here, I think these people just got bunk processors.
I use my processor all the time and have owned it almost 3 years now.
I got this (in white) as an early B-Day gift that I picked out.
I got it on ebay for  30% off amazons price.
My only processor experience prior to this is a little 2 cup black and decker model that I got for Christmas.
So when looking for a food processor I was entirely doing my research and comparisons online.
After reading reviews and comparing products and prices I came down to choosing between 2 food processors.
At first it was a close call because of the extra stuff that comes with the KitchenAid.
What truly sold me on my Cuisinart in addition to it's power, additional blades ect.
For instance I can stick a whole potato in mine and make instant hashbrowns or fries.
with the KitchenAid you would have to cut up the potato first and fries.
please, it may have the disc but who wants dinky little bits.
I was utterly amazed at how it handled it so well.
I am I first generation food processor owner and Will never go back!! I highly reccomend this food processor.
Just bought this processor last week and I'm already in love with it.
Since I've never owned a processor before, I really didn't understand the impact it would have on our lives.
There are so many foods that we love, but didn't have often because of the time and work they required.
This machine is SIMPLE to use, even for a processor novice.
It's EASY to clean and doesn't require a great deal of counter space.
Absolutely the best gift I've ever purchased for myself.
I even make cake batter in it that is smooth and silky.This is an amazing product.
It saves money and a lot of time.
No need to chop or buy prepared foods again.
I used this to slice brisket, corned beef, prime rib, and other roasts.
The blades are very sharp and cut effortlessly through the meat.
We were really pleased with this electric knife after our battery operated Sonic knife.
The stand holds the 2 knife blades securely, the safety buttons on the knife handle are great, and the two blades work really well.
We use it to slice home made breads as well as slicing roasts.
We would recommend it to anyone looking for an electric knife.
Hi All, having a holder makes it accessible so you are more likely to use the bread blades.
It cuts well, isn't too heavy, and feels good to use.
The stand has plastic parts, not metal, but all pieces are held at the top to prevent tips.
I bought this carving knife for Thanksgiving and have used it a few other times.
I find it easy to use and it carves easily.
I like the wooden mount that comes with the knife and fits nicely in our kitchen drawer.
I picked this item up at a local store.
I used it to cut steak for a stir fry and for a loaf of bread.
I stacked 3 steaks on top of each other and it cut through all three effortlessly.
It is easy to use and does an excellent job.
It was much easier than doing it by hand and the cuts were nice and clean (and no crumbling for the bread).
I had tried another brand and it was not useable at all.
so I'm glad that I tried this product (almost gave up after the first one).
Well, I am not disappointed...Cuisinart does it again.
Well worth the the price and so wonderful to use.
Did some research and although I'd prefer a rechargeable without a cord, I highly recommend this because of its quality and effectiveness.
If it had been as good AND cordless, I would have given it five stars.
This is my third purchase of exactly this product.
It's overall good quality and easy to use for lots of cutting and carving tasks.
Only complaint is that the blades don't seem to last all that long, and when they dull, the knife tends to shred rather than cut.
I got this to replace my old (Like over 20 yrs.
It has a nice stand  and two blades.It is perfect for any cutting from tomatoes to bread.
Hence we began with this knife then that one - nothing was superior and especially when carving and having to hold the button etc.
So we went on a hunt and have actually been looking and looking over the past year for a better than average electric knife.
He loves it - I would strongly recommend this knife no doubt about it as would he!.
My husband and I have tried them all over the years.
This Cuisinart electric knife set is the best electric knife set that I have ever had.The seperate bread blade is wonderful.
What I was really looking for was a battery powered knife.
But, the few available have terrible ratings so I wound up purchasing this corded knife.
I wanted to replace a corded Hamilton Beach model that we've had for a number of years.
As some have noted, in many homes these knives come out only on holidays to carve the meat.
This was true for us, but, we have recently gotten interested in bread making, albeit, cheating by using a bread machine.
The hardest thing about making your own bread is slicing it (I guess that's why someone invented "sliced" bread).
If you try to use a standard bread knife, you have to hold the loaf so tightly that you "crush" it.
What you end up with is a slice shaped like an hourglass and about 5 inches tall by 1 inch wide.
An electric knife solves this problem although it takes some practice to cut a "straight" slice.
Looking at the many corded knives on Amazon, there didn't seem to be any that were that highly rated.
The prices for most knives were in the $25 range, about half of the price of this knife.
I reflected on problems I had with the Hamilton Beach.
The biggest problem is that if you want to use if daily, you have to leave it on the kitchen counter.
The knife with the blade installed takes up a lot of room since it has to "lie" down.
It's too much work to remove the blade, unplug it, and store it in a cabinet.
This Cuisinart solves that problem by allowing you to store the unit vertically.
It's pretty easy to remove the blade and return the blade and knife back to the storage block.
But, one of its most important features is that it looks really cool on my countertop.
Even if it fails, I will keep it there just to impress my friends when they come over.
The unit also has a more flexible cord than the Hamilton Beach.
If I could add anything to the Cuisinart, I would add MORE blades.
But, if you're go to pay $25 for an electric knife and take your chances, why not pop another $25 and get something really cool!.
We are extremely pleased with the performance of both knives - one for meat and one for bread.
They cut great, are easy to clean, and easy to insert and remove from the knife handle.
The knife holder/stand leaves something to be desired...the cord has to be folded up and then tucked behind the stand.
The stand is not as nice as we thought and instead of keeping on the counter we "hide" it in the cupboard.
However, the stand does not take away from the great knives.
This knife replaced an electric knife lost in a house fire.I first purchased a different brand, a Hamilton Beach Model 74275, that was unsatisfactory.
It feels high quality, that is, solid with good materials.
In use it cuts easily through turkeys at holidays, which is my normal use for the product.
The knife has good balancer in use and is quiet.
The blades are easy to remove for washing but are unlikely to be removed accidently.
The knife also comes with blades to cut bread.
Those to me are pressure sorts of situations, which may seem silly, but I rarely carve meat and want it to go well.
This knife helped me to make it go well.
It comes with a nice holder to help keep it out of harms way in a drawer.I would purchase this product again.
This product would make a very nice gift and is in a reasonable price range.
Small, weak old hands could use a smaller thinner lighter handle.
Other than that it beats trying to manual cut meat.
Too new to know about longevity and reliability but so far so good.
Yes we recommend it and look forward to a new improved model.
I love this knife, cuts great!  The blades when inserted do not come apart while slicing meat like other electric knives I have owned.
I have used many different electric knives over the years, but this is the best one yet.
It has excellent balance, so its non tiring on extended use.
I havent been disappointed yet when buying from Amazon,.
The knife arrived promptly, nicely packaged, in perfect condition.
The blades (one for meat and one for bread) are sharp and cut perfectly.
A bit more expensive than other knives but well worth the investment.
I purchased one of these for Thanksgiving 2012 and was SOOOooo glad I had.
The carving was easy; the meat beautifully sliced:  ham, turkey, and brisket.
I loved the uniform look when the meat was arranged on the platter.
Caveat:  Four months after I purchased it, I was using it again.
I didn't realize I had incorrectly inserted the blade.
During the cutting process, the  handle suddenly cracked.
It wasn't until then that I realized my error.
It seems there should be a warning on the knife (a light?) that alerts the user to that error.
I hardly think I am the first to make that mistake; suspect it is fairly common.
I did not feel it was safe to keep using the knife with a cracked handle.
Since it had been my error, I did not feel that asking for a replacement via warranty would have been right.
I knew I would invest in another electric knife because I had enjoyed that one.
I shopped around again but didn't find a knife that I liked better.
This one replaced a 36 year old Sunbeam that finally wore out.
I am impressed with the styling of the knife and the two blade set options.
The butcher block storage idea is cumbersome if you store the knife anywhere but on the counter.
I threw mine away and just store the knife in the drawer.
In spite of that, it still works fine and I use it often.
Fast, lots of power, well built, and both sets of blades preform very well.
I wanted to try a meat knife instead of a bread knife while doing my BBQ competition.
It worked great on the meat, it did not tear as the bread knife does.
I bought this knife in November after reading the reviews here.
It rests in the drawer just fine with the other larger utensils.I highly recommend this knife.
I use this knife to take apart home-made bread or crusty baguettes, and to trim cake skin.
The bread blade is the one getting used, the other one is still in plastic.
No dead animals in my kitchen so nothing to carve with the other blade.I like the knife.
With this and chainsaws you can only build so much safety.
Arm (blade and plug in) only when using.
Watch fingers when the bread has a smooth sloping surface (baguettes) and keep steady and start slow.But it SO does its job.
It took me a while to learn the right way to stick the pieces in.- Maybe there are engineering obstacles, but I hate the cord.
I wish this was offered cordless, just because it's hard to work with when right in front of the electric outlet.
If high consumers like irons and power drills can be cordless, so can this knife.
I was going over range restrictions, safeties and stuff but that would make a long review longer.
I used it to cut up a 10-pound turkey breast within an hour of receiving it.
El estuche muy bueno pues esta siempre a mano en la cocina.
quality product from the people who makethe spinning cutty things.
Easy to use and clean.quality construction is evident.
With the festive season approaching, wanted to have my meats cuts evenly.
There's an on/off lock on the power trigger which is a solid safety feature.
Blade release buttons are simple to use which makes cleaning easy.
The storage case secures all components in a single area so when re-using, it doesn't become an exercise of re-locating each individual part.
Motor provides enough torque to cut through bone joints and tendons.
Am expecting that this kitchen tool will give many years of service.
After doing my research I decided to spend the extra money and buy this Cuisinart electric knife.
The knife is clearly very well made, and the two blades work very well.
While at first I thought the wooden stand was a gimmick, I have found that it works well and is a space-saver.
I store mine on the counter and it looks surprisingly good.
The knife performs very well and is easy to use and clean.
I cook a lot, so I know that having a good electric knife for my roasts makes it much easier to slice.
This knife does a great job, so I can cut quickly and neatly without a lot of fatigue.
I bought this electric knife as a wedding gift for the wedding of one of my many, many nieces.
You can never go wrong with a Cuisinart product - good quality!.
I hate slicing up the turkey or roast or ham by hand-this knife makes it a very much easier project.
It is easy to clean and stores very nicely in the included mounting board.
This is my first electric knife, and I'm glad I read the reviews here on it before buying it.
Works like a charm, easy to clean and operate, and makes slicing our homemade bread very easy.
Bought this to cut memory foam into pieces.
This knife did an AMAZING job!!  We haven't used it on the turkey yet, but it's a nice set.
I occasionally smoke meats for weddings and private events.
I also used it for my entry in the Memphis in May event where clean cuts are essential.
I've had this knife since 2004 and it is working as great today as it did when I first bought it.
I bought my first one in 2000 or 2001 and loved it.
Unfortunately, it got left behind when I left an ugly relationship.
Not willing to go back for it, I ordered another one here at Amazon in 2004 and have loved it ever since.
I used it frequently on homemade bread and many roasted meats from chickens and turkeys to roast beef, ham, and pork.
One was using it to cut up a whole roasted pig at a luau.
After 20 minutes of constant use, it gave out.
Well, duh! I would never consider that sort of use to fall under the category of typical household use.
Some sort of professional industrial model would be better suited to that sort of use.
The price is good for what you get.
It's actually 90 cents cheaper now in 2012 than it was when I bought it in 2004.
I have not used an electric knife in many years.
But I am sure that would be a great thing if you made your own breads.I would highly recommend this knife!.
I have used it for Bread and Turkey.
Blade are shape and I am impress with the safety button.
I got this to cut fresh squash and it works great.
This item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase.
I like it very much and am VERY glad I ordered it.
Thank you so much Amazon.com for the great price,  good value and prompt delivery.
This is my first experience with an electric knife so I have nothing to compare it to but, and I'm very happy with it's performance.
It's quick and easy and I can toss the blades into the dishwasher.
We replaced a much older version of blender/processor duo.
Wow is the Cuisinart better! Powerful blender, easy to clean and not a lot of storage space required.
We got this blender/food processor set as a housewarming gift about four years ago.
I use it all the time and it hasn't broken yet so I don't know what I'm doing right compared to other people.
I also wish the wattage was higher so it could pulverize berry seeds in my smoothies, but such is life.
I'll use it until it dies then probably get a stronger one.Overall though it's treated me very well.
It's the black part that sits between the food processor bowl and the machine itself.
But since we've had it for at least four years now, I'm not too surprised.
Here's to hoping that it'll hold up even longer after we invest in the parts!.
I've had this Cusinart model for at least 3 years and have used it for a variety of purposes.
It seems like every year has a new color to keep up with the decorator's choices for that year.
I was surprised to learn that I had not purchased this from Amazon but it must have been another online site.
So far, for the past year, I've used the blender with no problems.
I don't use it often and have used the food processor once.
You have to either use the blade or the slicer/shredder, you cannot use both at once or, more importantly, store both in the bowl.
I've used wide scotch tape to cover the blades and tape to the bowl so the pieces don't get lost.
That's another thing, you have to use a little white connector for the slicer/shredder.
Be careful not to lose that little plastic part or you're screwed.
DON'T LOSE THE LITTLE WHITE CONNECTOR PIECE!  I've been very pleased with the blender.
If it burns out I will simply buy a new one but I will not buy "the duet" I will buy separate appliances.
It's worth what I paid for it at the time over a year ago and the blender works very well.
I've only had this blender a couple of weeks.
It is loud, but it is so much better than my older GE blender that I am in 7th heaven.
I know, because I filled out the form and then found my part, so I called them.
it is VERY sharp - I know because stupid me put the blade loose in a drawer, reached in, and cut my finger.
Now it has a special place on a little nail in my cabinet.
:)  Seriously, be careful with that thing!The blender makes great mixed drinks and is easy to clean.
It's awesome.My only complaint is that I wish they'd made the feeder tube a bit wider.
You can fit about an average cucumber in there.
I enjoy using this unit and the only negative is that it is a bit small for the food processing portion or the unit.
Does the job but I should have picked a little bigger one.
If smaller is what you are looking for this is a good buy.
and easy to store because of size, too.
I have the white version of this item for 7 years! I received it as a wedding gift.
Yes it is very loud, but it's the first item like this I've ever owned, so I didn't have much to compare it to.
But it's easy to clean, works fantastically, and has nice design.
It has worked great until about a month ago when a friend was using the food processor at a party, to chop something.
I lost all respect for Cuisinart after having to deal with its huge, horrible, engineered by satan Grind and Brew coffee maker.
But since this particular item was such a bargain, 34 dollars, refurbished and since I needed both a blender and a processor I capitulated.
So far I am happy as a clam, it works beautifully.
As for being refurbished it came absolutely perfect.
No dings, no scratches, it looks brand new and runs brand new.
The Thanksgiving holiday coming up will tell me if it is going to take heavy duty use.
Both arrived looking and performing as if brand new.
And both were dirt cheap compared to regular prices.
The Cuisinart CPT-35 is a relatively inexpensive, no frills toaster, so you can't expect much from it.
You DO have to change the settings for individual items.
The extra wide slot is great for large, specialty shop bagels.
The cancel button works as an ejector so you don't have to force up the toasting lever.
The construction is lightweight, at least compared to my old T-Fal toaster.You won't find fancy features with this toaster.
The cancel button and the wide slot are the only notable features, and they are hardly high-tech.
For an inexpensive toaster, the Cuisinart works as well as can be expected.
No more shaking the toaster upside down over the sink to get it clean.
And the three year warranty, how can you go wrong.KitchenAid- 1 year warranty.
Our  bagels are not burned on one side.
Our old toaster was only 3 years old.
I also like the  shape ,it takes up less space on the counter.
A nice feature is the cancel control, if you change your mind you can cancel.
My wife and I got married about a year and a half ago.
No one bought them for us because they were too expensive.
I had previously just picked a different brand of knives for the registry based on limited research.
That experience exposed me to variety of knife brands, including the viking brand.
There's not a bad thing I can say about them.
Just be sure to wash them by hand and treat them like the investment that they are.
We bought these to replace a lower-end set of serrated Henckel knives.
And I've done my best to keep them out of the dishwasher.
The blades on this have held up well and are still razor sharp after using them for about 14 months.
A few runs down the sharpener and they cut things crisply.
The culinary school reference is questionable also...Le Cordon Bleu uses Mundail knives...etc.This a top of the line set and shouldn't be maligned out of ignorance.
I received this knife block as a wedding gift and the knives are absolutely fantastic.
They cut everything like it's butter - with very little force required.
I've never owned a high end set of knives but they make a huge difference.
I do wish that the block would fit theZwilling J.A.
This set might be overkill for someone who doesn't enjoy, or doesn't do a lot of cooking.
Cuts through a rib roast like it's melted butter and allows perfect cuts every time.
I have been wanting this knife for quite a few years.
This is the best knife for slicing thin cuts of raw or cooked meat.
As with any fine cutting tool always hand wash and dry after each use.
I rarely use a meat slicing knife, but if you want paper-thin slices without tearing, this can do the job.
So you want to slice something?  This is the knife.
You don't want to use any other knife for slicing - this thing makes beautiful thin cuts.
I've used it on Thanksgiving turkey - to die for.
Fantastic addition!  The high carbon steel blades on all the J.A.
Henkels knives keep an edge that's razor sharp, and that includes the steak knives.
This knife was no exception to that; razor sharp out of the box.
haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I'm going to find a reason.
i am a one brand girl, well, as far as Calphalon goes.
My pots are all Cals, and when I saw these, I just knew I had to hve them.
They seem to take the more extreme temps I wrongfully work with.
Unlike every other brand I have used and cripsed in the past.
I use these both on non-stick (which I don't have much of) and the regular Calphalon hard anodized stuff.
They are big enough to be useful and won't harm non-stick or scratch and leave marks on stainless as well.
I do put them in the dishwasher, (top shelf) and they USUALLY come out clean.
Anything with melted cheese or gooey stuff probably will need to be scrubbed with a dobie.
They have a nice balance and don't fall into the pot...they are so long that probably wouldn't be a problem anyway.
This high-temp set has worked very well for me.
I was skeptical about the &quot;high-temp&quot; worthiness of the plastic, but it has proven itself.
I use the spatulas on an indoor grill and no meltdown so far.
I love Calphalon products and this is another example of a few that are great!.
Since I have some of the Calphalon nonstick pots and pans I needed safe utensils to use with them.
These are the perfect companion to my nonstick cookware.
There is no reason why you could not use these on regular cookware as well.
Overall I rate these utensils as very good to excellent.
These are made to last forever!  My daughters keep stealing my spoon though, they love that darned spoon!  Great set, great investment for my kitchen!.
The Calphalon 4-Piece Nylon Utensil Set is a perfect way to begin your collection of these well-designed and useful nonstick kitchen essentials.
There is also a generous-sized soup ladle and a serving spoon.
I love to keep my black nylon Calphalon utensils in a tall crock jar near my stovetop for convenience.
This rack is exactly what is needed for a big turkey or any big roast.
It is solid and will last a long time.
I'm not much on writing reviews so I will be brief.
This rack is the best on the market, Why?This rack will hold any bird you can buy.
It is non stick so no torn skin.
It keeps your bird off fat and juices so it will cook more evenly.
lastly soap and water cleanup is a breeze.
I've had this rack for over a year now and I've used it many, many times.
This particular rack is offered in a larger size, but when I bought it last year, this was the only choice available.
I'm very happy with it -- I've cooked a few 20+lb turkeys in it and don't see the need for the larger rack.
The rack doesn't look as lovely as the day I got it, but geez.
it's been roasted a couple dozen times and it's still going strong.
It is well constructed and the flat bottom helps the roasting process well.
i didn't need to, but sprayed it with non-stick spray anyway.
The most important being that the base stand 'legs' is/are wide enough so it is not tipping and falling over hot in the oven.
I have not used it enough to say if any coating comes off or not with usage.
Was looking for something to fit in my medium kamodoo style bbq grill, this fit perfectly.
Couldnt give 5 stars because meat will stick to it- more stick resistant than non-stick.
There are three noticeable places where the forging, or connection, shows which give me pause and I hope won't be a problem in cleaning.
Of course, even Calphalon has their products made in China now so if I get lead poisoning from my roasting rack, so be it.
The v-shape non-stick rack is cleaned in my dishwasher and I expect this one will be as well even though instructions suggest warm soapy water.
How else will you get your ginormous bird out of the roaster.
It is sturdy but it is no joy to clean.
That is why I have rated it 4-stars.
This is the type of item, because of its sharp, fixed, hard-to-reach angles that begs to be dishwasher safe.
I wonder when companies like Calphalon will get a clue???.
The food comes out roasted, moist, and ready to eat.
I am glad I bought this item when I bought the pan.
I bought the Granite Ware 0511-3 Covered Rectangular Roaster 21.25 by 14 by 8 1/2 Inch and this rack fits in it nicely.
The way it's shaped, I can roast a small chicken or a big Turkey on it easily.
If you were going to have a turkey bigger than 22 lbs or so, I might get a bigger rack.
However, the way it's shaped, you can fit a ton of veggies in the bottom to cook with the bird.
I can put it into one of my glass sheet pans and don't have to separate the meat from the drippings.
Or I can cut up some potatoes and spread them under the rack.
I absolutely love my Calphalon pots, so I know I will love this roasting rack for our chicken dinners.
Wish I had all of these wonderful things years ago.
I'm sure a chicken would be an easy clean up compared to just setting it in the pan.
I've been looking for the perfect roasting rack for some time now and this is it.
It's heavy weight and the entirely covered in a smooth, non-stick coating.
The lifting handles are fixed in place but quite generous, allowing room for an oven mitt on your hand.
I really like that the "ribs" are thick but widely spaced.
They still support your food well but fewer "ribs" are easier to clean when you're done, although it is dishwasher-safe.
If the size works for you, I think you'll be happy with this reasonably priced, well-designed rack.
A sturdier, better designed rack would be hard to find.
Cooking meat spatters, so almost every inch of this rack is covered with grease.
My best advice is to find someplace where you can let it soak in hot, soapy water for a few minutes.
Then use a nylon pad, and keep turning the rack to make sure you've got all the surfaces clean.
It's easy to miss something when you're dealing with this sort of design.
Let's face it, at this price, this rack is a bargain any way you look at it.
Just expect to spend a little extra time and effort on the cleaning.
This &quot;skillet&quot; is just the right size if you are single and likes to cook.
I find it just the perfect little wok to whip up something for dinner.
The skillet is heavy anodized aluminum with a seemingly very sturdy non-stick coating.
The heavy stainless lid only adds to the heft and quality of the set.
It sits on my small electric burner unit very well and heats up nice and hot in no time.
Use non-metallic cooking utensils and never put it in the dishwasher and it will last a long time.
for omelettes it ispure perfectionwithout the cover, it is slightly unbalanced but not really bothersome on larger burners.
The heavy and gorgeous cover balances this pan very solidly.
This Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 2-Quart Chef's Pan with Lid is a &quot;collector's item&quot; from the newer line of Calphalon's nonstick cookware.
Thus, it has the same alloy aluminum pan as the older &quot;Professional nonstick&quot; line, but its interior has the superior Commercial nonstick coating.
Its handle is &quot;stay-cool&quot; sculpted stainless steel, instead of an older chrome-covered iron handle that can get very hot to the touch.
Since Calphalon rarely offers such deep discounts, especially on their newest nonstick line of cookware, it seems worthwhile to add it to one's collection.
If you have not tried a Commercial nonstick pan, I recommend this one as a test pan.
I have two flat-bottomed woks (Joyce Chen and Calphalon), but they do not work that well on an electric range, and they are not nonstick.
This chef's pot is useful for a small-to-medium stir fry on either a gas or electric burner.
Any residue can be removed with a nylon scrubber and Soft Scrub.
I have had some of these Commercial nonstick pans for four years, and they still look like new.
This is the perfect pan for a single person or two-person household because it is a small size.
I like the tall sides and use it for stir-frying small batches.
It has a good weight, the handle stays cool, and the non-stick interior is extremely easy to clean.
(Just be sure to use non-metal utensils and don't put it in the dishwasher).
I use it so often that I leave it on my stove, ready to go.
A great bargain at this price, it's a very good way to try out Calphalon's Commercial Non-stick line of cookware.
This piece isn't the quality of the USA made Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware, but it's also not the price.
It is also far too small to be used as a wok, as others have suggested.
It is great for carmelizing onions and similar tasks.
Anoher reviewer noted that dimensionally, this pan is very close to sauciers from All-Clad and Cuisinart.
It is a superbly capable piece that will not disappoint the experienced cook.Construction and finish are excellent.
In a side by side comparison with a recent Toledo made 9" skillet, I note no difference in weight or any meaningful difference in finish.
They tote this aa a skillet, but you would have to one hamburger or a smallish pancake in his.
I use this pan for everything, since I am quite happy my 2 Calphalon skillets, except as a skillet.
I use this pan for saucy or very watery dishes that I would not use a deeper pan for.
It is also, like the entire Calphalon line, very easy to clean.
If you do get a tough mess, might I suggest Dawn Power Scrubber, it is a miracle for dish cleaning.
One of the reasons I first tried Calphalon is for the price.
It is th best out there, awsome product and the deal on them from Amazon are, simply, the best.
Perfect for quick prep veggies to be added to other dishes (for Tyler fans "the aromatics").
I know better, but I put the cold food in the cold pan...it stuck...but it tasted great.
Just enough additional browning to make the left-overs seem like something new...and the couscous improved the second time around.
So you have to scrub a little longer,  what else have you got to do anyway.
The dome shaped lid is a plus, I tend to use it on other pans as well.
I never use metal utensils in any pans, only wood or the nylon type implements.
Creuset, Calphalon, and Kitchenaid make some fine implements.
I have been trying to make Hollandase Sauce without having it separate on me for years.
This pan was the one I managed to do it with.
Certain sauces and foods require precise cooking temperatures, and keeping them consistant.
It is however great for blending sauces, vegetables, cooking eggs, and other quick stove top creations.
The secret of these pans seems to be the even heating they do consistantly.
Even though this is not a non-stick version, most food will not stick to it readily.
You can make a sauce, rinse it out, and boil a few eggs in it.
It's the perfect pan for taking care of all the little chores, as need in preparing a big meal.
It is perfect for those large batches of spinach and stir-fry  vegetables and meals.
And clean-up is a breeze! I can't live without it.
I'm a Calphalon convert! The price, quality and &quot;useability&quot; of the commercial hard anodized line are incomparable.
These are made in China which is of little negative consequence to the attributes I've mentioned.
I'm a retired mechanic, so my hands may be less sensitive to heatt than others may be.
Great cookware!  Bought for my daughter for Christmas.
I LOVE the Calphalon Commercial line of cookware.
I purchased this "odd" size pan on sale, to jump start my fancy shmancy cookware collection.
But I can't have nice things because I am a five-alarm kind of cook, who tests the smoke detector regularly.
Soon after I bought this, I boiled water for something and forgot all about it.
It's the baby cereal pan, and never gets put away.
I prefer it to my Triply Stainless pans, because it's easier to clean.My only complaint is the handle; it's short and thin.
I am a GUY learning to cook on his own.
I have gotten hooked on Calphalon, and I have bought them all on Amazon.com.
I feel strange describing a pot as &quot;fun&quot;, but I love this pot.
It is easier to use than several others, and the rounded bottom is great for just about everything.
I marked it down one star because it does stain somewhat and occasionally takes some scrubbing.
This is not a big criticsm from a fellow who is 6 months out from eating canned tuna fish with a fork from the can.
Now I make curried tuna, among other things, in this baby.
The way to collect Calphalon is slowly, one at a time, on Amazon.
This Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 2-Quart Chef's Pan with Lid is a &quot;collector's item&quot; from the newer line of Calphalon's Hard-Anodized cookware.
Since Calphalon rarely offers such deep discounts, it seems worthwhile to add it to one's collection.
Because it has the rounded chef's shape, I would use it for stir-frying, reducing sauces, and making demi-glace.
I have two flat-bottomed woks (Joyce Chen and Calphalon), but they do not work that well on an electric range.
This chef's pot works well for a small-to-medium stir fry on either gas or electric burners.
Using a pan spray is not a good idea because it can leave behind a sticky residue.
Hand-washing is recommended, with use of Bon Ami or Dormond cleaner for any stubborn stains.
The extra caution is why this piece only gets...4 mojo*z!!!But we really do like it and use it a lot.
I think some of the criticism of this pan stems from the name used here -- Chefs' skillet.
The shape and size of this pan is almost exactly the same as a couple of open saucier pans from All Clad and Cuisinart.
I own those pans and use them constantly.
I found the aluminum to be much more responsive to heating changes I made on the burner.
So I have never had any burning or scorching of my sauces.
It is a little wider than the stainless sauciers and this made reductions a bit faster.
They did a head to head test of several major brands of saucier's.
This was not included in their study but it would certainly have ranked at the top.
I use this skillet all the time, greate for everyting.
I used my pan last night for the first time, I made a stir fry.
The pan handles very well, Heats up fast and is a great size.
I can see now that I will be useing this pan alot.
What a great addition to our Calphalon collection.
I prefer the anodized over non stick except for eggs, as the surface is so tough.
I was a bit unsure about the size of this pan.
Not all pots and pans need to be huge and this can hold more than one would think.
I got this pan for free with my Amazon gift certificates from doing surveys.
I have to say it is very stylish-looking and works well for sauces and heating things at an even temperature without sticking.
It cleans up fairly well but takes a bit of scrubbing.
As one would expect of Calphalon, this pan is of utmost quality.
It heats evenly, cleans easily, and best of all it is relatively inexpensive.
The only downside to this pan for me was its size.
It is quite small!  I have been hard pressed to find a dish/meal to prepare in this pan that would feed more than one adult.
The cooking surface of this pan is just too small for most all of my needs.
I guess next time I will buy a 12" or larger chef's skillet!.
This pan is particularly useful for cooking small portions of veggies -- like carmelizing onions or sauteing a package of sliced onions.
Just coat the pan with a light swish of olive oil, fired it up and stir.
Deglaze with some vermouth or madeira wine, and you've got a great side dish.
Also, you will find your food will stick less if the pan is preheated and if the food isn't ice cold when tossed in.Enjoy!.
I'm a serious putterer in the kitchen, jealous of those great Better Homes and Gardens kitchens stocked with all the finest equipment.
When I saw this skillet at such a low price, I had to have it.
It is simply amazing to see the difference a good pan makes.
You can literally see and hear the heat transfer in a nice, solid sizzle.
Cleaning is easy, even after some browning action everything comes out perfect with a little ajax.
But I love to use it for making sauces.
This is not a non-stick pan!  Read the documentation that comes with it, and you should have no problems.
Calphalon is great about making sure you know how to use the pan and how to clean it.
This ultra-thick pan spreads heat out very uniformly, even more than cast iron (!), and it holds a ton of heat in its thick metal.
This means you can heat it up empty on the stove, then do a really really hot stir-fry in it with no trouble.
It's non nonstick, but it's not very sticky and it cleans up very easily by hand.
But if you don't mind hand-washing, it's a super pan.
Dishwasher safe and may use an abrasive cleaner.
Not the quality of the USA made Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized cookware, but also not the price.
A good quality saucepan with lid that is in service daily.
I love this pan, and it may become my favorite.
I recall seeing a handle cover for sale.
I can handle this, I just thought future buyers should know 1st.Its first use was Italian sauteed chard, with garlic and rosemary and olive oil.
It sauteed, then steamed, this dish quite well.
Second most used pot in my kitchen arsenal.
I like this pot for cooking veggies and making pudding for Cream Pies.
My daughter uses only this pot for 'cooking' Ramen Noodles and mac and cheese.
I do agree with the one review I read, this is a little small, but it is still a great little pot.
It also, as with all Calphalon, comes clean easily.
I ended up with Bannanna Cream Pot, UGH.
But, i was able to easlily clean the mess, with a little help from dawn Power Scrubber.
Get this stuff, it is amazing on pots, skillets and bakewre.
it's a good pan, but keep in mind that it's not as good as advertised.
I would give it 2-3 years of regular use in a normal house.
But this still is my go-to pan for many things.
This is the best pan I've ever bought.
On sale for $19.99, you'll want as many pieces as you can get your hands on!  NOTHING sticks to this.
A great deal (and I paid $5 more than it's priced now) on a useful pot.
Also, because of the large surface area cools off quickly when you turn off the heat (great for cooling sauces).
After trying it over Thanksgiving I packed away several longterm pots.
I first purchased the 12 quart Commercial Anodized and was very happy with it.
This 2 1/2 quart size has worked wonderfully.
I made rice in this pan at least 5 times and it turned out perfect.
Mac & Cheese from scratch did NOT stick also made a small batch of fudge in this pan.....Cleanup is a breeze and is oven safe.
There is a slight color variation from the ones made in the USA.
This pan is a workhorse in my kitchen, I use it for vegtables, steaming and sauces.
The pan cleans easily, for example yesterday I cooked alfredo sauce in it.
If you want a saucepan to last a lifetime, this is it! The first time I used it, I was very impressed.
I cooked spaghetti sauce in it and it cooked well and cleaned up superbly.
I can't say enough about the quality of this pan.
And for this price you can't go wrong.
I've gone through so many "nonstick" pans that started to peel and decided to buy this pan.
I will only buy Calphalon commercial from now on.
Foods do not stick to this pan like stainless ones do.
Heats evenly, a perfect addition to my Calphalon family.Great for cooking, I use mostly for making large quantities of rice and it works beautifully.
Perfect for soups, rice, stews, and large quantity meals.
This product provides a high-quality, heavy-duty saucepan at a great value.
The short, shallow style of the pan is perfect for making sauces or browning onions/meats.
I have been using this saucepan for a couple of months and I truly love it! It is easy to handle/clean and sturdy.
I am absolutely in love with this pot.
Only warning is not to put it in the dish washer.
I accidentally put the lid in the washer and it discolored (got white spots everywhere).
I am very happy I got it and will try to get the set.
All 3 are excellent quality and perform just as the manufacturer states.
My dad got this for me 2 years ago.
It still looks like it's brand new! It's not teflon-coated, but it's still nonstick.
I have a feeling i'll be keeping this guy for a looooong time.
Also, the metal handle on the lid doesn't get hot somehow, which is perfect.
I have been buying a lot of the calphalon as it goes on sale here and there on amazon.
this pot is a nice size as it is a bit shallower then my other 2.5 qt.
will be good for sauces and small saute jobs I think.
I bought mine about 6 months ago and absolutley love the thing.
You'll need a pot holder when things really get hot, but all in all, I love this thing.
It has held up well to 6 months of almost daily use, and I expect it will last a lifetime.
Although I've had this pan for a few years, I don't use it that often.
I have several other pans of the same capacity but for those times when I need a wide mouth pan, this one can't be beat.
I also love the heft of this pan.
It's not too heavy but it has a good weight.
I love Calphalon products and ordered this saucepan as an addition to my everyday cookware.
It is a great saucepan/saute pan and has a fairly large cooking surface.
With a little oil, sauces do not stick plus it heats and cools quickly.
I'm actually back to buy my 2nd piece of Calphalon; the price here at Amazon is fantastic!  Buy it, you won't regret it.
Especially good for making hot cereals, boiling eggs, and fixing packaged, mashed potatoes.
This pan does all the little stovetop jobs fast.
The lid is, unfortunately flat, and has a cast steel, grip handle on it.
This works to prevent sticking, when preparing foods without a lot of water.
It only sticks if you forget to stir the food, and leave it too long over the heat.
Before the days of the microwave, the most frequent pans in our kitchen were the small saucepan, and the medium fry pan.
Your canned soups, beans, vegetables, hash, and most of your basic serving items were all designed for a pan of this size.
If you want something you'll get a lot of use out of, get this pan you'll never regret it!.
I love all my calphalon pots, pans, and bakeware.
Best set I have every owned or used.
I paid $24.99 for this when I bought a few other pieces.
Got free shipping & $25.00 off the order.
I purchased this pan about two years ago even though some of the reviews complained because things stuck to it.
The pan has held up amazingly well and looks brand new.
I have had one of these since 1981.
When I saw this product at $30, I wanted to buy all of them, but just bought one.My original will last another 30 years.
I have a back up just in case.
I don't know why I'll ever need it.Seriously, if you can buy this monster for $30, buy a bunch and give them away.
This is the best pan ever for searing, sauces and whatever you want to do.
I haven't used this to cook down a sauce yet.
This heats up much quicker than a stainless steel saucepan and water dries very quickly so good for fast hard boiled eggs.
This is a great saucepan &#8211; good and sturdy and thick with a wide, shallow bottom that distributes heat evenly.
It&#8217;s perfect for thickening sauces and making reductions and we get an intense flavor reducing a vegetable broth for the base of a vegetable stew.
Even though the pan is NOT non-stick, it will clean easily with soap and hot water.
This is one heavy-duty pan that will last you a lifetime.
It just does not change, still looks the same after I used it for couple of years.
Does not have the nonstick coating that you have to worry about.
very nice sauce pan i used yesterday all the long and it was easy to clean.
Reviews should be directed at the product, rather than being a display of anger at some retailer.
It is rediculous not to screen out such reviews as inappropriate.
Very pleased with the quality of this pan, good weight and cooks food evenly, clean up is easy too.
Calphalon is one of my favorite pans because of the quality.
This particular one is perfect for large ampints of vegetables.
Because of it's shape, it eliminates the problem of the food at the bottom getting done before the food at the top.
I have purchased three of these pans, gave one to my best friend and kept two for myself.
I think I use at least one of them everyday, sometimes both are in use.
It's just the perfect size for sauces, vegetables or just about anything.
I use glass tops from other, older Calphalon pieces and it works perfectly.
This is really a wonderful 2 1/2 qt pan!  Very well made - heavy duty.
I use it for cooking scalloped potatoes, rice dishes, vegetables, you name it.
It's the perfect size for cooking side dishes for a family of 2-4 people.
The flatter bottom gives much better heat distribution throughout the food.
I use this pot at practically ever dinner I prepare.
With proper care it has held up beautifully and is easy to clean.
Don't let the rather odd description put you off...this is little pot is a workhorse with an unbeatable price!.
I've been using the Hard-Anodized 2.5 Qt shallow pan now for about a month.
I'm getting a couple more, one for a gift.
It's a good size for all but the biggest meals/ingredients, and it cooks quickly at medium temps.
I've cooked rice in a 3-4 times and it does wonders for 2 cups of rice.
I've also made my own barbecue sauce in it.
This product is a perfect size for preparing frozen vegetables, soups, canned stews and chili.
The quality is excellent; it's finely finished and looks as though it will last a lifetime.
This pot is a handy size, it heats up quickly, and holds the heat evenly.
I just wish it was a bit more deep.
I am sometimes limited in the things in which I can make in this pan due to the depth.
With that being said, it is overall a great pan.
It heats evenly, is nice and heavy and of great quality.
Why did I wait so long!! These pans are great, especially at these close out prices.
I had been concerned about the weight but that has not been a draw back.
Clean up is fairly easy, which is great since these pans cannot go into the microwave.
Heat transfer is excellent, the food warms up fast and I have not been bothered by hot spots from my gas stove.
This is a handy size for smaller amounts.
My wife didn't know if she would use this much but she seems to grab it first for many dishes.
Great for rice and whenever it calls for a heavy duty pot in the recipe.
She uses it all the time for gravy and rue's.
Sticking is a none factor and cleans nice.
I used this Calphalon pot quite a lot, for an assortment of uses.
Most often I use it for boiling pasta, making spaghetti sauce and making rice in.
I usually rinse it out, soak it in water for 20 minutes, then clean it with a soft sponge.
I have never had to use it, but it's nice to know its there should any of my pots and pans go bad.
One thing to keep in mind - putting these pots and pans in the dishwasher will void the warranty!.
If you're like me, you might have missed the part where Calphalon says not to put this pot into the dishwasher.
Oops! What happens is the soap does something to the aluminum, not sure what, turning it white and dry-looking.
I contacted Calphalon about this and was told that I had voided the warranty on the pot and there was no way to fix it.
Same story when I visited a Calphalon retail store.
Sadness ensued.But then I noticed that I had gotten some olive oil on the lid, quite by accident.
Where ever the olive oil was, the white dried-out patina wasn't.
So I wiped the entire pot down with a paper towel and olive oil.
Warranty? I don't need no stinkin' warranty! I have olive oil!The most complicated thing I make in this pot is rice.
Over medium-high heat, I put in some olive oil and chopped onions.
When the onions are translucent, I add a cup of rice and stir it all around.
When it starts to smell like popcorn, I then add a cup and a half of chicken broth and a pinch of saffron.
I admit that I cheat and look before the 15 minutes are up.
The pot is light in weight and easy to clean, even if you have to do it by hand.
It is a necessary addition to any kitchen.
In fact, we have 3 and they all get used constantly.
On first receipt, I was impressed with the heft of this pan.
It is solidly constructed and the handle feels comfortable.
It heats evenly and quickly and the anodized surface makes it easy to work with and to clean.
One note, it is recommended that these pans be hand-washed.
Calphalon products conduct heat for cooking better than any product I have ever used.
I am lifetime fan and will continue to add to my Calphlon collection.
I gave away all of my other cookware.
I love this pan I have been using now for about a month and had no problems.
Love this pan, most foods do not stick, its easy to clean.Starchy foods such as rice may stick a little.
I must say, Calphalon passed the test!  It was very easy to clean, and the sauce turned out beautifully.
Somehow Calphalon products affect the outcome of everything cooked in them.
I don't know why that is, but I do know I'm very happy to have a kitchen stocked with Calphalon.A word of warning, though.
If you buy one piece, you'll definitely fall in love, and want to buy more.
There's no better time than now to check out Calphalon, with Collector's Edition pieces.
I'm noticing that nearly every purchase I've made of Calphalon has sold out shortly after I bought it.
Seize the moment, and put this in your cart now, before it's too late!.
i use a variety of pot and pans but i love love love calphalon commercial hard-anodized pots and pans.
tney are not nearly as non-stick as they might like you to believe but they are better than stainless steel counterparts.
this particular pan is good for what it is designed to do, be a sauce pan.
you are dealing with 90 degree edges so don't expect to use a spatula to flip stuff in this.
Great!  Bought as a gift for my grown daughter.
I have owned Calphalon exclusively for 6 years.
The hard anodized is not a nonstick but you can scrub them with out worry, they clean up beautifully.
First off, I love this pan & I would buy another in a minute if I needed it.
It does everything it's supposed to do as other reviewers have noted.
Since I don't hang my pans, its exterior appearance is not of great concern to me, so I am happy with it.
I also am admittedly hard on my cookware.
I never put them in the dishwasher, but since my kids wash the dishes, nothing is sacred.
It also is starting to chip around the upper outer edge, which I can see eventually spreading to other areas.
However, for $25 on Amazon's Lightening Deal, everyone should own one of these!.
I love this pot- It's the first peice of Calphalon I've bought, and I'm impressed.
The shape is super usefull for old skool Creole cooking with a sear, a roux, and a seasoning gravy- dinner for four is a snap.
We did a nice trout minuere last evening.
Yeah, I'm getting the everyday pot for these things, but every body fights over this pot it's so good.
The stiff nylon bristles have never scratched anything I've used it on but they'll clean a pot like a hounds tooth.
It is my absolute favorite pot for making sauces and stews, and I use it often.
I take very good care of it, and in return it still looks almost as new as when I bought it, 3 years ago.
I love the even heating, sturdy handle, and the hefty weight.
Using Calphalon cookware took some getting used to, however, now I would not cook with anything else.
I keep adding to my cookware and soon will have nothing but Calaphon.This particular saucepan is a great size for many different applications.
It is not going to last forever - but, if you deglaze it before washing, it will last for a long time.
I also like the size of this pan - great when you are cooking for up to 6 people.
At $30 per pan one can hardly expect more.
Good surface for reducing sauces and space enough for two servings.
WOW!  I had no idea what I'd been missing!I recently purchased this and three pieces in the pro line of Calphalon.
I gave this a four start rating because I appreciate the weight and durability of the Pro line the best...more utilitarian in it's design approach.
You won't be disappointed!  Great purchase price..and you can't beat Amazon.com's quick, wonderful and dependable service!Linda.
This pan is a great size for cooking wild rice and curry rice dishes.
Clean up should be by hand, as washing in the dishwasher will pit the anodized finish, but it's not a problem.
I love this pan so much that I just bought my second one!Follow-up:  I now own three of these beauties.
They are absolutely fabulous!  This saucepan is my first choice for whatever I'm cooking.
They stay looking beautiful if cared for adequately.
And the price just can't be beat!  Best rice pan I've ever used.
Care for it as recommended and I can't imagine you'd be disappointed!.
This is the first piece that I have purchased from any of the Calphalon line(s), and I just love it.
It is heavier than I am used to, but it cooks evenly, and the clean up is a breeze.
I have ordered a second one of these pots, as well as 2 of the smaller sized sauce pans as well.
I will definately purchase more in the future.
Do not dispair!!  I discovered a cleaner made by Calphalon, that is slightly abrasive, and it does remove anything, even grease, watermarks, and so forth.
I use mine daily, and they are very much worth the great prices listed here.
I should never have to purchase cookware again, with the exception of my making more purchases to add to my ever growing collection!!.
I have used this pot almost every day since I got it.
I've used it for a variety of things, oatmeal, vegetables, etc.
So far, I have not had a problem at all with cleanup.
It cooks great, and I would highly recommend it.
This shallower version of that same pan (with a larger diameter base) will be perfect for a saut&#x17D;, such as making a mirepoix.
This pan is heavy, build to last and quite versatile.
I highly recommend it :)  Still one of my favorite pan after all these years...4/25/13 update: still using it, still one of my favorites :).
I recently got this pan, and I LOVE it.
I actually bought the little pot with no lid :( and bought the "everyday" pan today.
I don't own much expensive cookware, although I wish I could afford it.
This seems to be the perfect compromise.The handles are sturdy metal (which can go into an oven without fearing the temp like with plastic).
The lids fit well and also have metal handles.
On my gas stove they heat up amazingly fast compared to my old crappy pots.
I already have the stainless tri-ply version of this pan.
I use this size and shape pan frequently because I make french style sauces daily.
The low shape makes it easy for me to whisk in ingredients and to do reductions.
I used the recipe for Coq au Vin that came with the pot.
The recipe called for stove top preparation and completion in the oven.
I've had this pan for a month and I'm very happy with it.
Unfortunately as this line is being discontinued this pan is one of the very few items available here at amazon or elsewhere so get yours.
In my opinion the differences are only in appearance but not in functionality.
It's almost non-stick and I love the handle, iron?? I don't know.
The handle's cool V- design is made to never get hot and it NEVER does.
Never used a mit with this one!! And used metal utensils all the time.I use it a lot for rice and little side dishes.
Cleaning is a breeze, just a little soak if sticky and you're done!! I love it..would buy another except that I'm switching to cast iron!.
In all honesty,we probably wouldn't have bought this pan exceptfor the price.
The heavy weight of this pan keeps things from burning.
I paid 29.99 for mine and thought that was good.
For 30 dollars I am very pleased with this purchase.
As have been mentioned, it is a little low in height, but its volume is it's volume and it can be deceptive.
But the quality of the pot is wonderful.
It's heavy, and it's aluminum which Alton Brown tells me is not as good as copper but better than stainless steel.
The riveting is strong, and handle is all metal allowing it go into the oven or under the broiler at 500f.
This Saucepan is just the right size to heat 6-8 Franks, make Marinara for 2-4 people, noodles for a casserole and many more such chores.
It heats very uniformly and washes up with a soft sponge or rag and soap.The Lid fits precisely reducing the chance to "boil it dry".
We are very pleased with this Saucepan and highly recommend it to all, who love to cook.
This is a real workhorse in the kitchen.
I use this one for white rice, Pasta and heating canned veggies, gravy and so on.
The handles are rivetd, not spot welded which means this pan will last forever.
I Have never had any complaints with the surface of these pans, although you cannot put them in the dishwasher cleaning is always a snap.
I love the weight of Calphalon as well.
The pans always heat evenly and there are no hot spots.
Your great grandchildren will be fighting over this pan someday.
Bought this pan (at full price) 3 yrs.
ago on the advice of my sister & have used it constantly ever since.
This is the older line of Calphalon Commerical hard anodized cookware, used to be its most expensive line & is excellent.
I've read previous reviews & am surprised people have such trouble w/food sticking.
Just follow the cookware directions & food won't stick (e.g., warm pan a little, then add oil/liquid or food.
If u follow these directions, clean up is easy, or requires a simple soak of hot water for 1 min., no big deal.
But, unlike Teflon pans, you can put this pan in the oven up to 550 degrees.
I've used this pan for loads of scrambled eggs.
Perfect generous size to saute veggies for 2-6 people.
A little staining or discoloration is common for all hard anadozied cookware, so this isn't a flaw, but rather common to the line.
Does the job well and is built like a tank - it will take a lot of abuse.
I got my first one of these a few months ago and it truly impressed me.
I can almost understand how a person would pay the $105 list for one of these.
Fotunately you don't have to spend anywhere near that.
Even fast heat, a different but extremely practical shape and built like a tank.
I have only one regret, I should have bought seven.
Like all of the Calphalon pieces I've purchased, this one is excellent--nice size for just about anything.
After cooking rice, I see shadows of the grain outlines and haven't been able to get those off.
It is a reasonable weight and easy to manipulate.The stay-cool handle really does stay cool on the stove.
I've only burned myself a few times like this, and have learned to rest a potholder on the handle after removing it from the oven.
It is not non stick slow and low is the rule.
If stuck on food, a couple hour soak will wipe out with ease.
Use any utensil it seems indestructible so far.
This was my first Calphalon purchase, and my first ever commercial anodized aluminum pan.
I am extremely pleased with  the quality of this pan's construction - this pan is HEAVY duty.
I highly recommend this pan and predict that I will be buying many more pans in this product line in the future.
This Calphalon Saucepan is an added piece to my collection of the hard-anodized line I currently have.
I recommend this cookware to anyone who demands quality and great looks as well as ease of use.
Since Calaphon almost never makes significant discounts on their higher end lines, this saucepan is a great deal.
It has a heavy gauge bottom that provide nice even heating.
It has a high grade Hard Anodized (not non stick) surface which will withstand the use of metal utensils and last for years.
Non stick cookware will not last a lifetime - more like 5-10 years if you use nylon utensils.
Once the surface flakes you should throw the pan out.Hard anodized is a different type of treatment altogether.
It does not stick or burn like regular steel pans but it is not an oil free surface either.
You can use metal utensils without damaging the cooking properties of the surface and they will last a lifetime.
Professional quality, hard anodized pan are usually priced at 2-3 times the price of a good quality non stick set.
If you are looking for an annodized pan this size, this is it.
Buy one now!I got one for my mother-in-law and she loves it too.
was smaller than I had imagined but then its my own fault for not really paying attention-nice sturdy pot-plan to give as a housewarming gift.
It is a top quality saucepan that is perfect for making professional quality sauces or small batches of soups.
I like this saucepan because of the design.
The shorter rounder design causes the flame to stay under the pan and things heat up faster.
Clean up is a little deceiving because when the pan is wet, food particles are hard to see.
That really should be more than enough information to convince you.
It's made of that thick, tough, beautiful anodized aluminum that Calphalon is famous for.
The rivets on the handles are industrial tough.
It will last forever, transfers heat beautifully, and looks great hanging from my pot rack when I'm not using it.
If you like Calphalon, this saucepan is as useful as anything you'll have in your collection.
Calling it a &#34;shallow&#34; saucepan is a bit of a misnomer.
It's 2-1/2 quarts which is large enough for my purposes.
I have become a big fan of Calphalon Hard-Anodized pans.
Once you get the hang of them sticking food is not an issue and they clean up easily.
I'll never buy another non-stick pan again!  This pan is really thick and takes a while to warm up, but once there it's awesome.
This isn't a top of the line sauce pan but it very well may be the top of the line in terms of value.
I've never been disappointed with any piece of cookware from Calaphon and this little sauce pan is no different.
It has an excellent stick-resistant surface (although not non-stick) making for quick and easy cleanup.
The heat is distributed well throught the entire pan.
Best of all this one is really a great bargain on Amazon right now and you really can't go wrong for the price.
What you don't bake on, you won't have to scrape off.
I'm a late convert to Calphalon, but I have to say that this saucepan did the trick.
Right from the start I felt a difference in the way I needed to approach the dish.
There were no hot spots so I wasn't constantly trying to scrape up the congealed bits of soup or sauce so they wouldn't burn.
A simmer really is a simmer, not a potential low boil or a cooling-off period.
Cooking with quality cookwear really does make a difference.
I can't recommend this enough, though with one important caveat: These pots weigh a ton when filled.
This might be a problem for someone who doesn't have a degree of strength in arms and hands.
I thought that the handle would get hot but was pleasantly surprised and I would recommend this item due to it's great price and quality!.
I find myself using this saucepan over and over again.
The surface is non-stick:  I've only had to use cooking sprays with recipes which needed to simmer undisturbed for an extended time.
This sauce pan is great for a small family.
It is truly non-stick and is easy to clean inside and out.
The lid matches and is easy to clean as well.
The only thing that would have improved my rating is for a glass lid so I can watch the food as it is cooking.
They cook evenly and are very easy to clean.
Whether you are making a sauce or heating up soup these saucepans are a must have in your kitchen.
This was such an excellent buy that I bought one for my kitchen and one for my daughter's kitchen.
What fun when making and serving soups, chile, and stews to the crowd.
I really like this casserole and have had great success with everything that I have made using it.
For the price you should not expect this to be like the heavy commercial pots that Calphalon once made.
I do like how it cleans up so easily and it conducts heat quite well.
I bought a few of them to give as gifts.
Great pot, heavy, but not too heavy, cleans easily and a good size for most soups, stews etc.
I finally bought one of these for myself, I should've done it long time ago.
I use it so much, sometimes I don't even put it away and use it even for "smaller" jobs.
It is great for soups and stews, I boiled corn and potatoes in it.
I even put the whole pot on the outside grill when it was too hot to cook inside, the gulash came out great.
This casserole is Made in China and it is great quality.
I just recieved this Chef's Casserole...I LOVE IT.Tonight I made a French Pot Roast,it was great.
I am absolutely delighted with my Chef's Casserole.
I had a recipe for Pulled Pork and tried it in a teflon pot that I had on hand.
After looking for a large "Dutch Oven" in local stores with no luck, I found this item on Amazon.
I made the recipe again and couldn't have been more pleased with the results.
The meat cooked evenly and clean-up was a snap.
The size of the pot enables me to cook larger portions than ever before, for large gatherings or freezing.
This is a great pot!  I now have two of them.
One for home use and the other for the weekend away at the cabin or family reunion.
The domed lid is especially nice for the big pot roast or chicken with all those vegetables.
This is a great additon to my Calphalon cookware.
The design, size and shape of the pan are great.
I was somewhat disappointed to find the quality not the same as the other calphalon pans I've purchased in the past from Amazon.
This pan was much thinner, and was also made in China, not USA as the previous ones I bought.
The handle on the lid is also stainless steel, and the shape has been redesigned to allow for easier lifting.
Also, I don't put any of the Calphalon pots or pans in the dishwasher.
Great pot......cooks evenly, cleans up nicely and works well on ceramic cooktops.
Added bonuses are that it's very light weight and it cleans up in a jiff.
It does seem thin, but it is a good quality pot.
Just what I was looking for to go well with our other Calphalon pieces on the pot rack.
I purchased this new piece because I had been looking for a unique size and what a great buy.
I recommend this cookware to anyone and especially for the price Amazon had it offered for.
Are you kidding me? 87% off??? This may be the greatest deal on Amazon.
This is a nice, big casserole, both deep and quite wide.
The heat seems to carry well throughout the 11 1/2" diameter pan for quick and even heating.
I use it at least a couple of times per week.
Note that it is stick resistant and NOT non-stick.
I still use non-stick spray in it no matter what.
A real workhorse and a great bargain at this price.
I bought this mixer for occasional baking projects, and it is exactly what I was looking for.
No, it's not a top-of-the-line mixer, but it is very inexpensive and works quite well.
One that is a whisker and the other two are your standard kind.
I mainly put it on the low to 2 setting to mix dough.
I think I may have brought it up a couple speeds higher to make mashed potatoes once.
I mainly keep it on the low speed because it is easier to control that way.
I don't have arms of steel so any higher than 3 and I'm fighting to keep it in the bowl.
As another reviewer mentioned (her review is what pushed me over to get this mixer), it is meant for light-duty work.
It can pass off for some medium to heavy duty work but just use your discretion.
Burnt smells = Not good!Another reviewer mentioned chrome flecks in their batter.
I clean my beaters in dishwasher which can't be good for the long term and have used it quite a bit.
I imagine that it may have to do with contact with acidity for a long time?  I will update if anything starts breaking down.
It sometimes takes more than one try to secure them.
I had to buy another one.I liked the features that this one promised so I ordered it.
But it is beautiful!  And it comes with a nice price tag!.
It is inexpensive so I was worried, but I shouldn't have been.
It comes with 3 different sets of beaters that store in a container that the mixer sits on.
Recipient has used it and seems to like it.
It spins and didn't melt! If anything goes wrong I will certainly update this review.
I bought this inexpensive mixer after the beaters broke on my old one and they could not be replaced (it only came with one set).
The Hamilton Beach was only $20 so I took a chance.
I'm glad it has multiple beaters, although I mainly use the thinner, wire ones.
It has lots of power and also has the power-boost feature.
Works great and even if it lasts a couple years, I'll be satisfied!.
I bought it as a quick replacement when mine crashed and found it far superior to the expensive model it replaced.
Has terrific power for its size and its blending capabilities are more than comparable to the bigger Kitchenaids.
Also makes a nice wedding or shower gift, or an inexpensive housewarming gift for a young cook starting out in that first apartment.
bought it for my daughter she loves it especially  the different speeds.
the storage case is a nice and convient.
For an inexpensive hand mixer you can not go wrong with this Hamilton Beach model.
Comes with the proper tools for mixing cake batters, etc.
I can't fit a very large standing mixer in my tiny kitchen, but this is just right and does the same job.
Like many of the other reviews, the low speed is definitely not so low.
I had another one that was 'light' duty, and believe me, it was indeed LIGHT duty!  I would recommend this one to every one.
I use it a couple of times a month and couldn't be happier with the performance.
I have had absolutely no issues with this mixer and expect it will last as long as i do.
I would buy it again and recommend it without hesitation.
This is a great product for the money.
Easy to hold, powerful and I like the  case for storage.
Excellent for preparing boxed cake and cookie mixes, also mashed potatoes.
I have a huge kitchenaid mixer but use it very seldom.
This little hand mixer does the job just fine.
Much, much lighter, quick, easy and works just great.
Recommend 100%, great value, sure beats lifting the monster kitchenaid !!.
Alas, there was nothing like that, just light-gauge wires and springs that popped out.
Just be aware that if you're doing things like mixing heavy doughs, you'd really be better off with a small stand mixer.
I've had this mixer for four years going on five years.
Got it as a gift and I like it.
It gets the job done and I haven't had any issues.
I'm surprised because it's Hamilton Beach and I usually don't like their products.
It is a bit heavy and your hands will get a little tired but I'm getting a stand mixer for that reason.
I'm going to still keep this one also.
I received this mixer as a wedding gift 5 years ago and love it.
But I have been completely satisfied with the quality and performance.
My 20 you hand mixer crapped out, so replaced with this model.
I like the sturdy feel and various speeds for mixing about anything.
easy to handle, compact and easy to clean.
storage feature for the beaters is a nice feature.
I read the reviews here before I bought the mixer.
I usually use it to whip egg whites, eggs, creams, and sometimes mix cake batters.
One thing though, it is kind of heavy for a girl, especially if you have to hold it for more than 15 minutes.
But hey, you get what you have paid for.
Until I get a stand mixer, this is a good temporary substitute.
So I did my research, found this great deal on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.
I purchased this mixer for my mother, after receiving it for Christmas in 2012.
I absolutely love this mixer, the speeds are great, the attachments fit in perfectly and detach easily.
It is the right size to fit in your hand and hold for extended periods of mixing.
I think Hamilton Beach mixers are always of good quality.
I have had this mixer for two years now.
I purchased it to replace one that had lasted me 20 years, and I use it perhaps once a week.
For the money, I think it is one terrific little mixer!  THe pros:1) Does not splatter.
I first bought a different brand and returned it to the store---it splattered a lot.
I have a big stand-up mixer that I would use for things like thicker doughs.
I bought it for our easter ham in the first place and saw it had the best ratings.
For the price I did not expect too much, just an OK knife.
Approximately 7 1/2&#34; to 8&#34; around, where you hold it for use.Electrical cord: Approx.
5 feet.The twin blades mount and eject easily.
I've used it on roast beef, turkey, chicken and pork roast without any problems.
It cuts cleanly and does a nice job producing thick or thin slices of meat.
This is really nice for carving turkey breasts whish I frequently cook.The case, blade cover and carving fork are a very nice bonus.
HE HAS ALWAYS WANTED ONE SO THIS SAVED ME A LOT OF TROUBLE RUNNING AROUND TO STORES AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO GET.
This knife makes the job of cutting bread so much easier.
It takes me less time to slice the bread and my arm doesn't get worn out.
I have had the same electric knife for 20 years and I loved it.
Just recently I noticed it wasn't cutting as well as it had in the past so I came on amazon and purchased this one.
Having said that, I have only used this once and I am still getting used to the feel it.
I have only used this item once to carve a ham.
It made perfect slices and the Amazon price was a bargaign.
I would recomend this product to my freinds, it worked great! The fork that comes with it was also great.
I've never used an electric knife, but this thing went through a Tri Tip roast like nothing.
I was able to cut slices of any thickness I like all the way down to shaved paper thin.The storage container is very nice too.
Sharp and efficient for carving turkeys and prime rib and roast beef the few holidays a year we use it.
Hard to say if it would last for the long haul of weekly use but it is fine for our needs and easy to clean.
We got six good years out of it.
Purchased it in 2006; it &#34;popped&#34; audibly with a burn electric smell the day after Christmas 2013, as I was slicing leg of lamb.
I guess six years is an acceptable run with electric appliances in this day and age.
I guess I'll take it to Goodwill; maybe they can fix it.
At least I can keep the fork, which is a nice one LOL.
The first one was very old and the casing got cracked when it was dropped on the floor.
The knife works fantastic and is easy to use even if you're a novice carving a chicken or turkey.
That doesn't mean it isn't great for carving beef or lamb roasts, but poultry takes more finesse and this knife makes it a snap.
Even if the price wasn't so low I'd still buy this knife because it is that good!.
I use my  Hamilton Beach electric knife to slice homemade bread and can't imagine not having it for that purpose alone.
I gave both my daughters bread makers for Christmas and included this and a recipe book as well.
These are great little knives with holding fork and comes in a nice white plastic case.
Compact carrying case with everything you need inside: knife, blades, and carving fork.
The knife made my cutting chores much easier, and the things I cut: meat, and bread, looked professionally done.
If you're looking for the cleanest, best cut then you shouldn't be using an electric knife.
If you want a fast, good, dependable cut that gets the job done then buy this electric knife.
I think the people giving it a poor review because of the quality of cut are being unfair.
This knife gives a very good cut and considering the price you get the knife, fork, and a case.
It is a good deal!I've been using this for several months now and it has taken the chore out of manually cutting meat.
It does a very good job on all types of meats.
I'm very happy and highly recommend it to anyone that is looking to simplify the chore of cutting meat.
It has done it's job well for us.
I had this one when I first got married 35 years ago.
The knives  can be used without the electric too.
Hamilton Beach 74250 Carve 'n Set Electric Knife with Case is great! I love that it has a fork and a storage case.
It cuts pretty well, but I think that it could be a bit sharper.
easier to cut very thin slices, but I am mostly satisfied with its performance.
The product works well in cutting situations and the box is a great plus.was able to flawlessly cut the the Thanksgiving turkey in perfect slices.
I'm quite happy with the results.It works great to slice my break-maker loaves cleanly -- both thin (for sandwiches) and thicker (for a snack).
It may take a few seconds longer, but you should have no problems with overheating.I've had this for about a month so far.
If anything happens to change my rating, I'll edit and update my review.
But for now, I'm quite happy with this.
My 20-year-old electric knife just recently quit working, so it was time to select a new one.
Why?  After 20 years of searching for the blades in one place, and the knife in another.
and then searching for my fork, it was time for a change.
now everything I need to carve my roast, turkey, or ham is in one spot in the cabinet above my microwave.
I love it!In addition to the case, the knife is everything I need.
enough power and sharp enough to cut whatever meat needs cutting.
So if your 20-year-old electric knife bites the dust, take a look at this one.
You might be just as pleased as I am!.
I haven't had one of these for many years.
This is a very nice set that includes the knife, fork and case.
The cord length is adequate but not too long.
The trigger is a little difficult to press due to the incorporated safety features.
Everything works quite well once you get used to the trigger.
I have used this to carve a large 28 pound Thanksgiving turkey and a large baked chicken.
The slices were absolutely perfect and much thinner and more uniform than when I use a standard knife.
Cleanup was also easy and the case affords easy storage.Amazon is terrific! I always try to buy from Amazon whenever possible.
This is easy to use and cuts beautifully.
I never thought we would go back to a electric knife.
Being older we found it easy to use, but yet it isn't cheap feeling and you feel very secure when using it.
It comes with a blade cover and it has a storage box of it's own.
Would recommend this product and would send it to someone as a wedding gift if requested.
It's been over twenty years since we used one and we are very happy with the price and knife.
Can't beat Hamilton Beach, an old and reliable company.
This knife comes in a very sturdy case and the units functionality is fantastic.
I used it the other night on a large roast and it made very short work of this.
Used it on the Thanksgiving turkey, which made the carving task so easy with beautiful clean and thin cuts.
I love cooking up a brisket now and then but they have a huge amount of fat on them.
A store I used years ago used totrim all the fat off and only charge me for the brisket I was buying.
They opened a new store and won't do that now.
A Publixrecently told me they could trim the fat off but they would then charge me MORE per pound.
Then I had theidea of trying an electric knife.
The handle gets VERY hot while using it so I had to slow down.
I was actually afraid it would burn up the motor.
This made me lower my rating to 4 stars.
I would highly recommend this for those appointed to be the Master Carver at such events.
I assume but am not sure that this is the same knife as the metal finished Hamilton Beach electric knife.
I was looking for the best knife under $20.
Sure, a skilled conventional knife user can carve up a 20 pound turkey quickly.
My previous electric knife was maddening in that regard - it would cut-out repeatedly as my trigger finger shift position slightly.
Hardly anyone goes to the store to buy one for themselves.
It's NOT FOR MEAT CUTTING BONES ETC...soft material only, breads, turkey, pork roasts, cheeses.
It will cut cartilage, but it's not a meat-cutting saw.For $20 bucks, it's worth it and it's light enough not to cost much for shipping.
The box itself has a nice gift presentation as the fork, blades and knife body are enclosed.
Make sure you get at least $0.05 (five cents) from the recipient, as it is considered bad luck to give/get a knife for a present.
When you get the $0.05 it's considered by the superstition god to be PAYMENT, hence bad luck does not apply.
Can't go wrong with this Hamilton Beach.I also have used this knife to cut my homemade soap blocks.
This knife cuts smoothly and is easy to use.
Definitely would recommend this item to my friends.
This is a great little electric knife set.
The knife is powerful, the blades are sharp, and the handy cutting fork and storage box make it a sweet deal.
I've got weak hands and HATE slicing a roast or carving a turkey.
I was cooking a roast and ran out to get this knife, sorry, not here, needed it right then!!  I do recommend it.
I had zero problems with knife, inserting blades, etc.
Case holds all of this in one convenient place.
I've tossed the bladed in the diswasher, just fine.
And this Hamilton Beach did an excellent job.What non-food item, you ask? Foam, as in memory-foam.
From another online vendor, I bought a three-inch memory-foam cover for a king bed.
I did not intend to use it on my bed.I have hard wood floors, and my dogs needed something soft to lie on.
Then I wrapped a sheet around each one for an instant dog bed.
I have had this electric skillet for more than 8 years, and I have never found anything that does a better job of cooking bacon.
Perfect bacon every time, and it does a really nice job on frying eggs.
My temp controls work well enough to use it as a slow cooker as well.
I have yet to see a griddle or electric skillet have more even heating than the HB.
I live in a small apartment and it nestles for storage which really helps.
Just the right size for me as well.
I use it all the time, in fact curry chicken is cooking in it as I type.
It always comes along when we travel by car to timeshare properties or rooms with kitchenettes.
The lid is like new even though it gets banged around the most.
My only dilemma is 'do I order another one in case Hamilton Beach stops making it?&#34;.
Bought this as a gift for my mother for Christmas, she loves it.
I will probably get one for myself now too.
I bought this as a gift for my Dad who loves milkshakes and smoothies.
He loved the retro design with the sidecar.
His only comment was that this is only for a milkshake.
The style of the blender set-up doesn't allow for anything else to be made with it, like a fruit smoothie.
If you want a milkshake maker, this is perfect but don't expect it to work well with much else.
This is the second of these I've had.
THE FIRST LASTED 14 YEARS being used once or twice a week on average.
This one seems to have the same motor and power and it also works really well.
You do have to make sure the ratio is correct when making milk shakes (use more milk than may look necessary).
I actually paid less for this one through Amazon than I did the first one through a retailer.
I am a blood cancer survivor and use this to make Carnation Breakfast Shakes a couple times a week now.
It is also a lot of fun to experiment with.
I know you'll love it as much as I do.
I bought this drink mixer because I love to make milk shakes and other kinds of frozen drinks.
I did read the reviews first and noticed that there were a lot of negative reviews.
I received it in the mail yesterday and make a chocolate shake today.
I was really shocked by the amount of power that this machine had.
I filled the cup about two thirds full and started the machine.
At first, I thought that I was on the high setting because of the amount of power.
This one actually caused the cup to overflow because of the power.
I do not know if they replaced the motor or what Hamilton Beach did, but the machine definately exceeds my expectations.
my son loves it he can make smoothies and milk shakes with this product, it brings back some good memories!!!!.
Have not had a chance to use yet but it style of it is beautiful.
I will be using this in the next week for shakes because my and my family have an open weekend.
Purchased this mixer as a 13th birthday gift to my granddaughter.
She LOVES malts and is delighted she can now make all her sodashop creations with her very own mixer.
I was a little hesitant to order this after reading some reviews saying that it didn't have much power.
It's a great looking mixer and in this chrome color could fit well in a retro or a more modern kitchen.
I bought this to make milkshakes and nutrition drinks for an ailing elderly relative and it does work for that purpose.
However, it is a somewhat underpowered and can't successfully mix/blend anything more than a not-too-thick shake or drink but it did meet my purpose.
It is not heavy-duty (it's all plastic except for the mixing rod and motor) and won't make smoothies or blend frozen fruit.
It's okay and safe enough for kids to use this to make after-school drinks.For the price and purpose, it was just fine for me.
Not only does this make great milkshakes quickly, it also looks great out on a counter.
Hamilton Beach 730C Classic DrinkMaster Drink Mixer, Chrome is a big hit.
four out of five people in our family prefer milkshakes so it is a fun past time when milkshakes are being made.
Smaller version of soda shop mixer but just right size for my kitchen.
Quality product for price! Fun to make malts and milk shakes with it.
I use it to mix almond silk with whey, salsa with no salt tomato paste, a little mayo with a good amount of yogurt.
I bought this with a few hesitations given the mixed bag of reviews.
I love malts and this mixer does a great job of blending everything together WITHOUT liquifying the ingredients like a blender does.
The blending disk is also wavy not smooth as some others said.
It is chrome but for thirty-five bucks, what does one expect.
I've made frappes three nights in row now and they've all come out great.
Just be sure not to use rock hard ice cream.
I use crushed ice so I haven't had a problem with ice.
It's quick and easy to use and I like the cup for filling up pipping tubes.
Four stars because I like a machine that has a heavy feel to it.
It makes a good shake  and it's easy to clean.
So for as much as I'll use it it's fine.
When I was a kid we had one of these and we used it all the time.
It wasn't until long after all the kids left that mom gave the &#34;milkshake maker&#34; away.
The kids have been making milkshakes for themselves and their friends, and even taking it to meetings (scouts etc.) to make milkshakes for everybody.
Their mom and thanked me and thanked me.
Easy enough for children to use and clean up.
And no sharp knives - like there are in blenders - to hurt anybody.
The DrinkMaster is simple to use and to clean up.
Perfect way to let him have a snack without the mess and the fuss.
I'm not the one to cook a lot but I've been making a lot of breakfast foods lately.
Then I found this waffle maker on amazon for $19.99 or so.
I busted it out today and it's perfect.
Like someone else said, follow the instructions for the waffle mix and the waffle maker and everything will turn out fine.
Takes only 5 minutes from time you pour batter to time they're ready to eat.
Also, it's a space saver because it stores upright with the handles facing up toward the ceiling.
It's almost impossible to get less-than-excellent results with this waffle iron, short of wandering away and forgetting the waffles are baking.
Clean up is a cinch! Worked right out of the box.
Only have used it a few times, but its easy and almost foolproof.I'm only using Aunt Jemima or Hungry Jack pancake mix for now.
Tried adding 2 small bananas to the basic recipe.
For that, I needed a spray-on oil, like Pam.
Little booklet does warn you that recipes with extra sugar may require spraying.Wish it had a timer, like some more expensive ones.
Depending on what's in the waffle, it might take a different amount of time to cook.
With bananas thrown into the most basic Aunt Jemima mix, I found the waffles required a bit more time.
But u cant wait til the steaming stops before removing these banana waffles.
I guess the bananas will keep on steaming , long after waffle is already quite golden.
Even tho I've experimented a bit, there's nothing about this machine that's gonna fool u much.
It stores upright, everything is basically good.The booklet does tell u to start with simple stuff and experiment later.
If u have a huge family, maybe u would be better off with an iron that makes 4 at a time.
I previously had waffle irons with removable grids and had trouble with the oil/batter running under the grids and creating a mess.
This one has non-removable grids, which work fine.
I lightly oiled the grids the first time I used it, and have not had to again.
I never wash the grids - just wipe them off and the waffles pop out fine.
I set a timer for 5 and a half minutes and they come out perfectly every time.
The only thing I don't like so much is the shape of the waffles.
Round would fit on a plate a little better, but that's about it.
I've been using the iron every Saturday morning for about 9 months and am very happy with it.
The waffles came out crispy and huge!  The kids love them.
Please take the negative reviews with a grain of salt.
It's obvious that some of them are from people who don't like to read instructions.
First, the indicator lights are NOT supposed to tell you when the waffle is finished.
One light simply tells you the unit is receiving power (i.e., it's plugged in).
The other light tells you when the iron is hot enough to pour in the batter.
The waffle is done in five minutes or when steam stops.
All of that is in the instructions that come with the waffle maker.
My waffles always come out golden brown.You will have no problem with the batter sticking if you use the recipes for waffles, not pancakes.
Waffle recipes include a small amount of cooking oil, which is needed to keep the waffles from sticking.
Every box of mix I've ever purchased has alternate instructions for mixing waffle batter vs.
Again, it's just a matter of reading the instructions.
I had been looking for an easy-to-use waffle maker since getting rid an old old (30+ years) applicance that had been owned by my parents.
And I was a bit skeptical about the "flip and fluff" deal with the Hamilton Beach model.
Add a little bit of vegetable oil and an egg, and you'll get the most delicious waffles!  The flipping thing really works.
Be sure to leave the waffles in long enough for them to get a deep golden brown.
That way, they'll be crispy on the outside and just yummy on the inside.
I love the deep pockets in the waffles, too.....they hold the syrup on the waffles.
The waffle baker is so easy to clean up, and takes so little space to store when standing on end.
I did a lot of research before buying one.
I use the recipe that comes with it and it is yummy! You just plug it in to heat it.
Pour some batter onto the waffle iron, close the lid, and flip it upside down.
What you get is yummy, crispy, evenly cooked Belgium waffles.
I have had mine now for about 6 years and it still works great!.
I got this based on the Amazon reviews.
Usually I am suspicious of mass market brands like Hamilton Beach but this thing really delivers.
This beats frozen organic waffles hands down and is only slightly more trouble.
I have never used one before and for my fisrt time I made a great purchase.
This waffle baker make beautiful, large fluffy waffles.
I don't have a problem with them sticking, just use a spatual to pull them off the iron.
The only reason I don't give this item 5 starts is beacause I wish it had a timer with a bell when done.
It's not a big geal but would be helpful if you're doing other things as well.
You just need to keep an eye on the steam as the book says.
Overall it's an excellent waffle baker and highly recommend it!.
This maker does waffles like the big expensive ones, each and every time.
No timers or other bells and whistles....who cares, just less things to break.
Pour the batter in and watch for five minutes or so.
Bottom line is this waffle maker turns out great tasting, fluffy waffles.
As a bonus, you can feel smart because it is a great bargain as well.
I'm a guy who doesn't know how to cook, or maybe it's just that I'm too lazy to really learn.
But anyway, even I can use this thing.
when green light turns on, spray Pam on, pour in the batter and close it.4.
Eat a delicious waffle.What else do you want in a waffle baker.
It's cheap, it makes two waffles at a time.
Never burned a waffle yet; never get an undercooked one if you wait for the steam to stop.
I have to agree with the almost 100 other reviews, mostly 5 stars, already written about this wonderful appliance.
You need not brush the spray into the "valleys."  You must do this between each addition of new batter to the waffle maker.
The waffles did stick a little but I added a 1/4 of oil instead of 1/3, so that was expected.
- Waffles come out very thick, but not heavy.
Nonstick surface works well as well - waffles don't stick.
I especially like the way it stores upright in the cabinet leaving room for other things.
This waffle maker has been the greatest small appliance I recently ordered.
It is compact, cute and makes terrific waffles.
The flip action is much easier than I thought and the non-stick surface is truly non-stick.
The waffles do not stick at all, and I've used the waffle recipe from the Bisquick box.
We add mashed banana, applesauce, almonds, peanut butter chips and chocolate chips so far (not all together, LOL).
The thickness of the waffles is superb, and my picky son who won't touch a frozen waffle devours these.
The kids want them at every meal.I'd give this little machine 10 stars if I could.
There are a lot of kinds of wafflers: Belgian (make thick square or round waffles), German-style (flat, sometimes heart-shaped) and standard American medium waffles.
I have never used a waffle iron before.
So I thought I would produce several misshapen, ruined waffles as a learning curve.
From the very first waffle of my life, to my intended 'waffle-station brunch', each was perfect.I flipped them, didn't flip them.
BTW - there was not much difference between flipping the waffle iron or not.
Either way they raise high and are beautiful.And for the low price you cannot go wrong purchasing this small appliance.
I have used it nearly ten times in the past two weeks since it arrived.
Sprinkling brown sugar on the batter made a mess of the machine but did taste good.
I havent tried the other recipes in the book but the machine does its job well.
One of the legs did come unglued (as one of the other reviewers noticed too) and so far I've just pushed it back in place.
I bought my husband the &quot;Flip &amp; Fluff&quot; for an X'mas present.
It was a great price and we needed a new waffle iron.
I have to admit that I thought it sounded like a gimmick at first.
We used the included recipe booklet a few times and our own waffle recipes the other few times.
All came out wonderful!  We added oatmeal one time, another time we added chocolate chips and still another time we added blueberries.
They all came out yummy!  We did not have to spray the iron grid at all - the waffles never stuck.
This waffle iron turned out perfect, fluffy waffles with the very first batch.
Turning the iron creates an air bubble, which assures deep, fluffy, yet crisp waffles.
It stores upright in cabinets to save space.
A terrific value for under $24.Addendum 12-02-2010: Three years later, the waffle iron still works perfectly.
I bought three more of them as gifts for friends and relatives.
Unfortunately, Hamilton Beach no longer makes this item, so most likely the only sources will be used ones on eBay.
What a shame, this was a real five-star product for performance and value.
I have never owned a waffle cooker before and I bought this one thanks to all the wonderful reviews on Amazon.
I am absolutely amazed at the excellent waffles I made today!  On my very first try the waffles were just about perfect.
The waffles were enormously thick!  I also beat the egg white separately and I know that helped.
The 2 waffles I made were really delicious and filling.
The little recipe booklet has some receipes that look good and I'll try soon.
I love simply flipping it over and having huge waffles.
What a difference!  I can't imagine ever eating a frozen waffle again.
These waffles were better than any restaurant waffle I've ever had.This product exceeded my expectations.
The truth is, the waffle maker also sits upright on its side and can sit on your counter out of the way until needed.
You may want to keep a mitt nearby incase you feel it is too hot to hold the handle.
Steam also escapes from the unit, so watch for steam when turning the baker.
This item also comes with a small Waffle Baker Recipe Book with recipes for everything from Whole Grain Waffles to Gingerbread Waffles.
You can start with a mix or make the waffles from scratch.
Most waffle recipes can be used in any waffle baker, so feel free to try your own favorite recipe.
Nothing sticks and you never have to worry about how you are going to extract the waffles from the baker.
While the waffle baker can't be taken apart for cleaning, it was easy to wipe the baker clean once it had cooled completely.
I prefer using all-purpose flour from King Arthur Flour.
In a deep medium bowl, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks.
Whites will have tips that stand when the beaters are lifted.
In a large bowl, beat the yolks and sugar.
Then, add the buttermilk, butter, vanilla and vermouth.Sift in the flour, baking powder, salt and soda.
Beat for 1 minute, then gently fold in the egg whites.
If desired, use a pastry brush to apply a thin coat of oil onto the inside of the heated waffle baker.
We also sprinkle them with confectioners' sugar.~The Rebecca Review.
Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I had waffles baking in this nifty little machine.
I only had Bisquick on hand, and it still made the lightest, crispy waffles in only 3 minutes.
I sprayed it with Pam  the first time,and there was no sticking.
When I added sugar to the mix, it took a nudge to get the waffle to release---and it fell right out.
I can't understand what would make some peoples waffles stick.
It stores in very little space---I'm thinking of buying a second one for when I have a big crowd for breakfast on holidays.
They brown very good and and the flipping over is no problem at all.
I love to be able to read the reviews to help me make up my mind.
And you know that with these many reviews this waffle baker has to be good.
Cheap, easy and delicious waffles is what you'll get.
A waffle in a restaurant will be anywhere between $5 and $10.
By the time it reaches your table it will be too cold to melt the butter and will probably be tough.
Solution:  this waffle maker will solve all your problems with short and easy instructions.
I received it yesterday and just had the best waffle ever.
And at the price, you'll break even after 3 or 4 waffles.
I made 6 and so I'm way ahead of the game.
And everyone really liked them--not a dud in the bunch.
This is the best waffle maker I've ever had.
Now I'm looking for another one for flatter waffles for those times when you want a standard waffle.
The waffles turn out thick and fluffy, but the top side doesn't get as brown as the bottom side.
Also, because of the handle design, the steam will easily burn your fingers if you aren't careful lifting the lid.
The non-stick surface works great; no need for cooking spray.
Overall, I like this product and it's good for the price.
Golden Belgian waffles make a breakfast like nothing else in the world.
I've spent years perfecting a recipe to make the most crispy, buttery waffles imaginable.
So you can picture my disappointment when, one Saturday morning, our beloved waffle maker just stopped working.
I immediately jumped on amazon and found a few models that got great reviews.
But it wasn't until it arrived that I realized that it didn't have an adjustable thermostat like its predecessor.
So far, however, this hasn't proven to be a problem - whatever its fixed setting makes perfectly golden waffles.
It has a much smaller profile than our previous one, too, as well as an easier to clean design.
That saying is almost as annoying on reviews as it is on the radio huh.
True none the less, this waffle maker just works.
First time out of the gate, six minutes later produced the perfect waffle.
I used the cheap $1.50 box batter and they tasted great to me.
Feels well built which is always a nice surprise these days.
This is a nice waffle iron for the price.
Cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time.
I've used mine for over a year and like it a lot.
She loves it, and has told me it works great.
This product does it job, a standard single belgian waffle maker.
Nothing particular to note as huge positives or negatives.
I've noticed some reviewers talking about the smell that the machine initially has, and I would agree.
This is a great "add-on" buy for Super Saver Shipping combo if you need a good morning breakfast maker.
Simple rule: always, always oil/grease it up before you pour in the waffle mix.
I usually just brush it down with some vegetable oil, but I'm sure you can use whatever you want.Other than that, it works great.
Easy to use, and always cooks my waffles all the way through without burning them on the outside.
i really liked this product i got it because it was the easiest to use.
Despite its simplicity, it's well made and feels sturdy.
There is a pre-heat light on top that lets you know when the maker is up to temperature, and that's it.
Just plug it in and you're ready to go.It's easy to clean as well.
I use a spray olive oil on mine.
I bought this after reading all the reviews.
I just got this and recently got a chance to use it.
It was extra easy to clean and stands up so it saves space.
This is without a doubt the best waffle maker out there.
I bought this for my wife last year and we use it almost every weekend to make waffles.
The outside of the waffle gets nice and crispy while the inside stays perfectly moist.
The unit heats up quickly and only takes a few minutes to make a waffle.
The best part is how easy it is to clean.
We just run a damn paper towel over it after we are done and it is good to go.
This waffle maker doesn't have any frills which was part of the attraction for my family.
We wanted a durable, good piece of kitchen equipment worth bringing out on the weekends for a hot, sit down breakfast together.
There is no annoying batter dripping off the edges of the grids and no needless clean up.
Our waffle maker wipes clean with a paper towel and nothing else.
With such low maintainence upkeep, I imagine it will last for years and years.It comes with a recipe book which offers serviceable recipes.
We have tried it with gourmet mixes, Krusteaze, as well as Bisquick mixes.
It does a splendid job with all batters.
One waffle fills me up as they are thick and generous.
Bought this for my camper while I am away from home.
If you are feeding more than one person, you should get a double sided one but this works great for me.
When four hungry kids are waiting for waffles it has to go fast.
The weird thing is, one of the irons gets hot faster than the other one.
And makes some super fluffy tasty waffles!! Add your favorite ingredients and bake them right into it.
It was quite affordable, and I am very happy with the purchase.
I have made about a dozen waffles with this Waffle maker so far.
Just a light that comes on when the Waffle maker reaches the temp to add the batter.
How do you know when they are ready?  Just make a few, and you get the timing down.
Your consistency of the batter won't be exactly the same every time, so, neither will the time it takes to cook a waffle.
A note to beginners, Buy a waffle mix that uses an egg and milk, instead of an Instant with water.
The results will be fluffier, and crisper waffles.
Also add a very small amount of Vanilla to the batter, for a delicious background taste.
(Very little goes a long way.)  The batter should NOT be runny, but rather somewhat on the thick side.
Pre-spray the Teflon non-stick plates before heating one time each session.
YES, dry Teflon plates will eventually make stuff stick to it.
When the Ready Heat light comes on, Ladle enough batter to evenly 3/4 fill the bottom grid.
If you fill the bottom grid all the way, stuff will ooze out the sides as it cooks and expands.
Give the maker at least 3-4 minutes before being tempted to open, because premature opening will destroy the waffle before it firms up.
Most folks just wipe them out with a paper towel.
If you must wash the unit, don't completely submerge it in water.
This is a well built device, that will make lots of waffles.
But, if you have a large family, make them in advance and store them in a warm oven, or Freeze,.
The REAL Whipped Creme in an Aerosol Can, is the tastiest.
Boy, are YOU in for a tasty treat.
I have had this for several months and use it frequently.
It is easy to clean and makes a nice, deep waffle.
It feels sturdy and I expect to have it for a while.
Bought this as a replacement for a model my wife picked up at a local retailer.
had company over the week it arrived and it is simple to use and the waffles were GREAT !! EASY to clean, also.
We've been married 10 years and gone through a lot of waffle irons.
We bought two of these because we have a family of 6 and it's great for making lots of waffles.
I leave mine in for ~5 minutes as the manual states or maybe ~3 minutes after steam emerges.
I've tried Bittman's easy waffles and a buttermilk waffle recipe with great success.
I've been using my new waffle maker for a couple of months now and am very pleased with it.
It heats quickly, cooks evenly, is truly nonstick and cleans up easily.
I love the large deep pockets of Belgian waffles and am very happy with this purchase.
Very good product - makes waffles crispy outside and tender inside.
Takes only 8 minutes to make them just right for us.
I've only had this thing for about 2 weeks, but I've used it three times.Things I like about this waffle iron:1.
Using their recipe (doubled) and leaving the waffles in for a little over half the recommended time, I made delightful waffles.
Substituting half whole wheat, fewer eggs, and a little less oil, I made pretty good waffles.2.
As long as you don't stint on spraying the thing with cooking spray, the waffles pop out easily with no sticking.3.
Once I accidentally unplugged the microwave after using this thing (instead of unplugging it like I meant to) and I didn't notice for 2 hours.
Meanwhile, it didn't short out or burn up or start a fire.Things I don't like about this waffle iron:1.
I use a wet paper towel and get most of the cooking spray off, but it is almost impossible to get it all.
Luckily I don't care all that much, but if you are a neat freak it could drive you nuts.2.
Cooking spray drips through the cracks in the hinge and ends up on the counter.3.
And of course the first one is cold by the time the second one comes out.
Purchased this gift for my sister because I already have one and have used mine for quite a few years and nearly every week.
It would be nice to have one that makes more than one waffle at a time but you pay so much more for those.
And these waffles are good-sized waffles and you can break them into 4 sections to start serving among your hungry family as they cook up.
It does have an indicator light to tell you when it's ready for the batter.
The non stick surface is easy to clean and the waffles turn out perfect, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
I actually use this much more than I thought I would...the kids love them!.
I had one just like it for over 20 years and it finally gave out.
This one was a Belgian waffle maker, something I didn't realize until It arrived, but it makes great waffles and does so quickly.
After a few months the thermostat/ready light stopped working correctly.
Hinge is made well and does not keep old food.
It is easy to clean (for a waffle maker).
Never add batter to a cold waffle iron.
Then people complain it sticks.I use Pam right before i pour the batter.
People say you should not, but it works for me regardless.The cooking time for a well done waffle is 4 minutes.
Buy two if you want to cook for families.
This machine has worked really well with the Golden Malted waffle mix we bought.
My single complaint is that I wish the plates came out so you could wash them, or better yet put them in the dishwasher.
The instructions say to wipe with a damp cloth.
I don't know how you're supposed to do this with the deep holes in a Belgian waffle maker.
This waffle maker is very easy to use and comes with some basic recipes and ideas for toppings.
I have never made waffles of any kind before and this iron made it them perfectly.
I love chocolate chip waffles, so the only logical thing to do was get a waffle maker!This thing has been great.
It cooks evenly and quickly, doesn't stick, and I like that it has sections.
It cleans easily, too, which makes it easier on me or my husband when we're cleaning up.
I've never had any problems with this waffle maker, and I would recommend it to anyone that loves waffles!.
I read a LOT of reviews before picking the 26500.
I gave serious consideration to the Villaware UNO Classic Round Waffler, but decided on this instead.
It's my variation (sourdough) on the fabulous Belgian Goodnight waffle recipe you can find online.
I make a mix of dry ingredients ahead of time.
I have a small digital scale in my kitchen, so bear with me.
Let it sit at room temperature for a day or so and you have a starter.
the waffle never sticks as long as you include the oil in the recipe) and pour 5.5 oz (i.e.
half) of the waffle batter into the iron (or, make 1/2 recipe, which is what I do these days).
When done, repeat with the rest of the batter.
Replenish the sourdough starter with 3.5 oz flour and 4 oz water.
It took me 15 minutes to pick the pieces from the grids.
Thus, he counsels, you would have to use two separate circuits.
That's over 80 waffles (usually one each morning, sometimes two).
I've noticed the last few weeks that the waffles come out considerably darker from the front (opening end) of the waffle iron.
If that trend continues, it may be not usable.
Don't know why it would do this or what I could do to alleviate it other than to petition a warranty replacement.
Meantime, I'm eating a waffle (or two) for breakfast daily (using the sourdough recipe above in this review).Edit (7.16.2013): Still going strong.
I've probably averaged 3 waffles/week for the last year.
I am still using the mix, just add water and extra flour instead of sourdough starter, include baking soda in the mix.
Lately I like to sprinkle some sunflower seeds on the lower plate before pouring in my batter.
The I spatula out the rest of the batter into the waffle iron and sprinkle some sesame seeds on top before closing the iron.
I generally set a count down timer to 6 minutes and just wait for the beep that says "breakfast is served!".
Wait about 5 to 8 minutes depending on how think you poured.
Perfect!!Be sure to spray lightly with Pam for best results.
Don't immerse of course! Since I use mine every weekend I just wipe it down and store with a paper towel inbetween.
(Every now and then will use a little soap to clean.)Very satisfied for the price.
If it beeped at you when done I would have given this product 5 stars :).
It cleans up easy and will store up right to take up less room in the cabinet.
I look forward to many delicious waffles in the future.
I have had this a year or two now.
It takes at least 4 minutes to cook a typical waffle and be sure to plug it in before you start mixing the batter.
It takes several minutes to get hot enough to start cooking.
Once hot though, you can bake one waffle right after another.
When I make waffles with sweet potato, or other heavy batter ingredient, it takes about 6 minutes to cook one.
It is easy to tell when they are done as the steam really slows down that comes out around the edges.
For the price I am sure it cannot be beat.
I use a paper towel when it is just cool enough to not burn me when I run the paper towel between the bumps.
The first instruction was to wash the grids with soapy water.
Rinsing the soap out was time consuming but I got it done.
I oiled it using olive oil on a soft brush.
The first waffle was baked for about 5 1/2 min, removed easily and was browned nicely on both sides.
I topped them off with blueberries and nonfat, plain yogurt.
DELICOUSI am going to buy another for my mom and would definately recommend to anyone.
Really impressed by the speed and ease of this product -- heats up in no time plus no fussy dials/switches.
And, after a few practices, you'll discover what amount of minutes you will need to make your perfect waffle.
Instructions say (I believe, going by memory) 5-8 minutes, not for me.
It may take a few waffles to get exactly what you like.
My old waffle maker of 17 years only took 2 minutes, this one, was more like 3 or 4.
Great waffle maker, if you like waffles, you'll love it!.
Add milk, butter and vanilla; mix well.Stir into dry ingredients just until combined.Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; fold into batter.
Bake in a preheated waffle iron according to manufacturer's directions until golden brown.Serve with strawberries or syrup.Yield: 10 waffles (about 4-1/2 inches).
I've used this items on several Sunday mornings!  It works really well.
I purchased this product for my daughter who loves Belgian Waffles but did not have enough counter space for a bigger machine.
I bought this about a year and a half ago for my stepdad.
Just the other day at breakfast, he told me how much he loves it!.
I plan to experiment with using a spatula or something else that will open this efficiently and safely.
But I shouldn't have to go through such a hassle over such a simple step.
Made waffles for grand daughters and they loved em.
Open box item was so reasonable and it works perfectly.
Slightly lift the top lid and if it sticks that means they are not done yet.
Bought this for my son and daughter-in-law several months ago and they still enjoy it.
So, not a bad gift for the price!.
Got this based on reviews and I'm glad I did.
It's easy to clean, makes great waffles and compact enough to store easily.
It arrived in time and though we have only had it a month we are very satisfied!.
Gave as a gift and the recipient has been very pleased.
Says it makes perfect crisp waffles and cleans up easily.
It makes plate size waffles and each time it's perfect.
It heats up fine and i use the CISCO butter spray before i pour the batter.
People say the lid gets to hot but I personally have no had ANY issues opening and closing the thing.
just wait until it cools down and wipe with a clean damp cloth.
i don't do many reviews but i'm hoping this review will help with your choice.
I've owned this for a bit over three years and it still works perfectly.
Easy to clean, uniform heat creates great waffles every time.
Indicator light tells you when to quit and small footprint means it doesn't take valuable space in the kitchen.
Very pleased by the performance and durability of the product!.
We got it a year ago and use it about once a month and it has worked well.
Maybe not as good as a cast iron version, but that is a hell of a lot more expensive than this.
This is a food value for money and makes good waffles.
used it several times to cook waffle, using the mix bought from grocery store.
Replaced one of those waffle irons that you rotate - like the ones in motels.
This one works perfectly and is simple to use.
It is a bit small but not too small.
It seems to have been made somewhat cheaply but it works ok and is not junk.
Sometimes there are some very small areas that do not get cooked totally.
We are thinking of buying another one for when there is more than just the two of us for breakfast.
Cleans fairly easy.It would get 5 stars if the plates were removable.
Clean up was very simple with a wet, soapy towel.
It works great, makes excellent waffles; cleaning is fairly easy (I have no basis for comparison here).
I bought this waffle baker because of the reviews and because of the price.
So many out there just cost way to much and you have no idea how good they are.
I have used it alot since I got it and it does work wonderful.
I lightly grease it before pouring the batter with butter then follow instructions for how long to cook.
In the recipe book I used the weekend waffle and they are awesome.
And it doesn't cost you and arm and a leg to have.
It stores easy and works great, and it was a great price.
We haven't really had it long enough to say how durable it is but based on other reviews I think its probably fine.
I use to buy store bought waffles until there was a recall on my favorite waffle.
I love the compact design as it makes storage easy.
that is my only complaint about this gadget.
I bought it for my 10 year old for Christmas because he LOVES Belgian waffles.
Little did I know it would be a great appliance that makes wonderful waffles and now our whole family loves them.
Waiting 4 minutes for yours to get done seems like a lifetime.
The appliance is fast, easy to use, easy to store and makes a great waffle.
My mom had one as I was growing up so I purchased an identical one and love it.
So simple and easy to use would suggest this waffle iron anyone and everyone.
It does take some time to make each waffler.
About 5 minutes, something to keep in mind.
We bought two of these so we could prepare the waffles for breakfast a little faster.
Great decision!  The waffles are well browned, light and airy and the baker recovers heat quickly so the next batch can get going right away.
At the price they are impossible to beat.
I am a BIG KitchenAid fan and I was goign to buy the Pro model that lets you bake two at once.
I could buy five of these at the price of the KitchenAid.Thinking of buying a third so we can all eat at the same time.
Really love this waffle maker! The only thing I wish was that you could take the plates out to clean them.
This gets lots of wear and tear from my 14 yr.
of mix figured out, it's mess free, too.
Clean up is so quick and easy that a 14 yr.
It also can make crispy or soft waffles.
I recently purchased this waffle maker and have found it to be very easy to use.
The only drawback is that the handle gets hot so I make sure to open it with some protection.
I make lots of waffles and freeze them for later use.
I don't find the time inconvenient at all and I really believe this is as good as the fancy models at other places.
Works great so I can make perfect waffles!.
The next day, we heated the frozen crispy waffles in the waffle maker and it tasted the same.
We also made waffles that were just cooked for 5 minutes and it was fluffy.
The half closer to the opening is cooked more than the half near the hinge.2.
The bottom is cooked more than the top.
I love waffles and this contraption makes great waffles.
Its easy to use and slim to keep put away.
Makes what I consider to be huge waffles.
If I were to order another, I would not choose Belgian Waffles as they are so large.
I keep it in the original box when not using.
So this isnt the best waffle maker in the world.
but its so simple and easy to use and easy to clean!.
Buying a second, possibly a third and just run a production line.
Make enough at one time to last awhile.
This waffle maker was purchased to replace a bigger, more expensive model & brand.
It costs much less than the "other" model and is by far the better appliance to own & use.
There's even a well surrounding the waffle iron griddle to catch any over-spillage so the unit remains clean even when over-filled.
Just goes to show that more expensive isn't ALWAYS better!.
This waffle iron has been working wonderfully for months.
It has a great space saving ability too in that it is able to be put away standing up on its side/base.
Cooks waffles consistently and the waffles never get stuck.
I purchased this for my husband who loves to make homemade waffles.
My husband stills likes the 'old' iron but really - this new waffle iron is a great improvement.
I loved this waffle maker because it has a wonderful and simple design.
It does not have complicated grooves to clean or dials to set.
Simply plug it in and wait for the running light to go off.
Simple to use, simple to clean, and very compact (simple storage).
I've never made a bad one with this waffle baker.
I recommend it to everyone who wants good waffles.
The cord is a little on the short side at 24&#34;.
The none stick works great and mostly no clean up.
Does the job good as it should and not too big to store when not in use.
I bought this as a gift for a fun family breakfast on the weekends.
This works well and does the job, but there is some guess work as to when your waffle is done.
The pan makes just the right size pancake for little ones and others who are watching the calories.
The pan was easy to use and pancakes came out great.
Keep the burner temp lower than usual and you will have perfect pancakes.
I loved it, and it was a gift for my daughter  she like it and makes tasting waffles excellent , we love it.
Not perfect even cooking but close enough to make breakfast fun with the kids.
Proctor Silex makes good quality appliances at a reasonable price.
It heats quickly and cooks evenly; it also stores in a small space.
I would recommend it to anyone who wants to be able to make waffles at home.
Very easy to operate - a light clicks off when the waffles are done cooking so there's no risk of burning them.
Is there anything as decadent as Belgian waffles when you're camping?  (In a trailer, of course).
I didn't find the handle so hot I needed a pot holder.
It wiped out easily since nothing stuck to it.
The cord is too short -- barely long enough to stretch from the counter to the plug directly above, below the upper cabinets.
Since the taut cord got in the way of the open lid, I had to put a box under the waffle maker.
I had this on my wish list based on its reviews and I got it for my birthday.
I've only used it a couple of times.
The first time I used it I sprayed it with cooking spray.
I had a hard time chiseling off the waffle pieces once it was fully cooked.
After that, I had no problems with sticking.
I did notice that my waffles didn't cook evenly.
I found 4 minutes of cooking time worked well for us.Things I liked:--Waffles were deep.
You cannot make a bad waffle on this thing!  The other reviews are absolutely spot on, and you'll find similar reviews on other websites.
We've actually made brownies on this too, they turned out great (modified from original brownie receipe, not like cooking in the oven).
The title of my review almost says it all, it bakes evenly, doesn't stick, and it easy to clean.
I have had mine for quite awhile and it is still like new.
I will keep this short and simple.This waffles maker makes great, evenly cooked waffles, over and over again, without fail.
I bought this as a gift for a friend because he really wanted a waffle maker.
Ever notice how the first few pancakes always suck? I don't blame the product.
I think it just happens!! So far, so great!.
Cord is not super long but not too short for normal counter top use.
Even in a tiny kitchen it's a keeper.
(I recently purged 40% of my possessions, and this one stayed.)Now I can enjoy my delicious whole-grain waffles regularly and on short notice.
Serve with diced fruit or frozen berries with 2 teaspoons of honey or maple syrup and small pats of butter.This recipe makes 7 half-cup waffles.
DON'T use spray oil like Pam because it will gunk up the works, and the waffles slide out easily without it once cooked.
Anyways, it will pay for itself in a few breakfasts.Thanks for reading.
Used it for the first time over the weekend.
I am going to try to use it with a wheatless batter.
I will post my results if they turn out!.
After several uses it still looks like new with no cleaning necessary.
The easy to see light indicates when to fill and when it goes out it's done, simple! Makes perfect Belgian waffles.
Did I mention it's so easy to clean? I don't know why you would want to pay more when this one works so great!.
Makes excellent waffles, easy to clean, compact size, good quality.
I would definitely recommend this one over the ones available at places like Walmart, etc.
Waffles are nice and thick, crispy on the outside and tender in the middle, and looked good enough for a restaurant presentation.
I like to make waffles on occasions and am not a pro at it by any means.
My first batch came out perfectly the way I liked it.
All of my other batches have been good.
Every waffle recipe will work in this waffle maker.
Every time I buy a kitchen appliance, I wonder, "Will it work without wheat?"  This does so, beautifully.
I made cornstarch waffles with it last Saturday, using a modification of a cornstarch waffle recipe that is on the Argo cornstarch website.
(The recipe is on the food blog in my profile.)  This is a very nice waffle iron, and it works well without wheat.
I like fairly firm waffles, but not crispy.
Its a cheaper waffle maker, so maybe its "you get what you pay for".
Super easy to use, a breeze to clean.
Just remember to use a cooking spray before each waffle.
Makes awesome waffles, about 7 minutes to cook.
Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughters boyfriend.
He could be yanking my chain and just telling me that to be a suck up.
He's been using it, and learning how to make good waffles!  Solid product, good hinges and releases the waffle easily!.
It's a waffle maker and it makes waffles.
It doesn't have any fancy features, but it doesn't need them.
It makes waffles and it does a good job of it.
Simple to clean up, doesn't have a particularly large footprint when stored.
For years we would go to the neighborhood IHOP and order their Belgian waffles, which are like seven dollars for one.
Yikes! But they were just so good that we splurged.
So I came to my favorite online store, Amazon.com, and perused the various models and read all the reviews.
The Proctor-Silex 26500 Morning Baker Belgian Waffle Baker blew all the others out of the water as far as the reviews were concerned.
I ordered the waffle maker from Amazon and within a couple of days it arrived while I was out of town on work.
When you are done, you close the lid down and then it sits on it's end, taking up very little counter or shelf space.
Thank you PS! It comes with a recipe book of different types of waffles you can make.
We kept making waffles until we found the perfect time and they have been perfect ever since.
We just use the timer on the microwave oven which sits just over the counter.
So you will have to experiment with timing your waffles too.
With their return policy, you have nothing to lose!.
I love to have a waffle with strawberries and whipped cream.
So I had to get one of these for home and it does make a nice perfectly toasted waffle just like the picture.
but for my husband and myself..this unit is absolutely perfect!!  5 STARS!!!!!!.
This one produces a huge waffle, enough to fill one person.
The only downside may be not knowing the amount to put in the maker.
Most of the times I think I have put the right amount, but while cooking it over flows on the sides making a mess.
I foresee many more waffle days in our future lol.
It's not particularly hi-tech, but it does the job.
Also, it's thin, which makes it easy to store when you aren't using it.
I like that this is small, easy to use.
Not so easy to clean, but that's a waffle maker for you!  Very compact and stores away easily.
We bought this waffle maker recently and it functions very well.
It seems that the correct cooking time for a waffle is 30-90 sec after this light goes off.
It makes delicious waffles that come off in one try leaving no residue behind on the plates.
I've used many waffle makers in the past where the batter sticks to the plates and requires you to clean the plates between each waffle.
This is not a problem at all with this waffle maker.
I cooked 5-6 waffles in a row without needing to spray or clean in between and each one turned out perfect.
I purchased this product for my boyfriend's birthday.
We are in the process of experimenting with different brands of waffle batters as some brands taste better than others.
No matter the taste - this product cooks them all to perfection.
The large Belgian waffle wells make it easy to hold a variety of syrups and toppings.
We plan to have Sunday morning waffles on a regular basis as a result of this purchase.
Very fun to make waffles with the family on the weekend.
Wife makes very awesome custom waffles for everyone and there's no flaws with the product.
No such problems! My first waffle was gorgeous and delicious :) I used the Chelsea waffle recipe from Isa Chandra Moskowitz's Vegan Brunch cookbook.
There was no sticking, no burning, and virtually no cleanup.
I like that this waffle maker can stand on end for easy storage.
12/03/2011: One exception added to the cleaning /  WHITE develops a severe scorching yellow to the OUTSIDE edges of top cover.
[5 Waffles about 5 min each]Bluberry Muffin - Mix as package directions state.
I have the George Forman Gill which also comes with waffle plates but I wasn't impressed.
I debated if I should get a waffle maker given we already had one but given the great price, I thought what the heck.
I debated between this and Presto flip version but I don't regret my decision.
I've been wanting a waffle pan for a while now, but don't have a lot of room for storage.
We've had this waffle maker for 1.5 years.
I'm not really a waffle person but my husband is and he absolutely loves it.
We always spray it with a bit of oil before putting the batter in, and use almost a cup of batter per waffle.
I have used this around 100 times and it is fantastic.
It's easy to use and easy to clean.
You can't go wrong with this waffle maker.
My daughter recently married and did not receive a waffle iron during her showers.
That meant she was always borrowing mine, so I decided to purchase her one of her own.
The only problem with this waffle iron is that it make much better waffles than mine! :) Getting myself one.
Other than my own mistake, I have no complaints.
I've made waffles about 7 times since I got this 2 weeks ago.
everyone loves the belgian waffles&#8230;how easy how light how delicious and how economical!  awesome tool for kitchen and yummy recipes made easily.
Allows for making healthy alternatives to what is found in the freezer at the grocers.
Does require a bit of guess work, but still not difficult.
You just have to watch for the escaping steam to subside to ensure the waffles are done.
You cannot just watch the lights go off, but this is clearly stated in the instructions.
Also I must compliment Amazon in keeping their promise on easy open and recylce friendly packaging.
There is one design flaw in this unit - no breathing room between the griddle and the front handles to lift the top.
Personally, I find the deeper grooves, and slightly larger circumference a plus to the overall quality of the waffle.
Note: baking time was slightly longer as well, at about 4 minutes instead of 3 per waffle.
Spending money on a &#34;flip&#34; waffle iron would be a waste, unless you own a restaurant.
It's small, stores easily, and has wowed many a guest for my hosted brunches.
This is &#34;Keep It Simple, Stupid&#34; at it's finest.
I receiged a gift card from my co-workers for my birthday and I decided to look for a waffle maker.
I sorted the appiance via customer reviews and this one caught my eye.
With so many good reviews I felt I couldn't go wrong.
I made me my first waffle this morning, using the recipe on the Krusteaz box.
Wow was it ever good!  As I had sprayed the inside with grapeseed oil it came out whole.
I thank all that left such glowing reviews, which made it easier for me to choose this particular waffle maker.
We've made the waffles in the booklet it comes with but our favorite is to buy the pumpkin mix pancake mix at Trader Joes.
I bought this very one for my daughter when she was in college 15 years ago, and she's still using it.
She uses it all the time so decided I'd get one for myself and I love it.
And this one does exactly what I need without all the bells and whistles.
The machine is easy to use and works well.
Easy to use and releases waffles no mess easy when you spray it with pam.
Infact, its a must that you use a non stick spray.
no harder to clean than any other waffle maker Ive used either.
It makes good waffles easily and is easy enough to clean.
How many bells and whistles do you need to make a waffle?  And the price was right!!.
This is an awesome waffle iron at a great price.
This iron makes thicker waffles than I was used to with my mother's 30 year old waffle iron.
This shows the waffle maker is heated and ready for the batter.
They also tasted great - moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.
My daughter had hers with Nutella, I had mine with peanut butter, and hubby had his with raspberries and maple syrup.
Yum! Cleaning after baking is easy too - just wait for the waffle maker to cool down and wipe clean with a paper towel.
If you know how these sandwich grills work then you'll definitely love it.
If you never had one then you may be disappointed a little.
I loved mine and the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because after few months of use the plastic handle broke off.
O well you can't get much for price like this.
I brought this for my daughter for the holidays last year.
From what she tells me, it a snap making hot sandwiches.
My favorite meal is a plain, simple, grilled cheese sandwich, and I'm tired of cooking them in a frying pan - including the flip.
They do not fit a normal size piece of bread and especially don't fit my favorite round loaf sour-dough French bread.
Even though I like several grills that I've owned for meats, they just don't work for my sandwiches.
I like my sandwich with a browned, toasty, surface, and the Meal Maker delivered.
That lifted right out with a spatula with nothing left behind.For what I got it for, it is a very reasonable solution.
No need to turn for over easy and chancing breaking the yoke.
I like to put a little cheese on top while frying and it does a great job.
Also like to grill tomatoes in the other side when doing eggs so I can make my whole breakfast at once.
We have had one of these sandwich makers for over a year.
We like it and have had no problems with it.
It is great for grilled cheese as it does a great job melting the cheese.
It's easy for my husband to use and always a surprise for our four year old to see what is in his "pocket" sandwich.
Great investment and easy to clean as long as you don't over-fill the sandwich.
We've made almost every combination you can think of including dessert pockets.
Our four year old gives it four stars!.
By dinner time, all I want to do is crawl over to the couch and take a nice long nap.
And my kids have LOVED pretty much everything I've made in it.
Cheap and reliable way to not scald the milk for your cappuccino.
I'm a fan of instant thermometers, I use them for cooking and frothing milk.
This one is easy to read and works well.
This thermometer is easy to read, even if it gets a little froth on it.
It has been accurate in temperature and helps keep foam at the same consistency.
I use my thermometer for not only cappuccino but other things as well (like making sure my water temp is correct for yeast).
It is small and nicely attaches to cup or whatever.
Before purchasing this, I would just guess as to when the milk was hot enough.
This thermometer works for the use that it was intended.
A little overpriced but hard to find so I'm just glad I was able to find it any price.
I bought this item and enjoyed it for a while, is well made and quality materials, as described on amazon.
As you might expect, it does in fact tell you the temperature of your milk.
it's for a frothing pitcher.)  The yellow shading on the "sweet spot" of the dial is clear and useful.
Perfectly adequate tool for the recreational latte maker.
Thermometer works as designed and helps to keep the frothing consistent from one day to the next.
Do you NEED this? That is debatable, but I am happy that the coffee gets made the same way each day.
Clips to frothing pitcher in just the right position making it easy to read.
One can control the temperature of the milk quite accurately.
this is great and it does exactly what I bought it for -- it froths the milk prefect.
This is not the best looking thermometer, but it sure as heck works.
I had previously been using a meat thermometer and a binder clip when steaming milk for cappuccino.
This purpose-built thermometer is much easier to use.
The large numbers are easy to read and the target temperature zone is highlighted on the dial.
The metal clip is detachable and will work with other thermometers if this one fails.
The thermometer clips conveniently to the frothing pitcher and reacts almost instantly to the temperature of the milk.
It's not easy to know just where and at what angle to clip it so you'll be able to see the dial while you're frothing.
This thing is nothing fancy but it gets the job done.
Perfect temp every time I froth, great item and doesn't break the bank since I'm just learning to make lattes and other drinks.
Stick the thing in the frig and it will work forever.
The dial is easy to read and the thermometer doesn't take up much space in the frig.
I've read Fast Food Nation and I own a fridge thermometer.
I told her that I was using a PROFESSIONAL thermomet i.e.
They are sending "factory service" out to me tomorrow.
There's no way that the methods used are the same as Sears to avoid fixing uncold fridges.
A suction cup model may be a better choice.
Clear, readable "safe zones" for both fridge and freezer use.
The temperature reading won't be quite accurate if you place it up front near the fridge/freezer door (this is true with any thermometer).
Every time you open the fridge it lets in warmth and affects the thermometer reading.
It's best to place this towards the back instead.
This temp gauge is easy to see and use.
I bought it to use in the freezer and refrigerator.
It is not designed to show temps outside of the refrigerator's normal range.
I purchased this and a few days later purchased the MIU 90062 thermometer, one for each fridge.
They gave the same temp readings when placed next to one another so I assume they are pretty accurate.
The advantage to the Taylor is the giant dial which makes it easier to read.
The advantage to the MIU is it costs less and the dial is easy enough to read, but with smaller numbers.
We've been using this thermometer for 6 years now, rotating it between the freezer and the refrigerator.
The big, bold numbers make this thermometer extremely easy to read, even at a distance.
I use it in my refrigerator and have found it to be 100% accurate.
I like this one the best of all the refrigerator thermometers I've tried.
This shows a temperature range and it's easy to read.
I have one in refrigerator and one in the freezer compartment now that new compressor has been installed.
Then I may not have had to find a repairman on a weekend.
There isn't much to really say negative about this thermometer.
I wouldn't think we'd need an oven thermometer.
Isn't the oven setting correct? Well, at times it isn't.
My wife is an artist and needs an oven to dry certain types of paints.
Both the timing and the temperature must be correct.
Next we tested our kitchen oven and it was low by about 20 degrees F.
Many ovens are way off and we can easily make the small adjustment.
In any case, our Taylor Thermometer worked well and provided an inexpensive check.Gary Peterson.
The large display is very easy to read compared to smaller thermometers.
It quicly comes up to temperature and the large dial makes use easy.
great product, the reading area is soooo big, and I like the fact it indicates you what temp is perfect for each protein.
My old one quit working so I had to replace it.
I like using it when I bake a ham or turkey.
I am happy with this tool for the price I paid.
Everybody should own one if only to check the turkey temperature at Thanksgiving.
It's compact enough to fit in the drawer, but big enough to use when it's called on.
The 'screen' is large and the reading is fast.
I like it much better than the smaller types.
This meat thermometer is fantastic and I am thrilled with it every time I use it.
Thank you Amazon for carrying this wonderful product!.
There are no Celsius markings.If you want extreme precision there is way to calibrate the thermometer.
Mine seems to be off by by less than a degree f and is very repeatable.
It gets there but it will test your patience slightly if you're accustomed to a fast responding digital.
Works fine and gives a reading within 10 degrees f at boiling point.
All that is ok once you have tested it you can allow for that drop in temp.I amm quite happy with it.
Mine came with the little red marker broken off.
It works fine, but I need to put my reading glasses on whenever I check the temps.
If the marker were more sturdy, that wouldn't be necessary.
Totally unneeded for those with young eyes - and it's a fairly large scale, just can't see it well myself.
I've had a Taylor meat thermometer for over 20 years and decided to replace it with this larger dial, newer style.
The first one they sent stopped working properly after about 6 months and the red indicator arrow kept falling off.
Maybe there is a difference depending if the chicken is organic or not (mine are organic).
Perhaps the simple solution is to roast chicken til it reaches 190 degrees, like the old thermometer used to say.
Haven't tried roast beef yet, but am curious how the medium-rare dial setting will turn out.
The dial is very large which I like so it can be read easily.
The housing seem to be made of good quality materials.
I like the fact that I don't have to look up cooking time because it's on the face of the dial.
Bought one of these a year or so ago and use it often inside the BBQ and the oven.
Showed stains from use and when it somehow got bent, I bought two more.
I used this while cooking a corned beef brisket in a pot.
It takes a few seconds for it to get an acurate read but it works well.
The construction is sturdy and its easy to read.
I was able to shake it out but it was not easy.
I would recommend washing this thermometer carefully and not running direct water over the display or submerging it.
Very accurate and seems to do what my wife needed.Shows temp very quickly which helps being able to close the oven door with minimum time.
This will help people that have poor eye site because it is pretty large.
I have used this for both indoor and outdoor cooking with chicken, beef, and pork.
The dial is easy enough to read and it didn't fog up in the grill or the oven.
It's been reliable and accurate in all instances.
That's about all I'm looking for in a meat thermometer, so for the price it can't be beat.
This thermometer is so easy to read and very easy to use.
I am a first time user so am not an expert.
I like that I can use it in the meat while in the oven.
The needle on this is a little springy so I know it's not stuck or dragging.
Easy to read and sharp enough to easily go into a standing rib roast.
I don't expect it to last forever, but I'll be buying another one of these when that time comes.
This meat dial thermometer works like a charm.
It does exactly what I need it to do and is easy to clean!.
It takes accurate temperature and works just fine.
This is the best digital thermometer I've ever used.
First, it comes with its own case to prevent damage.
Second, its stainless steel and seems to be fine after a time in the dishwasher.
The LED screen is easy to read and has an on/off button to conserve battery use.
**UPDATE, 1-2012*** I still am very happy with this thermometer.
I have bought several more for my relatives and they are happy with it.
I just stress to not manhandle it and be careful as it is not waterproof.After reading the reviews I purchased this item.
Since I am careful about keeping instant read thermometers out of the water I wasn't concerned with buying a waterproof model.
The only thing I can nitpick about it is that it is top heavy when you clip it to your clothing.
I hooked it in an apron pocket and it kept falling over.
The thermometer works well and accurate out of the box.
As another reviewer stated, insert the probe in the target area before turning it on for quickest reading.
I have been using this one for several years.
If you are looking for a cheap accurate thermometer that will not cause you to wince when lost, this one is a good choice.
One of the ongoing questions about these thermometers seems to be just how "instant" an instant-read thermometer is.
It's going to take at least a few seconds.
Watch the time until it hits 32 F (freezing temperature for pure water:  salt water can hit 0 F).
At sea level, pure water boils at 212 F, but as you get higher than sea level, the boiling temperature drops.
That will tell you how quickly it adjusts and how accurate it is.
This model replaced the older analog instant read thermometer.
The accuracy has been good and it has an easy to read display.
When sticking in, it takes about 5-10 seconds to come up to temp.
So if you are in front of a hot oven it can seem like forever,  But it does what I need it to do.
This is the second Taylor thermometer that I have purchased.
It is accurate and very useful for cooking meats.
During the summer I grill and need to have something to let me know the internal temperature of the meats, especially chicken and pork tenderloin.
I would recommend this product however and the price is certainly right.
I have used one for years and wouldn't be without it.
Bought this one as a gift for a friend, and he is now a believer!.
I bought this thermometer a couple years ago and use it very often.
I think it's worth it to pay significantly less for the con of having to wait a few seconds for it to read top temperature.
I'm actually writing about a thermometer????  I like this little gadget.
The instant read isn't really &quot;instant&quot;  it takes some getting used to to know when the actual temperature is right.
The first battery I put in was defective and the scale went all over the place, replaced the battery and it worked fine.
I did notice that the little switch appears to be fragile, but I haven't had any problems yet.
I just don't know how often this will get used, given my &quot;cook till it looks right&quot; philosophy.
Makes me feel professional to have it though.
This is a great thermometer; it works well, is easy to use, and is easy to read.
Just don't put it into the oven like I did - it was ruined!  But I bought another one.
I bought this for my boyfriend who is a Chef at a high scale resort.
The temps have to be perfect at this vacation spot.
He uses it daily and its sleek enough to fit in his chef jacket.
This item works well and is exactly what you would expect out of a meat thermometer.
Instant turn on, accurate readings and sturdy, combined with a good price make this a winner.
Bought this for my dad after he saw mine.
It fits in my apron pocket and is my trusty sidekick at the grill.
This worked great right out of the package and comes with an extra battery.
I switch it off, and then place upright in a cup in the cabinet so that does not happen.
These things are great and if you don't have one spend the $10 and get one.
If you cook, BBQ, or anything like that, get one.
Who actually keeps the packaging?  If it weren't for that it would have five stars because it works great.
Works like it is suppose to and I really like having the cover so that I can prevent future damage from happening.
AS most of the time the order was filled properly and packaged well.
I definitely recommend this thermometer over any fancy digital one for home use.
Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have any issues.
My wife cooks for a living and she needed this thermometer in order to see if the temperature is right.
I bought this to replace an old similar unit that failed after 10 years of use.
This product works as advertised and is relatively inexpensive.
Have had it for a little while now and have not run into any problems.
I did have to replace the original one I bought.
The snap-joint which allows you to access the battery compartment was weak.
And I dropped it once, and it came apart and broke a wire.Taylor did replace it for the cost of shipping.
Easy to use and so easy to read.
Much nicer for me than the dial ones.
Reccommend it to anyone who cooks alot and needs the ease of digital.
A decent thermometer is essential to the process.
I own several, everything from ancient bimetal strip thermometers to a "lay on the couch and watch a movie while smoking meat" wireless thermometer.
I also own one of these Taylors, and have for several years.
I've never had to change the battery and its been used in our house for everything from meat temperature readings to bread yeast preparation.
It is quite accurate, only low by two tenths of a degree F on boiling water for my altitude.
Faster than a mercury or mechanical thermometer, but not instantaneous.
I bought one of these about 4 years ago to develop negatives (film) in my bathroom.
I probably developed 40 - 50 rolls of film using it to test the temp of the various fluids and its worked without a hitch.
Great for cooking, now I only burn half the things I put in the oven.
I keep at least 5 on hand at all times...I Burn them/drop them..sometime they fall in the trash can :/.
This thermometer has a clear display and easy to press buttons.
Having the case is nice so you dont reach into your drawer and get poked.
I bought this thermometer to replace an analog thermometer.
Overall it works well, just turn it on and test the meat.
I did have an issue where the thermometer got a bit too hot on the grill and got stuck on 888.88.
I had to shut it off a couple times and let it cool down.
I wish the probe was a bit smaller, but besides that this is perfect for anyone who wants to grill perfect steaks.
This is a good meat thermometer for the price.i haveo ne and vought another for a gift.
Seems to work well, I've had, ine two years.
I use to measure water temp for my Japanese teas.
very sensitive instrument - and yes, it is instant.
I got laughed at, but how else am I suppose to know when the oil is at 350 degrees?.
I do wish the length of the stem was a bit longer for when I'm working with things that are deep.
Impress your BBQing friends by bringing it with you to cook on their grill.
My bread has been perfect ever since receiving this thermometer.
This thermometer works fine, but I wouldn't call it instant.
It can take up to 30 seconds to get a reading on a hot food like meat.
I have another &quot;instant read&quot; thermometer that came highly recommended a few years ago.
I knew there had to be something better.This baby really *is* instant.
I don't have to worry about it melting over the grill, because it won't be there that long.
It's almost fast enough that it seems a waste to take my hand away.The drawback, however, is the on-off switch.
It's far too small, and more than once it put a dent in the top of my fingernail.Overall I'm very happy with this thermometer.
this is our second one, the last one died- because we dropped it out side! our fault.
this is so handy, I never put it away.
I use it to check meats so I can stop cooking before I turn dinner into jerky.
it works on liquids and I even use it to check the temp on the hot tub to see if its running right.
easy to use, reads the temp quickly and will keep updating if you leave it in.
if you forget to turn it off, you will know how warm your house is.
for the price, you should get one just for the convenience of it.
it tops out at 300 so dont use it for candy that goes past 300 (to hard crack stage).
I bought these for our restaurant when our old ones broke.
These work great, arrived quickly, and were affordable.
They have held up very well considering they are abused daily at our business.
Needs to have string attachment point but works perfectly.
I'm pretty sure my other one was "borrowed" by a relative who also liked it.
Actually, she did me a favor --- this newer version allows you to use the case as a handle.
I admit that I am a terrible cook and I need all the help I can get.
This Taylor thermometer is one thing I can rely on to help keep me from serving undercooked meats.
For $4-5 this is very efficient and functional equipment.
It's "instant read" because the dial is constantly adjusting to the temperature based on the metal inside the stem.
Now it works very accurately, you can always test it by setting it in ice water or boiling water.
I've only had it for a few days so I will update if anything happens.
My family has been using this thermometer at least once a week for the last two years, and it is still very accurate.
It shows the same temperature as friends' digital thermometers when they've both been placed in the same piece of meat or water.
Tayler is the standard in kitchen thermometers and this one is not exception.
Works really well, especially on the roasts I like to cook.
it is much smaller than i expected, i probably didnt read the specs well enough.
so far accurate and did noot break when i dropped it on the tile floor like the digital i had before.
This Thermometer works great, it does it's job well.
I use it for bread baking and have had no problems.
The first served me well for several years, until I mistakenly left it stuck in a roast and closed the oven door.
Don't try this at home.Pretty quick readings, very easy to keep at hand and store due to small size.
Inexpensive and convenient, I would be lost without it.
This will fit in a shirt pocket, and is accurate and fast reading.
The case has a built in "wrench" that allows you to re-calibrate it if it starts to drift.
The price on Amazon is about half what it is in retail stores.
Great for steaming milk and checking bread baking.
Plastic dial - not safe to leave in the oven.
came with the handy plastic holder (as shown on the picture) and now drinking tea is a delight.
You can also use it for food of course.
very good, although i am not really using it to test food, but it works well just as a room thermometer.
I bought it knowing that it was an analog thermometer.
It works, seems to be quite accurate, but is very very slow.
If I could do it again, I'd buy the instant digital model.
Provides your temp readout quickly, and comes with a pocket clip that the probe slides into, or can be used to calibrate the thermometer.
My last thermometer got tossed because it couldn't be re-calibrated so that was a feature this one had to have.
"Taylor Analog Instant-Read Dial Thermometer" (Taylor model # 5989).This is a great "instant read" thermometer.
I've had it for years and it works quickly and seems accurate enough when I've done comparisons with other thermometers (nothing scientific about my process).
This thermometer took 8 seconds to tell me my water was 160 degrees.
I also use it for meat temp checking when roasting, etc.
I haven't timed those, but I don't feel like it takes very long.
So, to me this is pretty darn "instant".
If you are like me and need reading glasses, you will need them to read this dial.
:)  On the other hand, I think that the small dial is why the temp can be registered so quickly.
To solve the small dial reading problem, I tried the "Taylor Anti-Microbial Instant Read Thermometer with Extra Large Dial" (Taylor model # 8018).
That is a terrible thermometer (see my review for it), don't bother with it.
Not quite as quick as I hoped but does the job it`s intended to to do with ease having the case in nice.
I love this thing for measuring temps in my water, germinating tray, you name it.
I originally paid $2.49 for this on Amazon  and the price increased over time to $6.61.
Nonetheless this is a good value and eligible for Amazon's buy 3 get one free promotion for kitchen items.
My local grocery store is asking $9.99 for the same thermometer.
The one inch diameter dial is small and is thus a bit hard to read but this also makes the thermometer compact.
The dial is plastic so remember that this is not an oven thermometer; it will melt in the oven.
I bought this to make yogurt where I need to keep the temperature at 112 F.
It responds quickly enough for yogurt making while heating and cooling milk.
It reads very quickly and the dial is just big enough for me to read clearly when I wear eyeglasses.
I've used it twice and it worked both times.
It's a handy size, has a plastic case for the stem, for carrying in a pocket.
It looks the same to me as professional cooks carry for their constant testing of food temperatures.
works like a charm right out of the package, easy to re-calibrate with the on-board tool (on the sheath)works great.
This is a very small thermometer and came with a nice cover for it.
It works pretty well...it is smaller than what I'm used to, but overall it's very nice!.
Nice little thermometer and it comes with its own little bright yellow case (not shown in the product photo) which is quite handy.
For the money, you would have a hard time finding a better deal.
For people who use a cooking thermometer only occasionally like we do, I would highly recommend this one.
And qualified for Amazon Free SuperSaver Shipping as well (delivered five days after we ordere it).
If you're looking for an instant meat thermomenter to tell you when your meats are finished cooking-look no further than this one.
It's made well enough that it gives you a quality read each and every time you use it.
It's not a newfangled designer kitchen gadget but it gets the job done and every cook should have one.
Only negative was the high shipping cost more than item.
Item came quick, but then I saw the same thermometer for $6 at Stop and Shop.
Use the ice and cold water to calibrate to 32 degrees and you are ready to go!.
I have to use this to gauge water temperture otherwise my yeast won't bloom and then my bread dough will be useless.
I like the strong plastic protector for the sharp pin.
Don't rely on the picture to guess how big it is though.
But it does the job at a cheap price.
Never had one of these and now I wish I had one earlier.
Works good and seems accurate and easy to store.
It works, is easy to read and easy to clean.
I bought this few years back, Amazon does not list the purchase date, but anyway it is still as good as new.
I use it occasionally for meat, it works, but takes a few minutes to read the temperature.
Not a big deal for me, but will be annoying for frequent users.
I like the simple things and this does exactly what it should.
I use it for all my cooking and baking needs and would be lost without it.
I ordered 3 of these for general purpose use in the kitchen and around the house.
The sleeve comes with a built-in calibration wrench which makes calibration simple and easy.
Just make an ice/water slurry and stick the thermometer in.
Once the needle settles, calibrate it to the 32 degree mark.
It seems to be very accurate however and can be adjusted if the test is somehow off.
It is cheap and does what it is supposed to do.
I would recommend it to others.So yea anyway.
I have never used one of these ....it worked well.
Considering this was so inexpensive, go for it.
I got this thermometer to test the water temperature in our house, but it can also be used in meats and other things.
It starts at 0 degrees, which most thermometers do not do.
Just what we were looking for and couldn't find in a store.
I was able to buy two of these thermometer for four dollars and some change each.
That's much cheaper than any of the box stores (that I've seen).I calibrated them and from the box they were spot on.
Surprise surprise - it worked and was quick!!!  :) So easy and simple...don't waste your money on the more expensive ones!!! Sometimes simple is best;).
The only complaint I have is that the face sometimes fogs up, but if you figure out a solution to steam, I'm all ears.
I needed this thermometer for refrigerator temperatures- and it is very accurate.
The only issue with it was that it's so slender in it's sleeve that I lost it and had to buy another one!  LOL.
I haven't tried it yet.but it is a little smaller than my other one and has a casing to cover it.
The good thing about this thermometer is that it requires no batteries.
The layers expand and contract at a particular rate, causing the coil to move.
The battery instant thermometers have a "thermistor" or a device that works electronically to give a number that can be read out digitally.
WELL MADE AND WORKS FLAWLESSLY.EASY TO CLEAN AND NO BATTERIES TO MESS WITH.DIAL IS EASY TO READ AND UPDATES TEMP QUICKLY.
Easy to use, serves a good purpose, sturdy built, works fine.
Looks like it could last a very long long time.
This is just what I needed to track temperature when making my own yogurt and for roasting meats.
I never expected it to come with the carrying holding and pocket clip!  That was a pleasant surprise!.
Gotta have kitchen item that is very reasonably priced with fast shipping.
No, it's not an instant read but it only takes a couple of seconds, plus it is very well made and durable.
Everyone talks about how convenient, versatile and simple this little thing is.
The head is about the size of a quarter.- Speed: The needle moves a lot faster than the liquid in a candy thermometer.
Instant-read it's not, unless you mean that you can instantly read the temperature after the needle stops moving.
But it's still pretty fast, and as you see the needle slow down, you get a pretty good idea of where it's going to stop.
Kind of like knowing where you'll stop when you hit the brakes.
It's pretty accurate - accurate enough for most uses.- Coffee: I use it mostly for making French pressed coffee.
If you put boiling water in coffee grinds, you will likely get a bitter brew.
I pick the pot right before it reaches a boil and use this little device to read 205 degrees F.
Drop the water into a french press containing coarse grounds, and four minutes later you have excellent coffee.
Thanks to this little guy I discovered that eyeballing the water in the kettle is not a good way to figure out the right temperature.
I love how quickly it reads a temp.
However, the 'sensor' is a bit high up on the probe.
I had trouble temping a burger, because the meat wasn't thick enough :  (__!__) didn't work, but (__\__) did.
Works well nothing amazing but gets the job done I use it for chicken it can be useful at times.
Not a whole lot to say other than it works and reacts pretty quickly.
The pocket clip makes it easy to keep on hand with you as you move to stove or grill.
There may be fancier or more expensive thermometers out there, but this is a kitchen standby.
You can even utilize this to gauge milk-frothing temps or bread baking temps.
there are so many applications where a thermometer comes in handy.
Does what it's supposed to do, nothing more.
What more could I ask for when looking for something cheap and simple?.
Whenever I travel to see some of my tribal friends abroad, we always worry about not cooking the tourists thoroughly enough, and in today's environment.
well, you never know what kind of strange disease could be lurking in them looky-loos from around the world.
Be sure that you and your cannibal friends cook them to the right temperature clear through before having your Hannibal picnic feast.Seriously though.
High quality and I've tested mine for accuracy and it's dead on at freezing and boiling.
The pocket holster is great for keeping it handy without having to rest it on the counter top.
where did I sit those fava beans and my Chianti?.
I got this primarily because getting out my electronic one is an ordeal for small things like pan frying or something.
The holder is really nice and the temp.
I use this to test the internal temperature of my bread and it works great.
When I first tested it in some ice water, it came out 32 degrees.
Even though the thermometer is fast, I wish I had spent a little more and got the instant read.
Taylor 5989N Classic Instant Read Pocket Thermometer What can I say, it's a thermometer, it works and does it's job.
I purchased this thermometer for a recipe, English Muffin Toasting Bread, by King Arthur Flour.
They also offered an instant reading thermometer for $24.99.
This thermometer was a real bargain!I have had many thermometers over my cooking years, and like socks, they seem to disappear.
Where do they go? Presumably they break easily, and were thrown out.
I did not want to pay a lot of money for a thermometer I would use every once in a while.
I mixed the combination well before I took the temperature.
I went on to combine the rest of the ingredients, and let the dough rise.
This is one of the fastest and most delicious breads I have made.
If you want to make this bread, go to KingArthurFlour.com , go to recipes, type in English Muffin Toasting Bread.
Can not keep it inserted in meat while cooking.
At first I didn't realize I needed to calibrate this thing.
I used a pot of boiling water and put the thermometer in the middle of the pot to calibrate it.
Does a good job and easy to read.
Didn't want or need a really expensive one with batteries to worry about.
A must have for any one that cooks.
Take the guess work out of when food is done.
I have one in the kitchen and another with my grill stuff.
I just wish I knew if it was made in the USA or not.
Either way its great and versatile for many uses in the kitchen.
I mostly use it for measuring the temp of my milk when I make yogurt.
this thermometer should not be left in the oven.
It works pretty quickly and is very easy to use.
Got this because my old one wore out and it worked very well!  I needed it for Thanksgiving and it arrived in time!.
Although smaller than it appears on line, this little thermometer is amazing at how quickly it reads the temperature.
Just by holding the probe in your hand, it will give your body temperature.
I even sterilized the probe and put it under my tongue and it read 98.6 degrees body temperature in seconds.
Amazing and the smallness of it is just fine for all sorts of meats.
I liked the actual temps instead of the &#34;rare&#34; Medium rare&#34; etc.
great for the money,highly recommend for all cooks to use,,chef grade quality..easy to use and clean--storage is exteremely easy Excellent.
I have had no problems with this thermometer.
I hand wash mine and its holding up fine.
Love this easy to read dial and the cover!.
When I first got these I checked for calibration.
One was a little off adjusted with the wrench included have been right on ever since.Good reasonable priced thermometer that is able to be calibrated.
I've always had a meat thermometer, but they are so bulky that they sometimes get caught in the drawer when you open and close it.
I was looking for something that would lie safely in the bottom of the drawer, and this is it.
This is a great tool for roasting in the oven, especially for poultry or pork.
I plan to use it for grilling as well, as soon as the weather cooperates enough to let me cook outdoors!.
I bought this to replace a broken thermometer - one with a glass column that was very slow to give a temperature readings.
It gives readings quickly, and they seem accurate.
Smaller than I thought which is good because that means it will be easier to store.
I am very happy with the quality and accuracy as well.
I am using it to monitor my Worm Bin temperatures.
I am not really sure how accurate it is.
OK, it is just a thermometer, it won't cure world hunger and is not a panecea.
There is no way to guess or push your finger in a piece of meat to determine if it is done.
This is a nice thermometer, I have used it for a couple of food items.
It has a nice little sleeve to keep it in too.
Very good especially in relation to the price I paid.
Takes up very little kitchen drawer space and works relatively quickly, but definitely not instant.
I used it for Thanksgiving turkey and turkey burgers.
It is a pocket thermometer and it does read the temperature that you need to check pretty quick.
It's one way of making sure your central unit or car a/c is working properly.
I boil tested it when received and it tested correctly.
Good thermometer but he face is a little small.
Works good but kinda hard to read in low light without a flashlight.
Last month I stepped on my old Taylor thermometer I was glad to find this one at a great price.
The product was delivered on time.I have decided to buy a couple more to have on hand.
I have recommend the thermometer to many friends.
This thermometer works great for setting my small wine refrigerator to the right temperature.
Wine does taste better if it is not refrigerated too cold.
When it is out of use, I keep it on my desk as a indoor thermometer.
I had one of these that we kept in the kitchen and it is a quality product, and registers quickly.
I think everyone should buy one - they are so inexpensive and usefull it just makes sense to have a few of them.
Solid construction...but just don't put it in the oven with the food or you will melt the cover.
I calibrated it when I got it and it was almost spot on.
This is a necessity for checking meat temperatures and I love this.
I used to employ my digital timer with the long cable and probe for everything.
This one is a real treat! Zip out of the drawer and you know the temp.
This is a very nice Pocket Thermometer for the price.
nice!!!! i bought two and gave one to my daughter.
I checked this in an ice/water mixture and in boiling water, and it's right on at both temperatures, so I have confidence in the readings.
When it's not in any liquid or substance (such as food), it displays the room's temperature, so I trust it with food.
It's relatively fast at displaying the food's temperature.
I would suggest not putting it in any pocket without the included sleeve.
I have used my pocket thermometer several times and I am very pleased with it.
I expected a thermometer that went to -40F.
I specifically bought this one because of that, since I'm going to be monitoring a freezer temp that might be below the normal -20F.
The one I received only goes to -30F.
Anyway, my freezer isn't even below 0F, so I'm not going to return it.
Accuracy is not critical (+/- 2 F) as I'm interested in making sure our new freezer is operating in the proper temperature range.
Allows a quick check every time I remove an item from the freezer.
I was looking for a fridge/freezer thermometer that made it easy to tell when the temperature was in the correct range.
This is it!  A quick glance and you can tell if your refrigerator or freezer temperature is correct or out of whack.
Inexpensive insurance for all the food in your refrigerator.
This lets you chill things that don't spoil and move things that spoil easier to colder areas within the fridge.
We had been having a problem with leftovers not keeping in the garage and we think this might have been why.
I am obsessed with the temp of my fridge.
This was a cheap solution to my problem.
They look and do what they are supposed to.
We were wanting to monitor the temperature in our freezer but unable to find locally what we were looking for.
This is perfect and doing a great job.
I have 2 refrigerator/freezers and one standup freezer.
I rotate one between the two freezers in the garage.
They all measure almost identically, so I feel they are good quality.
I had no problem hanging this from the wire shelf in my freezer.
Easy to read and seems to be accurate.
Easy to read.The mount uses suction cups that hold okay, but I don't think the cups will last the long haul.
I bought a Taylor meat thermometer years ago when I first got married.
Back then, the little stick part that goes into the meat was made of glass.
After 30 years of use, it finally broke.
I looked around locally for a replacement, but couldn't find one.
I found this new thermometer at Amazon and it's better than the old one (if that's possible).
The little stick part that goes into the meat is now made of metal (stainless steel?) It's really strong.
I'm sure I'll have this one for another 30 years.
This is just the type of thermometer I have been looking for.
I used to have one many years ago, before computers and Amazon.com, but it broke or was lost.
I couldn't find the same kind for years, until it showed up on Amazon.com!  This thermometer is old-fashioned, but accurate.
I purchased this thermometer specifically for my sourdough bread baking needs.
It is has a nice classic design and is easy to use and read.
As one of the other reviews stated, I am concerned about the print on the faceplate fading after continued usage.
I trust the protection of the glass tube, but.
I wish the casing wasn't so high up the thermometer.
This is probably just a "me" thing, but I like to see the progress of the rising temp gauge.
This one has stood the test of time.
Lightweight so it works for smaller cuts too.
If you bake breads or cakes, you do not want to be without this thermometer.
The numbers are easy to read and the thermometer is small enough to store in any drawer or cabinet.
i dont do a lot of bread making but i am an avid meat smoker and griller.
the taylor classic roast-yeast thermometer has taken the stress out of preparing a feast for my guests.
i have tried more expensive thermometers but some read out an obvious wrong temperature and others are very difficult to read.
Was skeptical this could work for that, but it works great.
the problem with metal meat thermometers is that they eventually get gunk stuck inside the glass and the needle sticks.
the thermometer gives a read in 3 seconds or less, and is easy to clean.
the markings are easy to read and i did not find that the numbers scratched off at all.
however, i would not put this thermometer in the dishwasher.
Thermometer is very easy to use, read and clean.
I can not roast a turkey without it.
I like the fact that this thermometer can be read from nearly any angle.
I replaced one I had that was over 35 years old.
It can stay in the meat while it cooks, and it is accurate.
Glass thermometers have less issues with calibration than any other type of thermometers.
The problem with glass is that they are typically fragile and slow.
Taylor does an excellent job encasing the thermometer in stainless steel, which means it is greatly protected against breaking.
Also, as I already stated, this thermometer rapidly provides a measurement.
So I will be happy not to have to guess on my meats temperature.
As we expect from this brand, so far this themometer is a good buy.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I still prefer this thermometer over everything else out there for cooking meat in the oven and proofing yeast.
I cracked my prior Taylor after using it for 20 years.
I love that the new version has bigger numbers - easier to read!.
Does the job, seems to be accurate, good tool for dough making with yeast when temperature is very important.
The calibration seems a little off, but I just compensate for it when I read it.
This is a great thermometer that I actually use almost daily.
Grilling, oven roasting and of course bread making.
This is simple and just what one needs for a bread machine.
I got this to use on meats too because of the temp quite line on it.
It's just a tad big to be sticking in meat.
I have used it and it is accurate so that's a plus.
I still like the smaller ones specifically for meat.
It is also great when cooking a roast.
Got an extra for a friend who also loves hers.
i use it for all my roasting oven needs.it does a great job and the temperature is accurate.thanks for offering it.
These work, I use in roasts, as a guide so soon as it shows the min temp, take out an like sit 15-25 min.
I wanted to try rapid rise yeast, but it requires hotter than usual water.
This little gizmo is working perfectly to help me with those recipes.
I don't know why I've never bothered to purchase this thermometer before but it was reccommended highly to me so I bought it.
I have not had a dud bread since I started to use this.
Well worth the price, none better and easy to re!.
Only thing is over time the markings for temp tend to fade, but this is only after many years of use.
I don't fry food often but on occasion I make southern fried chicken for football games and plantain chips (they go great with homemade guacamole).
I attach this thermometer to the side of my cast iron dutch oven and get cooking! It is reliable; water boils at 212F or 100C.
Others have complained about it being off 6-8 degrees which hasn't been my experience at all.
The gauge is easy to read and the writing/numbers have held up well.
Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.
I have always used the glass candy thermometers and they ended up breaking because of one reason or another.
I saw this one and decided to try it.
It is so easy to use and clean.
I am so happy with it that I have order one for my boyfriend who also cooks.
I purchased this to make fudge for the first time ever this year and you can't really do that properly without a thermometer.
I gave this item 4 stars because of the clip.
It does not "clip" to the pan as stated in the product description.
Before I took it out of the package, I thought the clip was stationery and it just clipped onto the pan.
The thermometer I got has an adjustable clip, which slides up and down and rests, not clips, onto the side of the pan.
Unlike other reviewers, mine actually measured above 220 degrees and they probably didn't let their syrup boil long enough.
Some of the other reviewers also stated that the thermometer was hard to clean or that the markings wore off or the glass cracked.
If you're only going to make fudge, brittle, or other types of candy once or twice a year, pick one of these up.
It registers fairly quickly and has a wide range.
I've had this thermometer for quite a while and it has stayed accurate.Best store it upright and in a place where it won't get jostled.
Works great for heavy duty candy making for the wife on holidays especially.
I like the way that it can clip to my deep pan that I use to French Fry foods.
Great thermometer-accurate, easy to read, what more could you want?Well, the printing of the numbers could be more durable.
I clean mine in the dishwasher, with the numbers facing away from the direct spray.
So far, so good.Mine lasted about 10 years until I broke the bulb.
Despite the less than ideal printing, I am buying another.
I like this product very much but did not realize it was going to be so large.
Despite having to hold it, I find it does a great job.
I've tried other thermometers when I deep fry food, and none work as well as this one.
I don't know why you'd use anything else.
I bought this to use with a deep fryer I bought specifically for cooking chicken wings.
Knowing my oil is at the proper temperature has moved my wings up to the level of perfection.
I have had several candy thermometers in the past and all have been less than ideal in use, the Taylor solved all those issues.
I especially love the foot designed to keep it off the bottom of the pan.
This is a good thermometer!  It gets the job done.
Nothing overly fancy about it, but then again, what else would you really need?  Recommended.
Have had this one forever and it's still the only one I use when I make candy.
With the holidaus approaching, this oldie, but goodie, is a must-have for your kitchen gadget collection.
Seems to work as advertised but a lot bigger than I thought it would be.
Overall pretty good, only knocked it down one star due to the size.
This model clips on to the edge of the pot and is easy to read.
Finally I came to my senses and tested them all at once, clipped around the edge of a pot of boiling water.
But now that I know, the rest are relegated to the garbage.
And to have the Taylor name made it even better!  I love it!.
I had been making fudge and doing the water method to determine if it was in the soft stage and let me tell you.
When it reaches 240 degrees which it is also mark 'soft stage', I know it's time to remove from the heat.
It has all kinds of markings on it next to the degree markings.
I like the idea that it has an adjustable clamp on it to fit any depth size pan.
The glass tip of the thermometer is about 1/2" higher than the metal framing to prevent the tip from touching the bottom of the pan.
You can see why some people have had these for years and years.
I also needed one that responded quickly to temperature changes and this one does just that.
The cost was reasonable, while others seemed way overpriced.
My mother had one just like this so I bought my own.
Was weary because of other reviews, however, they must have been using a jackhammer to clean it.
Dont have the need for use for everyday but used once already and worked great.
I don't make candy but can see how you would need this thermometer for that too.
This thermometer is well made and is a necessity for deep frying.
I have a 15K BTU burner on my stove and even with that i'm surprised how much the oil temperature drops when food is added.
This helps to maintain a temperature suitable for deep fat frying (350 to 375 degrees F).
Any hotter, the oil smokes and any cooler the food absorbs oil and gets mushy.
The clip on the back of the thermometer adjusts nicely to almost any size pot.
I have never had a candy thermometer before so can't compare it to others, but I used to make M.
Stewarts blueberry preserves and it worked just great.
Product arrived on time and was wrapped well.
I like it has clip on the back to click to the pot/pan.
However, I do wish temperature reading scale is separate in 5 degree rather 10 degree.
I have always had trouble keeping my candy thermometers working, they usually break when I need them most.
In the past I used the round glass candy thermometer.
I have made lots of candy with this thermometer and had absolutely NO PROBLEMS at all.
And best of all the price is right!.
This looks like the classic candy thermometers from when I was a kid.
It does the job and is easy to read.
Especially awkward to use around boiling hot candy lava.
Works Great!  I bought this for my daughter when she was in Culinary School.
Great for those going to culinary school or just to use at home.
This thermometer is perfectly designed, with the bulb sitting far enough away from the bottom to give a proper reading.
It is a bit difficult to clean unless done so immeadiately after use.
I did end up breaking one after scrubbing too hard to get in the crevice, but went right out and bought another one.
When I want to fry chicken or donuts I can rely on a good thermometer that would tell the right temperature to hold the oil.
This is a great tool to have in the kitchen.
I&#8217;ve only used this unit a few times but it worked well and seems to be well made.
I'd buy it again if i needed another.
Perhaps you could get some other product that does a little better, but at what price.
I find something like this that I don't use that often to be perfect for what I need it for.
When it says that can be cleaned in the Dishwasher, it's True.
Thanksgiving cooking proved to be the usual oven spatters, but even the thermometer came shiny clean in the Dishwasher!!.
This works well - so far as I know - lol.
It has been really helpful in realizing how long I need to preheat my oven, since the oven would register 350 long before this did.
Now I know to wait at least 30 minutes, just like most bakers recommend.
This is a true mercury thermometer and the reading is 100% accurate.
The only negative - the numbers may be hard to read for some people.
I highly recommend this for accurate oven temperature.
I guess I didn't read the dimensions, but this is larger than I was expecting it to be - which is a positive.
After having several dial-type oven thermometers, I went back to this style and really like it.
I was never sure if the others were accurate.
After reading many reviews, I bought this one locally.
Here's how to get the most out of it.First, put it it a pot of boiling water.
Use a pair of tongs to read the temperature while the glass is fully submersed.
In a minute or so, it will be cool enough to handle.
Carefully slide the glass thermometer the direction necessary to get the correct reading.
Mine read about 205, so I slid the glass toward the bulb.
Give the oven and thermometer time to adjust to each other, up to half an hour.
My thermometer read exactly 300 degrees at that point.
Repeat at 400 degrees, mine read exactly 400.
If your thermometer reads  another value, you know how much your oven is off.
Some ovens are adjustable at their knobs, but electronic ovens are not.
I have already scribed (scratched) the key lines and numbers into the metal.
I used a straight edge and sharp scribe point tool.
Minus one for requiring adjustment on day one.
I will deduct another star if my numbers wash off.
I wasn't sure if my over dial was actually giving me the temperature I was setting it for.
Sometimes my baking recipe's would not come out as expected.
Using this thermometer I was able to verify that my over was in fact putting out the temp that I had set the dial for.
tested it every 50 degrees and found it to be within a few degrees of exact.
Our first one sat in the oven for probably 5 years until it was so spattered and stained we couldn't read it anymore.
These things are very durable, simple, and much more reliable than your oven's internal thermometer.
If you live in an apartment, where the oven and its past treatment are unknown, this is absolutely required if you want to bake anything.
I keep two different brands of thermometer in my oven.The one highly recommended by Cook's Illustrated it the Taylor Oven Guide Thermometer.
I also keep a few extra to give as small tokens to my wonderful friends.
This nice guage is very easy to read as well.
Both read within two degrees of each other and the oven itself was right on the money!.
I was able to use this themometer andcheck my oven temperature.
It worked good and now I know my over is right.
These (alcohol) are supposed to be more accurate than the dial appearing (bimetallic) thermometers in every reference I have read.
Problem is, you get one tiny bubble trapped in the alcohol and it's ruined.
It's not the thermometer's/manufacturer's fault - just be very gentle with it, don't shake it/throw it around.
My mother had not been able to find one of these in the stores.
The only problem is that I have three termometers that give you three different results.
I tend to believe this one, as it comes out near the average of the three.
But it is a guessing game with my oven because it is running way under where it should.
Age have an effect? My toaster oven has the same problem though and it's newer than the stove.
But your guess about the accuracy is as good as mine.
We take it out as it gets in the way when we're baking.
Not much to say other than it shows the temp and just hangs in the oven.
Don't scrub too hard or the printing becomes hard to see.
This is the best sponge caddy I've ever had.
Suction cups stay in place!  The cups are large and pliable but also engineered exceptionally well.
The caddy sits far enough from the sink wall to allow air to flow and is tilted nicely to control the dripping.
Everything about it is superb if you're looking for somewhere to put your dish sponge.
I have used it from last many few months now.
I read other people complaining about suction issues, but as long as your sing wall is clean before you attach it you'll have no problems.
This works as a dish washing tool holder for me.
I like to keep it hand and to have able to dry out.
I have a double stainless steel sink and I used to put the sponge on the center area between the two sinks.
It looked tacky and my sponge never dried out between uses.
It sticks like glue and looks good too - would highly recommend this product and the seller.
I have one in the shower to hold bar soap and another in the kitchen to hold a sponge.
Gor bar soap it is great to keep the bar dry between uses so that it lasts longer.
It also doesn't get mushy between uses, which to me is the biggest drawback to bar soap.
For the kitchen sponge it does the same thing - it allows it to dry out completely between uses.
That makes the sponge last longer and not break down as quickly as if it were wet all the time.
The metal is slightly bendable so it can be widened if need be for a larger soap bar.
What more could you ask for?  Can't wait to get another one for my kitchen soon.
Not much to say about a sponge holder.
It's well made, heavy and has large suction cups.
I'm curious to see if it will rust at all, time will tell.
It stays up in my cast iron sink.
Great item for kitchen sink to keep sponge dry and fresh in between uses.
I've been using this one for a few weeks and have had no problems.
NOW it has a home and we point that out to them.
Well designed product for getting the sponge and drain plug off the counter.
Suction cups let go every once in a while, but easily put back in place.
ordered this item to use rubber cup holders for radar detector.
Had difficulty removing rubber holders from the sinkworks.
Once removed they easily attached to my radar deector, which had weak rubber suction cups.
I replaced my weak rubber cups pursuant to recommendation fr another reviewer to solve problem  with windshield radar detector holding to auto wind shield.
This was an excellent suggesion, sinkworks sucion cups are high quality, easy to remove, but hold to glass with tanacity.
Price is ok, and shipping fr amazon.com is always excellent.
I have owned this for over a year now and it does what is is supposed to.
Some reviewers have complained about the suction cups.
I'd probably look for something cheaper if I saw it at the current price.
Sunlight and oxygen kill germs, and prevent your sponge from staying moist when it needs to dry out.
Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to put back in place.
We don't use it to hold a bar of soap, so I can't comment if it is able to hold that much weight.
We just keep to scrubber sponges in it and they're relatively light-weight.
We've had it stuck on our sink for quite some time now and it hasn't fallen off once.
Great quality with excellent suction, helps me organize my sink utensils.
Put onto my stainless sink for my dish wand (1) and my sponge (2).
I bought this and wasn't sure how it would work but since I put it up it has yet to fall.
it works great and it has not rust.
i was worrying that it might rust in the sink.
I bought this as a way of keeping my sponge from getting moldy and smelly.
Sponges still get smelly, but not as quickly.
I also purchased the 4 sided version of the sponge holder, made by the same manufacturer.
It holds the sponge better, without letting in fall out the sides.
Also, the suction cups don't seem to work as well on this one as the 4 sided one.
It sticks to the side of the sink and occasionally needs to be &#34;restuck&#34; but that's not a problem for me.
Best of all it holds the sponge out of the sink so it can dry instead of breed nasties!.
The design is attractive and unobtrusive in my sink, and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
It does exactly what I expected it to.
These are a nice way to store sponges when they aren't in use so they dry out.
Using this and microwaving the sponges keeps them clean and useful for longer than just setting them on the edge of the sink.
We bought this to get the wet sponges, etc.
I bought this to use in the shower for a sponge.
It's perfect for that, and looks like it will stay put pretty well.
This stainless holder is lighter, so it stays put.
It stays cleaner because there is less surface area to catch food and dirt.
It is large enough to hold two standard size sponges or scrubbers.
Worth the price and happy with the purchase.
One for the kitchen and one for the bathroom.
They are so helpful to keep both places organized and providing more counter space.
The suction cups are strong and hold this in place on the side of my sink just as I wanted.
It makes for a nice, convenient location to keep my dishwashing brush.
I usually hate the soap holders that have suction cups, but this guy has stayed in the same place since I put him up.
It's a step up from a plastic sponge holder that I used previously.
This one looks much nicer on my stainless sink, and does not accumulate water and gunk like the plastic one did.
Super useful, never realized that I would need this item so much till I got it.
Now my kitchen sponge dries quickly and is separated from the dirty dishes stacked in the sink, which makes so much more hygienic.
Making your life so much better with not that much money, worth it!.
I've had zero problems with it sticking to the wall, which was my biggest fear, so that's fantastic.
On the other hand, there was already slight rust damage when I got it.
It's barely discernible, though, and so far the rest of it seems to be holding up well.
I have very little shelf space in my shower so this perfectly suits my needs!.
This sponge holder clings to the side of my sink and holds a sponge.
I've been using it for a long time and it has not rusted.
Small polishing marks on SS sinks will prevent just about any suction cup from sticking for any length of time.
You need to seal these imperfections; any viscous, non-evaporating (and non-toxic) liquid is what you need.
I use dish soap...well...because it's always next to the sink and less messy than oil.
Mine will stay up indefinitely using this method.
Fits nicely against the front of our sink and holds our sponge/scrubber.
Glad to get it off the &#34;margins&#34; around the sink.
I use sponges but I hate when they start to smell like mold.
A lot of these don't stick or aren't worth it and you end up throwing it away.
Luckily that's not the case for this one.
Suction cups stay put on my stainless sink.
This little gadget sticks well to my sink, which is made from solid surface material that is continued from our counter.
It holds a sponge and a scrubbie and is very handy.
SInce it's so open, the sponge and scrubbie dry quickly.
holds firm and books very nice for the money, allowing my sponge to dry like a charm.
Great shipping.The product's suction caps do not stay in place.
I have to wash, dry very well, re-attach.
Great size for a sponge, etc.All in all, it is a good product.
I have had this item for about a month and it stays on the sink just fine.
It holds a sponge and I put my latex gloves on top which I like to be able to do.
It holds all the little gadgets, like the SOS pad that always leaves a mess, my pot scraper and sponge.
It clings well to the sink and big enough to hold a sponge, small enough to not take up a bunch of space.
When I put it in the dishwasher the plastic one came out faded.
It also stays in place, even though I can't see a difference in the suction cups.
It adheres really well and holds both my sponge and the dobie pad.
Sponge holder arrived on time (free 2 day shipping w/ Prime.
Awesomeness).It sticks to our stainless steel sink fine.
Fits securely to the side of my sink.
The product looks great and is the perfect size.
I have a stainless steel sink and this looks good and the suction cups adhere well.
Her sink is a bit glossier than normal so it's not easy to stick the suctions cups on.
I've tried vasaline and oil as other people suggested to make it stick better and it seems to work.
It will fall off eventually though, you just have to put it back on.For my sink however, it works perfect.
My sink it porcelain instead of metal and the suction has never fallen off for 2 years.
It slides and moves but it won't fall off.It's enough for 1 sponge and 1 steel sponge or 2 sponges.
It doesn't take up sink space in my opinion and it's definitely a durable, long lasting product.
It is very nice, it stays put and has not rusted like my last one did, I am quite happy with the purchase!.
We have ours actually on the window above the sink for now.
Always hated a damp sponge sitting on the back of the sink and this solves the problem nicely.
The suction cups adhere well and the airflow lets the sponge dry out better to prevent that moldy, mildewy smell.
This is a solution for my problem of where to put the sponge.
It WILL STICK just put a little vaseline or anything with the same consistency on the suction cups.
Finally I got a good place to put my sponges.
It sticks very well and the space is very enough for three or five sponges.
I successfully mounted this item to a clean and non-porous surface in a secure fashion.
It is a little ''floppy'' once mounted but this is as good as can be expected of a Chinese made item.
keeps my sponge and small brush neatly neat.
I do not use this in my tub.
Rather, I placed it in my bathroom cabinet to store things like tubes of neosporin, Cortisone, etc.
If you have a small space this is great - it keeps sponges etc.
up and out of the way - yet handy when you need them.
looks nice on my tile backsplash, keeps my sponges and scrubbies air-dry.
doesn't work on laminate surfaces (they're too rough?), but that's not the fault of the design.
Perfect, the wide opening lets the water in sponge drip away, should not grow mold.
Had a plastic one and throwing it away, hard to clean.
I wanted a way to keep our sponge clean and let it dry.
Sometimes one of the suction cups slides off, but I've been able to fix it every time.
I am happy to have this stuck in my kitchen sink to hold my sponge and coiled stainless steel scrubber.
No more messy bowl on the side of the sink!.
I had one for my kitchen sink to hold sponges INSIDE the sink.
I wanted two, one for my surface sponge and one for my pots and pans sponge, to cut down on cross contamination.
The reason is because it was priced right and I think it's stainless steel.
It is small so I can fit two sponge holders in the sink side by side, no problem.
to be fair, only one of my suction cups from my original sponge holder lost its suction, one still works.
I bought this item along with matching sink strainer grids and they are awesome.
Theay are rugged and sturdy and look great.
I love that my sponge dries well in this little basket.
It holds my regular sponge and a scrub pad.
It sticks well to my Stainless Steel sink.
Got mine from Bed Bath & Beyond for about the same price -- plus tax/minus shipping.
After about 3 years, the suction cups finally stopped sticking to the sink but it's had a good run for the price.
It remains unrusted and otherwise in it's original state as the day I purchased it.
It allows the sponge to dry well without creating a place to accelerate bacteria growth.
This steel sponge holder is a great way to minimize germs and bacteria while storing efficiently in a location of your choosing.
It's durable, stylish, shiney/clean/new looking, and in my opinion, flawless.
I wish I could just buy the suction cups without the sponge holder since those are the only things that need replacing.
I purchased this a few months ago.Placed it on the inside of my stainless steel sink.
I wet the suction cups before I stuck it to the sink and it hasn't come off yet.
No rust problems either.It holds one large sponge easily which now drips into the sink instead of all over the counter.Can't beat the price.
Very pleased.UPDATE: After ten months it lost its suction.
Great while it lasted.I cleaned the suction cups with bleach, dried the sink, wet the cups and reattached.Voila! Good as new.
I'm one of those germophobes who hates finding the sponge sitting in the sink.
This product gets the sponge out of the sink and off the counter.
The suction cups are very strong so the product stays where you put it.
I bought this sponge holder to clear the clutter off my counter top and to help eliminate the moldy sponge smell.
It's the best looking sponge holder I've seen, sturdy and well made.
Unfortunately, my sponge still gets smelly, but not as quickly as without the holder.
This is exactly what I wanted, something inexpensive that will help me organize my kitchen sink.
Does just what I want, keeps my dish wand out of the way.
Suction basket works great! Great for keeping my sponge fresh and off the top of the sink.Why didn't I buy this sooner?.
Very nice and good quality but smaller than expected but quite functional.
Adds a nice and flair to the kitchen.
This sponge holder looks good in the sink.
It has not lost suction plus still looks new even though its been in use 5 months.
Much better then that plastic versions that show stains.
This gets the sponge off the counter top and is small enough not to take up much room in the sink!.
I have had this product about a year now.
I love that my sponge does not show when you look across my kitchen landscape.
The holder also allows the sponge to dry on all sides so bacteria growth is slowed on the sponge.
It also reduces the spread of bacteria to the sink/counter where it typically resides lying down flat.
It is rare to find such a handy and satisfying device for a modest amount of money.
I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting a really nice container to hold dish sponges.
As long as your sink is nice and smooth, this will stay put.
I've had several that fall off because the suction cups aren't too great, but this one doesn't budge.
We use this in our stainless steel kitchen sink.
It looks great and sticks great to the side of the sink.
It also helps keep our sponges longer as they can quickly dry.
I wanted a simple looking sponge holder (no one wants mildewy sponges) for my sink and this fits the bill.
It fits two sponges in it and it is un-intrusive in my stainless steel sink.
If you are having trouble making them stick, get them wet first and then stick.
I have even put it through the dishwasher a few times to clean it and the suction cups are still grippy.
There have been no signs of rust (even with the dishwasher).
This is a beautiful stainless steel sink holder.
It is sturdy and it is easy to keep clean.
the suction cups do not hold but I bought 3m hooks to use and they do the job.
Not a lot to ask.Second update:I've been using this for a year on my stainless steel sink.
About once every couple of weeks it slides down.
I wash the suction cups and the part of the sink where I want it to stick and it's good for another couple of weeks.
I removed them and found two small suction cups with steel hooks at the hardware store and hung the basket on the hooks.
Works fine and should be good for at least another year.
It would not hold 3, but very comfortably holds 2 standard size kitchen scrub/sponges.
If you got one of those super fat sponges it would probably only hold one.
But you can rely on it holding 2 of any standard size sponges or scrubbers.I'm very pleased.
This was an inexpensive purchase for something that has a lot of function and a nice form.
Use on the side of my stainless sink.
Also use in shower for bar of soap.
Sponges here sponges there sponges no longer everywhere!We have two sponge scrubbers tucked into this holder.
It keeps the dry and off the work surface.It works as it should.
I cleaned the tiles well and applied a thin layer of soapy water to the suction cups before pressing on.
After that I left it for a day before using it.
Now everything can drip dry into the sink.
I'd have bought it a lot sooner if I knew it existed.
I really like that fact that this is all stainless steel and drains so perfectly...keeps sponges, etc, very very clean.
This works great to keep your kitchen sponges fresh and mold free.
small enough to hold one sponge and a nail brush.
i put this in the smallest section of my kitchen sink and it fits there just fine.
Simple it works looks good and stays on.my stainless sink.
It is small and hold one small sponge who h is hood for me.
It's a substantial shiny stainless steel basket I ordered to use in the cabinet under my sink to hold my kitchen sponge.
This tucks it away, out of sight, nicely and keeps it fresh.
This is the first time that I've had a place to keep my sponge fresh and out of sight.
Suction cups hold it nicely to the sink and don't slide.
This is exactly what I was looking for.
Hard to say much more than you will get exactly what you want from this product.
looks great, sticks to the sink very well, what else is there to say about a simple but useful addition to the sink area?.
This was pretty much exactly what I expected and what I wanted.
The suction cups work great on my stainless steel sink and it has never fallen off since I put it up (~3 weeks ago).
There is room for 2 sponges which is nice.
Wish I had bought this years ago! Keeps the sponge out of the sink where it stays wet and gets stinky.
Now I drop the sponge in this basket and it air dries between uses.
Sticks to the sink well and was easy to put up.
It's small but works perfectly for my scrub pads.
After reading the reviews, I worried about the suction cups not staying affixed to my stainless steel sink.
I'm happy to report I have had no issues at all.
I simply wet them with a little water and they stuck perfectly.
Recommend!Update 4/13/12:  I've had this since February and the suction cups are still working perfectly.
It has yet to fall off since I placed it on the sink upon arrival.
Its perfect for a stainless steel sink, sturdy and fine for a sponge and drain stopper.
This will hold 3 maybe 4 bars stored vertically.
Somebody else mentioned that the back bottom part sags against the surface but for me, that's not an 'issue'.
Great for sponges to dry and not sit in the sink and get gross.
Nice to have a little basket for silverware on the other side!.
I use one side for my sponge, and the other to put my dirty silverware in.
I bought this for my mother, who lives in a manufactured home.
I have a 2 basin sink and the divider is a bit wider than most.
I love it, it keeps all my sponges dry.
It is a good holder and pretty sturdy too.
When I got a new sink, the metal basket that I used to have didn't fit over the lip.
I've tried several kinds with suction, which always fall off.
This one stays in place but is flexible so it doesn't really get in your way.
I have been using this for some time now.
It certainly fits most of what I wanted in a sink caddy.
All the others I looked at employed suction cups or rigid containers which might not fit the dimensions of my sink.
This product keeps the wet sponges and brushes draining into the sink rather than lying in the sink or on the counter.
I remove it when I have large containers that need to be washed in the sink.
It will adjust to any sink and because it is clear it isn't an eyesore.
One container is deeper than the other for such things as silverware and bottle brushes.
I just wish it had a better design to keep the containers attached to the strap.
Other than that, I am quite happy with this purchase.
I never cared for sponge holders that have suction cups.
This one from InterDeisgn is mold free and stays put.
I can throw it in the dishwasher for sterilizing.
Too bad it isn't prettier&#8230; at least the clear plastic design is subdued against my stainless steel double sink.
I am afraid this tends to get in the way of my smaller sink.
Still it does what it is supposed to do.
i had the standard one pocket holder on my dish rack but really like this one better.
i even put half a sponge in the side i use forutensils to keep my cat's utensils separate from mine.
i don't use it on the sink divide; it's too large and interferes with sink use.
It sits low so you don't have to stare at your sponges, etc.
I am an organizer junkie, so I have tried many different sponge holders.
If you're lucky enough to have a double sink, this design is my favorite by far.
The size of the holders is great for my two kitchen sponges.
might be a little small if you plan to use it for flatware.
It helps keep my sink area organized and the holder is easy to keep clean.
I use it for my sponge and brushes.
It keeps them off and away from my sink.
Very handy and isn't in the way of working in my sink.
Very happy I found it and purchased it.
It seems like it will last a long time.
to put my plastic scrubber and my steel wool scrubber.
Keeps them handy and out of the way.
I was always fumbling for a place to keep my scotchbrite, as well as placing silverware in the sink awaiting washing.
How pleased I am with this handy little caddy.
It looks nice on the sink, I put it in the dishwasher a couple times a week.
It holds several pieces of silverware on one side and a sponge and scotchbrite pad on the other.
Such a great little tool for the kitchen.
I needed something wall mounted and cheap to hold a roll of paper towels in our garage.
It was quick to install and does the job.
I didn't bother with making sure it was completely level when I installed it.
I'm not sure I'd put this in my kitchen, but its great for basements, garages.
Since we have limited space overall, and even more limited storage space, we are always looking for creative storage ideas.
We installed them (open end pointing up) on the inside of one of the doors of our bathroom vanity....and they work great.
Simple/minimalist - doesn't take up too much space, which is good.
Just slip out the old tube and slip on a new one.
The paper towel holder came earlier than expected.
It took minutes to install under my cabinet.
I had a little problem keeping the round cover on and it took a little longer to click into place.
It looks fine under the cabinet and does the job.
These are handy little things to have on hand.
We do not drink soda, however we DO drink tonic water (with vodka--LOL)! Love the idea of not wasting the remainder in the bottle.
I can't drink regular beer and I just have a small glass at a time.
and this keeps the remainder fresh and full headed in the bottle.
works with any carbonated bottled beverage you care to keep fizzy.
We drink from 1/4 to 3/4 of a two liter bottle on one of our volunteer workdays at Ives Road Fen.
I then install this and give it 100 pumps.
It keeps enough fizz for one more drinking by my wife and I.
Whatever is left after that is poured into the soil by one of our acid loving plants to lower the pH of the soil.
Only getting one more use of the Coke is probably the result of the physics of bubbles rather than any defect in the pump.
I decided I would search and see if they still were being sold.
I am happy and she is happy and now I am going to order more.
It is not just good for 2 liter bottles but also the 20 oz.Thanks Amazon for having them available.
A great product, it does what you want it to do, keep the fizz.
My mom used to have some of these so when I found them online, I ordered them.
Just be sure you pump it until the bottle is firm and doesn't squish in when you squeeze the bottle.
I wouldn't be without my fizz keepers!  They keep any fizzy liquid fresh just by tightening the top to the bottle.
I have had two fizz keepers for many years now that I have used and they have worked fabulously.
Can't tell you how pleased I am with them.
Works better on smaller bottles because you have to do alot of pumping to get the bottle where it is no longer pliable.
It has to be very hard to hold the contents in place so the fizz stays put.
It's like when you open a soft drink bottle and you hear it hiss.
I don't even remember buying this thing but I'm glad I have it.
It's just a little item that actually works.
I used to avoid 2 liters because we never drank them before they went flat.
Now I can order one with pizza and not feel like I'm completely wasting my money (even if they're over priced at pizza places).
It may seem silly to review something like this, but it feels good to find an item that does what it's supposed to do.
Otherwise it will explode like a rocket when you remove it from a bottle.
They have always seemed to last a couple of years which, for the price, is not bad.
It does take a few pumps on a near empty bottle, but they work just fine.
If you like that &#34;fizz&#34; these will do the job.
I, myself, have always preferred my carbonated soft drinks in the .5 liter or 20 oz.
and they equally as effective with the smaller 8 oz., 12 oz., 16.7 oz.
and 20 ounce bottles as well.Buy a few, as I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed!!.
The more that you do that, the greater the pressure.
I have yet to have one &#34;fail&#34;, meaning pop off like a champagne cork.
I drink diet sprite from the two liter bottles as it is cheaper that way.
But, you have to practically screw the cap back on with vise grips to get it to hold in any of the fizz.
I can almost count on it being dead by the next day.
However, this thing does what it is supposed to do.
This small processor is perfect for quick chopping and mixing.
Easy to take apart and clean in the dishwasher - except the motor (of course).
This is better than the Black and Decker unit I had purchased but it cost a lot more too.
Sometimes you just need to buy the better and more expensive unit to start with.
My wife uses this constantly (daily) as a working mother.
She makes all our own baby food (sweet potatoes, etc.) in this thing and it works really well.
It's a bit loud but she only runs it in &#34;small bursts&#34;.
It seems to be a pretty powerful motor and we'll likely purchase another one once this one dies.
Cleanup is quite easy and easy to put back togther also.
The 1.5 cup size choppers are just to small.
Only drawback is the bowl and lid are thin plastic.
Also a wonderful size for a small counter top.
It is powerful and very easy to operate and clean.
works well to make soups, and even ground meat.
I finally found a small well made food processorthat chops food to the right size without crushingit.
I use it for a lot of receipies including pesto,great kitchen tool.
I don't even use a hand chopper any more - just grab this little item out of the cabinet and chop away.
It's small and compact, so stores in the cabinet well.
This item was needed to make small batches if foods.
Cuisinart always comes through with excellent quality products.
I love this food processor! It's small/compact, so it fits in my cupboard without taking up much space.
But I love the fact that you have a forward (chop) AND reverse (grind) option - very versatile.
Don't believe any of the reviews that say the blades can pop out of the food processor and hurt you.
Clearly someone was hired to do a hit-job on cuisinart, because the claim is just a load of bull.
This machine is quite safe with a very good safety locking mechanism.
It is impossible for the blades to damage the plastic container barring someone doing something foolish, like blending nut bolts or something.
If you push the chop button for more than 25 seconds, your food will likely resemble something blended.
The machine itself works quite well for its intended purpose, which is to chop and grind.
They tell you this in the manual, which you are suppose to read before you use it.
Leaving the power cord in the power will result in a much shorter lifespan and burnout.
This machine has lasted nearly a year for me.
If you expect the same power as the larger relatives you need to buy the more powerful units.
This works perfectly for mincing, chopping, pesto making, pureeinng avocado etc.
The Cuisinart Mini is a great little chopper.
Works fine when a large food processor is not needed.
I love anything with bright colors so of course I had to get me one of these food processors.
There are times when I need to do a small job, like chopping fresh herbs or garlic, and this is just right for that.
Saves me the time of having to hand chop!.
After much research I narrowed my choices down to the KitchenAid KFC3100 or the Cuisinart DLC-2.
The reviews for both models on Amazon led me to purchase this one.
That was a couple of years ago, and I still think it was a wise choice.
The base housing wipes down easily, with no crevices to collect gunk.
(The bowl can take only so many drops.)Only 4 stars? The bowl could be better quality material.
Grinding up some dried garlic slices left the inside of the bowl looking like it had been sand blasted.
Also, a place to wrap the cord would be nice.It's been around for at least 8 years for a reason.
If you are looking for a processor for those small jobs, this is the one I would recommend.
I'm so glad I found this mini-prep processor!.
The lid never fits well into the slot.
the blade has to fit Just So to make it work.
I had just about decided that chopping vegetables two knives held in one hand is most efficient.
It's high-quality and quite a deal for the price.
This is a great food processor for small jobs.
I have been using this processor almost daily for about 1 month and I am very pleased.
I have used it to make nut butters, mix desserts like fudge, and chop veggies.
It is a small cup size, but works well if you are making a meal for a family of 4 or less.
I love the colors of this product - it's also easy to use and it's really easy to clean and durable.
I bought this to make mayo and chop herbs.
Guess what?  It does both with ease, saving me loads of time.
I put a couple of slices of bread in it to make fresh crumbs for meatballs and it did that with perfection, too.
Perfection! This is so much better for small jobs than my full sized machine and I am really, really glad I bought it.
I am going to make a sandwich roll in it to bake off in the morning before work.
It is the perfect size for it!I don't really understand the complaints from some.
If you put an onion in the large processor it too will puree the onion if you don't know how to use it.
You don't whirl the food to death, you pulse on high a few times.
If you have a big chunk left, take it out for christs sake.
Besides, it only takes seconds to dice a whole onion so I really don't get why you would use this for that purpose.
Onions come perfectly sectioned to make tiny little cubes! Hard to improve on that.
This is the second Cuisinart Mini I've owned.The first one lasted about 5 yrs.
It still works just fine but I broke the lid, the keywords being &#34;I broke it&#34;  It wasn't caused by any defect in the lid.
I'm sure I'll get  5 yrs+ yrs use from this one also.
This chops food very fast and is easy to use and clean.
We like it so much we purchased this as a present for someone 94 years old and they find it easy to open and use.
This is a great mini chopper for prep work or light duty chopping.
But it is not meant for any heavy duty chopping.
I use mine for nuts, cinnamon sticks, herbs, softer vegetables, onions & garlic, etc.
that's what full size food processors are for.
I've even made small batches of salsa and hummus.It is a useful small kitchen appliance, and it is easy to store and clean.
This Cuisinart DLC-2ABC Mini Prep Plus Food Processor is definitely a must in everyone's kitchen.
I recommend it to my friend and family all of the time.
Anytime I want to chop some nuts, or make homemade salad dressing, or puree baby food I just whip this out and use it clearly.
I have used this to make hummus and chop up veggies for cooking.
Works great, easy to clean, but I have not had it long enough to judge quality.
It feels substantial and I hope it lasts, time will tell.
I chop oinions and garlic with this and it does it very well.
Efficient and very powerful for it's size, I love it!.
I read a number of reviews on these and have owned a number of them through out my cooking life.
It doesn't take up too much space, but it is powerful.
Someday, I will get a big food processor - but not yet.
You can even make frozen yogurt in this puppy.
The color is a little weird, like an old swimming pool, but I wanted something with color, so I don't mind too much.
This is the second of this unit we have owned over the years it does the job well and would recommend to others.
I hate to chop so found this little gem.
No tears! My only regret is that I didn't get a bigger one!.
If you want to make a small amount of slaw this works great.
I purchased this item for processing small amounts of veggies, etc.
I pulse the oats only about two or three times, and the cereal cooks more completely because of the small sizes of the oats.
Actually, the pulsing was a tip on the Irish Oatmeal website.
A mortar and pestle can only do so much.
This is a bit pricier and a bit larger than I would like, but boy has it got spunk.
VROOM! Like they weren't even there, done in three seconds.
Noise wise it's no worse than my Kitchen-Aid mixer, simply a higher pitch.
The vibration was minimal considering the power of the motor.
I've been cooking for decades, and I don't know how I got along all these years without this Cuisinart mini-prep processor.
After all, I'd gotten along all this time without one.
Plus I almost always read all the Amazon reviews before I buy anything, but there it was, on sale, and I had a coupon.
Mincing garlic - a job I really hate, but this little machine makes it fast and simple.
And bread crumbs - no more pushing bread slices back and forth over a grater.
Put it in the mini-prep, pulse several times (including the reverse pulse) - and there you have it!.
I wash it right away in soapy water, and rinse.
Plus, it's cute!I wish I'd had this decades ago.
If you are looking at it as a possible impulse purchase, I would recommend succumbing to your impulse!.
I bought this as a gift for a single man.
In fact, everything he did with this cut the time down to nothing.
It made me think about all the time I spend cutting everything.It is a very small food processor, and that's the beauty of it.
So little to clean, and very easy and quick to clean - a few seconds and you're done.
A man's dream come true, packed with a lot of power to boot.
I want one myself now, for chopping sauteed veggie additives, such as onion, celery, etc.
Don't know how well it would handle carrots, as I didn't experience that.
Truth be told, this is a must have, and I want one.
Small - minimun counter space keeps it where we can just reach for it.
Both quick and efficient - best at rough chop to lumpy puree.
But that's the kind of task we got it for, because we like to make lots of sauces and dips.
Easy to clean makes it easy to use, too.
A few years ago, I received a full-size Cuisinart food processor for Christmas.
After I found out how useful it was, it earned a permanent spot on my counter top.
I dealt with it for a long time and chopped things by hand as needed, and one day I saw these at Kohl's.
I immediately checked prices on Amazon and found a better deal here.
The day that I received my mini-prep, I washed and used it.
So much better than trying to pour at a constants peed by hand!!!The machine is easy to use.
The button on the left spins the blade in one direction, the button on the left goes the opposite and is maybe a little faster.
It's easy to clean up as well- take apart, wash (or put in the dishwasher, top rack), and unplug.
Again, I wish I had one of these years ago, but at least I have it now.
The wide variety of available colors is a plus, too! I love my lil' green Cuisinart mini food processor!!!.
Picked this up at Costco for a price that couldn't be beat.
It is a bit on the loud side, but since I use it mainly on pulse, the noise doesn't bother me.
The blade is very sharp and makes short work of the veggies.
I rarely have to use it for longer than 10 seconds.
It matches my Kitchen Aid Industrial Heavy Duty Blender to a tee.
& couldn't be happier with the way it works.
My husband wanted a small food processor to grind herbs with.
This little machine does what it is suppose to.
The only problem which is my own fault is some items will require chopping prior.
Otherwise, it gets stuck on the sides and wont get pulled down.
There is about an inch of space between the plastic part of the blade and the sides of the processor.
I made some amazing hummus as well as some awesome cauliflower crust pizza with this bad boy.
It's very powerful and does its job well.
My only regret is that I didn't purchase a slightly bigger one.
I didn't know that a 3 cup processor would be THIS small! It makes sense though and I try to use it for small things.
I love the color! I think it's really cute and a great little helper in the kitchen!.
Oops write my mini prep review on the dvd player.
It was bought for my grandson for Christmas.
This is a good appliance to tackle small and medium size jobs.
As a point of reference, it can process a 16 oz.
can of pineapple chunks or a 19 oz.
can of chick peas without breaking the job down into batches.I'm very glad I made this purchase.
If you are thinking this is something like a mini chopper, think again.
It is FAR closer to a food processor than a chopper.
I had no idea how powerful this thing would be, with the simplicity  of use and cleanup of a mini chopper.
This Cuisinart Mini Food Processor is a nice little unit for small kitchen jobs.
It has the Cuisinart quality and a good price on Amazon.
It is easy to clean and it cuts up food very well.
This is a nice addition to your kitchen that can speed up prep time and use up very little cabinet or counter space.
This has a lot of power for a small chopper.
Admittedly, it has been a couple of years since I have had a food processor -- and the last one was 6-cup capacity.
But for my current needs, this is great.
It has more power than some of the smaller ones I've owned and does not freeze up.
It is also a a beautiful cherry color and is compact enough to easily squeeze it into my kitchen cabinet.
This little chopper is ideal for the small jobs I want to do.
Has a nice look so it is not offensive while sitting on your counter if you have to leave out.
This little mini chopper is great for smaller jobs.
I bought it for chopping my fresh rosemary for my bread.
It does a superb job, so much better than the last mini chopper I had (different brand).
I cook for two people, and I don't do huge amounts of prepping vegetables, but I've always wanted a food processor.
My daughter got one of these and recommended it, so I gave it a go, and I am very happy.
Today I ground up raw cauliflower into a rice-like consistency, and it was super fast and easy.
But that has its plusses--it fits neatly on the counter next to the coffee maker.
If it has to go under the counter, it will collect dust.The motor is strong and the blade is sharp.
I am not certain how durable the plastic parts will be, but I will be careful with it.
It does seem that a small plastic part could snap off, rendering it useless.
It replaces my 22 year old mini cuisinart and is just as good.
It chops my onions perfectly, and I even use it to grind parmesan cheese and I am absolutely loving everything about it.
chops fantastic! love it! save me lot of work! as a grinder.
you have to block it 360 degrees by hand.
I am so glad I bought this item.
It is a great product and quick to chop/mix things.
I love it and would buy another should this one quit working.
I discovered it is not as &#34;mini&#34; as it looks, it prepared a &#34;press-in-the-pan&#34; pie crust very quickly.
No need to get the big processor involved.
I have this smart Mini-Prep Plus Processor  DLC-2ABC series in Chrome from my niece Stephanie S.
She knew I was looking for a processor but unsure when ? I planned to get one.
I really wanted a 13 cup like my sister's that I bought for her.
My mom said "I should get a smaller size for me".
Then to my suprise I unwrapped it and here it is.
I make shakes in this,I have onions chopped in here, and use this for helping make my cooking needs when needed.
This is the best kitchen toy aka extra hand for me.And after clean up I put all of them in the dishwasher.
It is a very cute little food processor.
It chops and grinds alright! It's bright and cheery! Will be a wonderful addition/gift to anyone's kitchen!.
It's usually &#34;just me&#34; & I've a small kitchen - so this is just the right size for &#34;those cooking needs&#34; times!.
I haven't used it very much since I haven't owned it very long, I actually haven't had much experience in the food processing department.
So far every time that I have used it, it works great and gets the job done.
This is a very tall skinny food processor so I was concerned it wouldn't be big enough but so far so good.
I debated for three weeks whether to purchase a three-cup or a four-cup mini processor.
There are a lot of reviews here, and while I debated this issue of three- versus four-cup I read many of them.
What?  Nobody else seemed to have the same debate going?  So, I guess, I'm adding a new thought here that someone else might find useful.
Well, yeah, it is--especially if you are comparing it to a full-size processor.
This machine is not meant to be used as a regular-sized processor.
Try to use it for a "full-size" job and no doubt you will be disappointed!I wanted a little processor to prep small jobs.
It needed to be handy enough so that I would actually use it.
It had actually become "extra" effort.I already have the largest Elite processor that Cuisinart makes.
The curved shape of the Premier is the shape of this little processor.
It makes for a smaller footprint; it is easy to pick up with one hand, and moves around the kitchen easily.
Two pulses in one direction and one or two in the other direction gets most of the jobs done.
It opens quickly and dumps easily, making it simple to change ingredients or do another batch quickly.
If you're shredding cheese for a 9 X 13 pan of mac and cheese, well then, get out your big processor.
If you're grinding meat for burgers, get out your big processor.
If you're grating potatoes for a big batch of potato pancakes, get out your big processor.
It's not a bright yellow, but it's not a soft, light color either.
It's got a bit of mustard yellow to it.
Still, it's not bad looking in my kitchen that needs pale colors.
Great chopper! This does the job of a much larger food processor with a much smaller footprint and price tag.
We've given several as gifts, they're great and come in such fun colors!.
This processor is my first one so I am experimenting with it.
It appears to work fine, and the color is nice too.
However, it doesn't do thick type sticky foods well (like peanuts to make peanut butter, etc).
It works great as long as you only put about 2 cups of stuff into it.
Any more than that and the food starts to clog up the blades.
Excellent for things like small batches of salsa and the like...Not the easiest to clean, and sometimes more hassle than it's worth.
overall, though, I think it's a good product and would recommend if you are in need of this type appliance.
This is my second copy of this very handy and handy-sized food processor.
The big deal here is the blade reverses (using a touch pad key) to both chop and grind.
The reverse direction also reorients the product being processed so it doesn't just ball up or cling to the sides.
I use something else (powerful and smaller) to mill spices.
This can do the work but the bowl is too large for fine milling.
I am so glad that I got this.
It is the most handy item that I use.
I am by myself and it is the perfect size.
But itis so quick anyone would really enjoy using it.
It has been working great and I can anticepate it will for years to come,  it's a Cuisnart!.
I bought this to replace a really cheap mini chopper I bought at the grocery store.
My boyfriend makes palak paneer a lot and broke my mini chopper, so I browsed amazon for a replacement.
This works well for light loads, though I wouldn't chop chocolate or maybe even nuts in it.
I am a little worried about the durability of the plastic but I will just be careful with it.
She needed something to help her in the kitchen that wasn't too difficult to operate or clean.
Oh and her favorite color is yellow so this was a great gift for her.
I've always been fond of the mini-sized Cuisinarts/Food Processors since they are so much easier to clean.
This little Cuisinart is powerful and a useful tool in my kitchen.
Set up is a snap, and clean-up takes seconds.
It is perfect and easy for mincing garlic, herbs, and even harder foods like nuts.
I have used it to grind raw cacao bits into powder, make a small batch of pesto and many other uses.
My only complaint is that it only comes with one blade, so it does not work to dice vegetables.
I owned a non name-brand one cup food processor that died within a year.
My Cuisinart Mini-Prep Plus has been used heavily for several years and is still going strong.
Even if you only use it to dice garlic, it is worth owning.
You get to control what is in the food.
Without the preservatives that is in baby food at the store.
So remember that it is ok to go off the baby shower registry, and the parents will be so happy you did.
Great product except that I wish it could be used for smaller amounts of stuff.
I don't have any other brands to compare it to, but everything seems to work well.
I mostly use it to puree veggies, cooked and raw.
I think if you wanted more of a diced product, it would be more of a challenge.
I've bought these mini-preps for years and use 'em all the time.
After a couple of years of use, the motor warms up too much and there's a smoky smell.
But that's only because I've used these for heavier work than is recommended.
Having said that, the mini-prep featured here is re-styled and seems heavier-duty than those of years past.
The work bowl is a little bigger than previous models.
We make hummus, peanut butter, sauces and more.
It is a kitchen tool that will not go unused.
This is a great little food processor for making home made baby food puree.
Cleans up well, sharp blade and powerful motor.
I love it when I am preparing something that doesn't require my larger food processor.
We bought this item to replace an older, larger food processor from Hamilton Beach which died after many years of service.
This little rascal is great!  We're just cooking for two, so it's plenty big for most all of our needs.
The secret seems to be to pulse the cutter using the "chop" button.
(Just like the directions tell you to!)  If you let it run, you'll turn your ingredients into a puree.
(That's French for mush!) Of course, if that's what you're after, go for it.
Easy to use, easy to clean, and just what I was looking for when it came to specific needs.
This chopper is certainly handy for chopping just about anything.
It is worth it to never have to chop onions by hand again, Simply quarter them and let this little guy do the rest.
I do wish sometimes that it could hold slightly more.
This little mini food processor was purchased to replace my old, warn out, little Oscar.
The plastic container has a bit larger capacity, which is nice.
The blade seems a bit safer and easier to handle for cleaning.
It definitely mushes things, but I want a consistency....I will work  on my skills  of figuring out how to work.
Another son and his wife observed this attempt to chop up some Thanksgiving turkey at their house and introduced me to their mini-processor.
After we got home I immediately ordered this one from Amazon.
It's larger, but I chop up more at one time and freeze separate portions to reheat.
It was shipped fast and came in about two or three days.
We got this to replace a mini-processor that was lost in a move.
We still had ourbig food processor, but sometimes, you just don't need to haul it all out!This one works like a dream.
I bought a 10-cup processor and this one.
There's just two of use to cook for, so usually I just need a couple cups of sauce, veggies, etc.
This does the job fast, looks good, takes up hardly any space and is a dream to clean.
This is a great addition to the full size Cuisinart - or for small households as ours has become.
It processes quickly - 2 seconds for deviled eggs.
Easy to clean or use the top rack of a dishwasher.
I am a household of one and usually I'm only cooking for myself, so the size is perfect.
Don't even bother with veggies with a high water content like celery or cucumber as it will turn them into a puree within seconds.
Otherwise, I love this for soup ingredients, herbs, making dips, etc.
Yes, it's loud as others mentions but it's much quieter than my blender.
I would give this product 5 stars if it held more food.
I know, I know, I purchased a MINI-prep, I should expect it to only process small jobs.
The thing I didn't realize though, is that you can't really fill these things to maximum capacity or even close to it.
You can fill it about 2/3 full before it starts to not process well.
All that being said, this thing is the BEST for very small processing jobs.
A cup of nuts, salad dressing, sauce for rice bowls.
For those things it works GREAT!  The light green color is exactly what I wanted and matches my kitchen perfectly.
It is simple to use with only 2 buttons - although I don't see much difference between the chop and grind button.
They are helpful to alternate though, as it reverses the blade and keeps things from getting stuck in the processor.
For a mini processor, this thing is great.
Don't expect this thing to do anything more than a small job and you won't be disappointed one bit.
When they come out with the papa version in the same color, I will be the first to buy it.
It has one speed, two gears, and a pulsing action that requires you to hold the button while it runs.
This is a pretty basic food processor.But if a pretty basic food processor is what you need, consider this one.
It runs efficiently, stores neatly in a cupboard or under the sink, and cleans quickly because it lacks nooks and crevices.
Some people don&#8217;t need numerous bells and whistles; student cooks, bachelor apartments, and other people with simple needs could benefit from a chopper this uncomplicated.
Living alone, I mainly need to chop onions and celery, grind potatoes, and do other simple kitchen tasks.
If that&#8217;s you, and if you need something focused more on being cheap and useful than artistic and gourmet, give this one a shot.
I never use my big food proceesor and we sent the blender to goodwill.
We make smoothies and jusice drings in this and chop herbs, garlic and make quick sauces.
I bought this Cuisinart as a replacement to a Kitchenaid mini-prep food processor.
I used it the first time and fell in love.
It is small and compact for those quick chopping jobs.
It chops perfectly and it is quick and easy to clean.
This is a great food processor for small jobs.
I use mine for onions primarily because my eyes can't take them.
You still have to cut food up into manageable pieces but does a good job.
This is a very good processor and it's a welcome appliance in my kitchen.
Easy to use, easy clean up, and just the right size for my purposes.
nearly 10 years, i use this to grind/chop up meat, yup i grab chuck steak and have my own fresh ground meat.
i do sharpen the blades with a few dmt diamond files in order to keep the blades sharp.
I've been putting off getting a mini prep appliance for a long time.
I've been using my standard size processor for everything and was finding it a bit oversized for many of my uses.I LOVE this mini prep.
It's powerful, the container is a great size, and it makes great spreads.
Sure, it doesn't chop everything evenly, but in 30 years, I've yet to find a machine that does, large or small.
You pulse, and move things around a bit.
It's just a fact of cooking life.We'll see if this machine goes the distance as far as years.
So far, so good and I'm very glad I bought it.
This lil guy is perfect for chopping garlic, making fresh salsa, or other small chopping/pureeing jobs around the kitchen.
To tired to get your food processor out? Just have a small job? This is perfect.
I use it for small batches of sauces, pesto and of course chopping up nuts.
Wish that it had a feeder tube but you can work around it for the compact convenient  size.
I've had this machine for over a month and so far I am very pleased.
I snagged an orange one when they were on sale for only $30, what a deal.
It's very powerful for such a little machine.
I've been very surprised by the versatility of it, especially when you consider it only has two settings.
The forward/reverse action is helpful to get things more consistent without having to open the lid and push things down manually.
to put into diced tomatoes or avocado it's awesome for salsa and guacamole.
This blender is a great addition to a small kitchen on a budget, and has been a great workhorse for me.
I've not had any problems with it so far, but there are a few things to note.
First, it is small (which I knew when ordering) so expect that sometimes you'll have to do your chopping in batches -- no big deal.
Second, and maybe it's just me, but to me the only difference between the outcome of &#34;chop&#34; and &#34;grind&#34; seems to be.
well, nothing, except that I always use both to blend the mixture a bit in one direction, and back in the other direction.
Love the size, just right for preparing inf two and the color goes well in my purple themed kitchen.
Perfect for just the two of us! Fits nicely on top of our fridge.
this little machine is awesome!! I use it all the time and its so small that it just pops into the dishwasher no problem.
I&#8217;ve never used one of these before, and was afraid I&#8217;d hate the cleanup.
Actually cuts way down on prep time without adding the time in on the back end!.
I really expected a lovely brushed chrome finish and  that is my ONLY complaint.
i wonder if this size will be available in a brushed stainless steel finish in the future, which would be a stunner.
We will be keeping this as every other chopper out there is either too large or too small.
Only the two speeds but meets the challenge.
I couldn't make soup ingredients or frying vegetables without it.
Just like the big one, only little, colorful, and easier to pull out and put away.
I had one of these for about ten years and the blade broke after putting it in the dishwasher.
When I priced a replacement blade, I decide to order a brand new Mini-Prep.
It is smaller than a normal food processor but for myself and husband, It does the job quite well!.
Once I figured out that it locks and then works, I was a happy camper.
I wasn't locking it in place, so it wouldn't work.
Good thing I figured that our before sending it back as defective.
This is one of those little gadgets that you never knew you needed, and once you have one you can't give it up.
I could go on forever.One star off since the motor isn't quite what I'd wish for it to be able to handle.
In other words, some ingredients will slow this baby down to the point where you'll smell that smell.
You know the one: electric motor about to burn out smell.
So don't overload it and keep things moving about in the bowl and it'll be fine.
I've had mine for a few years and it's still kicking.
That said, I don't think that the retail of $60 is a fair price.
But for one or two it's the perfect size.
Sometimes it takes longer for me to chop everything than it does to prepare the actual meal.
Does a great job on everything I've thrown at it.
Read the instructions or you will wind up liquefying.
the base of the machine is colored plastic, not metal.
as other reviewers have noted, the container and parts are made of very flimsy plastic.
that said, this machine does a good job of chopping, grinding, and pureeing.
It will hold a lot more food than you would expect.
I love how fine it chops up ground beef for sauces.
I got this mini food processor sometime late 2006 and I'm still using it to this day.
I use this on a regular basis to make pesto sauce, hummus, salad dressings, whatever.
This has really held up all these years and it's still working great.
I would buy this again and definitely recommend it.
Making small chopped salads, soups, or dressings has never been easier.
Also, this little gadget is easy to clean and assemble.
This food processor comes with a cute mini spatula that is useful to scoop all the extra bits out.
It is a bit smaller than expected, but it is still powerful and excellent when cooking for 2-3 people.
Also it can also make the items liquidy.
Which is great if your are doing puree..of some kind.I give it 5 stars!!!!  I would for sure recommend this product to anyone!.
Because of other reviewers, I was warned not to sit on the chop button or I would have puree quickly.
So I just pulse when I am chopping and it works great.
I like the smaller size because it is easy to get out of the cupboard and quickly set it up.
It does a much better job than my old Black and Decker mini chopper, which I loved also because of the convenience.
The blades are much better on the Cuisinart.
The only thing, is that I didnt realized it was mini, I wanted a bigger one because i do cook a lot.
This food processor works very well, almost too well for its size.
I wish the lid would seal better, but this seems to be a problem with any food processor.
It is also plenty powerful, but you have to be careful not to over do it.
This 3-cup food processor is perfect for my needs; it would even work well if cooking for more than one person.
I enjoy using this for prepping and am very pleased with my purchase.
but has racked up a few negatives in it's short life at our house.
The motor is not as strong, and labors a bit, even when performing light tasks such as blending shelled nuts or cereals.
I have owned an old 10 cup Cuisinart for almost 30 years.
While it still runs perfectly, it's a hassle to move to the counter, so I rarely use it.
The mini-prep model has a blade that you remove from the stem--a dicey process.
Blades are sharp and job is done quickly.
This is a great little Mimi-Prep food processor from Cuisinart and I love the pink color.
It is a real time saver in the kitchen.
given as gift-loved it-our raditional Christmas cookies require a lot of chopping of dry fruits-this does the job just right.
I bought this at Costco as an impulse purchase knowing that if it did not live up to my expectations, I could return it.
Using that alternating method yielded very evenly sized chopped vegetables.
Why potatoes? Because their starch content makes them naturally sticky and therefore a challenge to chop evenly.
The onions, as well as the peppers were chopped evenly and without any 'mush'.
I was able to create a rough chop as well as evenly diced veggies.
The potatoes surprised me and chopped equally well.
The nutmeg was tried to see how it handled a very hard item and to see if I could use it as a spice grinder.
The result was evenly chopped nutmeg, about the consistency of coarsely ground coffee, not fine enough to use for baking and a little bit uneven.
You could use it to create very finely chopped nuts but not any smaller.
The good thing is, it doesn't turn veggies into mush.
I even tried crushing ice with it and was able to get a fairly even grind.
However, the weight of the ice cubes and the force created by the blade actually caused the blender to 'hop around'.
I needed to hold it down while grinding.
Anyway, the size of this is perfect for us.
Anyway, I was actually surprised by just how efficient this little processor really is.
It definitely works as well for us at home as my Hobart works for me at work.
It doesnt see daily use, so I imagine it will last us for years to come.
Also, it is pretty silent as far as these things go.
The design is simple, and as inferred earlier, it doesnt take up any space at all.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
This has been used heavily in my kitchen since given to me as a gift five years ago and is going strong.
I chop blueberries to put in my husbands pancakes on weekends, so I use the machine probably three or four times a week total.
It's a cinch to clean, I brush off in the sink, then toss into dishwasher the parts.
I don't know how I could ever go back to living without it.
I usually use it to chop frozen mixed fruit to add to cottage cheese or to chop carrots.
It does a great job and is holding up well.
It's cute, small and excellent for single serving portions.
Just make sure not to overload it otherwise it will give you mush.
The reviewers I relied on were absolutely right: this little baby is FAR better than its KA or B&D equivalents.
This Mini Prep Plus is perfect for the small jobs you do while cooking a meal and takes less time.
It's a bit darker than my aqua kitchenaid but it matches beautifully in my kitchen.
I've used it to make pesto and to crush almonds to make homemade french macarons.
I use this small food processor all the time.
I purchased several as gifts and everyone likes it.
I am able to finely chop the carrots and onion in a matter of seconds.
I've used it a few times and am happy with it.
It replaces an older model, but seems more powerful.
Follow the directions or you may be disappointed with the performance.
Very simple to use.Chop the food up real nice.Sure beats the GE that I had before.
I don't use it everyday or anything, but for dips, butters, etc.
Mine worked fine upon arrival and still works well.
It's small but not too small and it's easy to clean up and the color is nice.
I'm so glad I purchased this after reading multiple reviews.
It does chop fine, so using the pulse is important.
I needed a food processor and found this little one.
It works well and I am not disappointed.
Purchased this item to grind nuts and chop veggies basically.
I love it, no complaints here and easy clean up.
I did purchase it when the green one was on sale for about $31.
It does EXACTLY what I wanted it to do.
long over due purchase  I have not used yet but know I will love it  Cuisinart is a known name for a great product.
Nice little unit - so nice, I bought one for my dad.
Less time preparing an dmore time with the guests - you need one of these puppies.
There's a nice coriander-pepper dressing for crab, and a quick bit of shallots to be minced, so I'm off to use mine.
It holds just enough for most everything I want to make and I just do two batches if I need more.
The only problem I've had with it is that is sometimes leaks around the top.
I now hold a towel around the top seam when I have liquids in it, but i'm not thrilled with the splattering.
Also, it doesn't really chop nuts, which is something I had intended to do.
It grinds them up into a powder.Overall, these are just small quips and it works well with a powerful motor.
I had the Kitchenaid one before, and it was a little better.
it clogs up easier than the Kitchenaid model.It is very easy to clean, and very powerful.
If I were to buy it again though, I'd get the smaller, original Kitchenaid one over this.
I never really though about using food processors for a long time although they seem to be a staple in the cooking world.
I always found that chopping and blenders would be sufficient.
You also cannot tax is much since after a few minutes of use it starts to have a slight burning smell.
It works, and the price is not bad though.
I like that the blade reverses thus getting the chopping or grinding done quicker.
It does have a chop button and a grind button.
I chose the key lime color and really like it.
There are other colors and it was hard to choose which color I wanted because I liked them all.
A time for every seasoning......and a utensil for every purpose.
The Cuisinart Mini Prep does not serve well as a primary processor for heavy jobs.
That was not its intended design, or function.
For many years they have been contributing to my cooking enjoyment as a problem-free, complimentary team in a busy kitchen.
It performs equally well making pesto, creamed butter, chopped fresh herbs, including garlic, chopped nuts, small portion purees, deviled eggs, spreads, and speedy fresh salsas.
It has a fast and slow lever whose function I like because they may be "pulsed" on and off with an instantaneous response.
I especially love the function of the two (tiny) holes on the lid, along with the ease of the lid's removal for ingredient additions.
We gave this to our son and new daughter in law as a wedding gift.
The have the Rachel Ray cookware and this went nicely with it.
It can handle anything!  I chop everything in it like nuts, onions, celery, tomatoes, jalapenos....and it literally takes seconds.
I can have 3 different things chopped, and the chopped cleaned and put away before I can chop one onion by hand.
I have had my Cuisinart mini prep chopper for 7 years and it's still working.
Cuisinart is an outstanding company and stands behind their products like none other.
I had had my chopper for about three years and accidentally dropped the lid and broke a piece off.
It wasn't a crucial piece but it just didn't look nice.
I did not buy mine on Amazon, but picked one up at Sam's Club.
I love this small food processor so much, that I could easily sell them.
I will never be without one of these.
No need to lug out your large food processor if you don't need a large amount.
Chop veggies, make bread crumbs, great for baby food.
I'm a  stay at home Mom of 34 yrs who cooks all the time.
This small machine is a needed item in any kitchen where someone cooks.
The Cusinart DLC=2ABC Mini-Prep Food Processor in Brushed Chrome works great.
It has handled everything so far that I used it for.
I bought my Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus a few weeks before Thanksgiving, after living without any kind of food processor for a few years.
Then I volunteered to make cranberry relish for our large extended family Thanksgiving dinner.
From fruit to nuts, it performed like a little champ.
I chopped small quantities of ingredients, then combined them in a big bowl.
And I used a lot of pulsing rather than continuous grinding or chopping.
I need a processor but don't have room to store so I tried this mini processor.
It works great, just in smaller quantities, which is fine since it's just me.
We will use it next time we have a small job to do; seems well built and easy to clean.
I bought a new cookbook that called to use a food processor.
I found this one at a decent price.
Very useful and I even made homemade almond butter (although it took longer than the directions), but it worked.
This mini food processor is great if you don't have a lot of room in your kitchen.
Ours has been going strong for 3 years and we use it constantly to grind hard cheese.
I replaced the exact same item because the plastic that retains the blade cracked.
It was probably 10 years old, so lifetime was adequate.
Surprisingly loud when operating and doesn't seem to grind coffee fine enough to brew right out of the chamber.
Other than that it's a great product and does mostly everything else well.
I like the rich color finish on the outside and seems like a high quality product right out of the box.
I have always wanted a food processor, but could not justify the size or expense for just little ol' me.
One day I was wandering around Amazon and happened across this little fella in a variety of colors.
After some help from the Amazon community to find out if he would chop garlic (yes), I bought one in sugared plum.
I put him to work last night while making stuffed mushrooms and he did his job perfectly.
He was also very easy to clean up afterwards.
I was always reluctant to cook because I hated chopping, even with my hand chopper which was annoying to use and clean.
This makes cooking (well, the chopping part anyway) a pleasure.
The bowl is small and things must be chopped in batches, but that works for the limited use it gets in my kitchen.
That said, it does work really well and is very easy to take apart, clean and put back together.
If you really need to chop large amounts of veggies in a hurry, look for a larger processor.
This is a great little food processor for someone like me.
It really does a good job and is fast.
I especially like the way it chops walnuts for cookies & nut roll.
I am very happy with this small food processor.
It is just the two of us now so I gave my big one to my daughter.
This chops onions perfectly, just don't &#34;over do it&#34; Lol.
I like the reverse feature on the grind setting.
I got this as an adjunct to my larger food processor.
I don't like clutter on the kitchen counters, and it's easy to take this in and out of the cabinets for quick chopping.
I've used it to chop garlic, onions, make chutney, guacamole and salsa.
It's definitely not as heavy duty as the large machine but works well for small, quick tasks.
I needed something small for salad dressings and salsas.
I don't like pulling out the 10-cup processor for the small jobs that this little processor can handle for me.
Moreover, I discovered last night when washing the blade that it is super sharp.
Finally, homemade hummus again!  I can finally get through the &#34;stages of grief&#34; for my much-loved, long-deceased Oscar.
I like this mini-chopper so far after about two weeks of use.
I replaced a smaller chopper that is about 1/3 of the capacity thinking I would like the extra room.
That obviously has a practical impact on how the blades affect what they are processing too.
On the whole, I think this is a good product that I would recommend.
They only reason it's not 5 stars is more personal preference.
I might look for a two cup capacity (this one is 3 cup) if I were doing it over.
It will make a great Caesar dressing and do just what the manufacturer recommends.
The sauces are emulsified whereas a sauce blended  by shaking may quickly separate.
Some time ago, we purchased the top of the line Cuisinart Food Processor and at the time, they through in a free Mini-Prep.
Seems as if whenever we are cooking we grab this handy little machine to make fast work out of chopping just about anything.
It works great on veggies, garlic, and even nuts.
Plus, nowadays it comes in just about any color you might want so it looks sharp on the counter too.
For small amounts, no need to haul out the big food processor.
Perfect for salsa's and for mincing onions and garlic for dishes.
I think I will use it often when I cook more.It arrived on time and in good condition.
It's a small machine, but super powerful, and does the job right.
I use it for chopping small items like garlic, onions, or sometimes even peeled shrimp.
I love it because it does not take up any counter space, and it's very handy, hence the name "mini-prep".
I've been using it on a weekly basis for over 3 years, and it still runs great.
At age 82 I have my first food processor and I absolutely LOVE it.
I use it every day for breakfast to chop up kale which I warm up and fry with an egg!  Perfect.
It was easy to learn to use, easy to clean, and oh, so useful!  Thank you!.
I was given a small chopper as a housewarming gift about 16 years ago.
it finally gave out and I replaced it with this Cuisinart chopper.
It works like a dream!  I bought one for my sister also.
It can be a pain to prfreeze things but I would still buy this again.
This is one of the best machines on the market.
Maybe someday they will iron out the liquid problem.
My only regret is that I didn't buy this long, long ago! Happy sealing :).
I've paid for my Foodsaver over and over again.
It seals as tight as the "brick" coffee in the store.
Like others have said, find it a permanent place in (or near) your kitchen, so you can use it easily.
When opening bags, clip it as close to the seal as possible so the bag can be reused.
I've also had much better luck using the pre-made bags.
They don't leak like the ones you make from the roll.
Make a point to use it and you won't know how you lived without it.
I've sealed all sorts of frozen meats (per the instructions it works best that way) and baked goods.
I've also taken frozen veggies and transferred them to the vacuum bags, keeping the freezer burn at bay for quite a long time.
I can't speak highly enough of the convenience this has brought to my family!.
I picked up one of these at a local store and have overall been satisfied with it.
My main issue is with using larger bags.
I have a hard time getting a good seal, as it almost always wrinkles at some point, no matter how careful I am.
It often takes me two or three tries to get it sealed right.
Again, this is only with the really large bags that I had this problem.
So I often don't seal stuff that I could unless I have a number of items to do.
I'm not the kind of cook who buys gadgets that are advertised on infomercials.
I'm the kind of cook who keeps food in mason jars, and cooks it in a cast-iron pan.
The ginger and turmeric are in the fridge in a vacuumed quart jar, and have been for six weeks.
When our favorite organic chicken (Rosies) is on sale, we buy four, and stock the freezer with breasts and legs.
When we took a trip to Hawaii, our vitamins went into moisture-proof daily packages.
For sealing meat in bags, there's really no need to freeze first as long as the meat is reasonably dry.
I've dealt with customer service twice (over ten years and two machines), and they were great both times.
The only appliance in my kitchen that I use more often is the fridge.
OK so whats the big deal you ask.
well two of the biggest items to hit my pocket book and taste pallete is food spoilage and freezer burn.
I buy italian parsely usually costs me a buck something but NEVER use the full bunch.
This is a must have and will save you a fortune on the bags.
Seemed like a good idea but the cost sealing media turned me off.
So I went ahead and sprung for the Vacsealer.The postive side is that it is small and easy to use.
It sucks most of the air out and really seems to be working.
I did some comparisons where I stuck some meat in a regular freezer bag vs the vacsealer.
The regularly packaged stuff is starting to go and the vacsealer packed stuff is still doing fine.
I'm foraying into stews, roasts and other freezable items that I can cook in batch quantities.
So far so good.What I have learned-I use the pre-cut bags.
I tried the rolls but discovered I ended up creating bags the same length of the pre-cut ones.
Trying to get the bottom cut even to not "waste" bag material is frustrating.
When you have a fresh bag you can seal it about an inch or less from the top.
Sometimes I get air pockets if I don't arrange the food so.
Try to leave space around all the edges and no pockets in the food.-The seal is not always perfect.
I use it to store single use portions of meats and cooked meals for convinence.
Well worth it for that.If your thinking about it for meats or serving sized frozen cooking go for it.
Ditto if you want to do some LONG (years) term storage of Bulk grains or flour.
If you try to seal a liquid in the bag unfrozen, the vac will pull the liquid into the motor and ruin it.
I have had mine (bought REFURBISHED, no less) for several years, NEVER had any trouble with it.
If you try to seal a liquid in the bag unfrozen, the vac will pull the liquid into the motor and ruin it.
To thaw the meat I run HOT water in the sink and immerse the bag and leave it to thaw quickly.
Thinner meats like chops or some steaks thawing will take about 15 minutes and naturally thicker ones take longer.
I check by trying to bend the meat (still in the bag of course).
Carefully lower the bag to the zip line and seal it.
I've been doing this for years and have never ruined meat, ever.
It beats leaving food on the counter to thaw for hours or in microwave to partially cook and get tough.
The FoodSaver Vac1050 is my second vacuum sealer unit from Tilia.
An earlier model just wore out from constant use.
The unit works flawlessly and will pay for itself many times over.
My freezer is full of foods bought in bulk and separated in vac bags for individual meals.
I especially love the ability to seal foods in canning jars.
Coffee, brown sugar, rice and flour are just a few of the dry items that will retain their freshness in these containers.
And the bags are reusable even when used to store poultry.
A little dish soap mixed with a few drops of bleach will kill any bacteria that may have formed.
One suggestion on bags:  Cut the bags much larger than you need.
You can purchase food in bulk and never have to worry about spoilage or freezer burn.
It will be one of your most used kitchen appliances and you will wonder how you ever got along without it!.
This thing is wonderful and I use it everyday.
If you get the mason jar attachment though, it doesn't hold in the fridge.
The mason jars seal fine for storage of dry goods but won't work in the fridge.
The canisters seems to work well everywhere, however.
I have this item sitting on top of my Ronco Rotisserie (also from Amazon) and it is used every single day.
I sent it in and it was returned within a couple of weeks completely fixed-no charge except postage one way.
While I do not have this exact model, my Tilia vac system does what it says it does.
I've had mine for about a year now and, yes, food really does stay fresher for much longer.
For example, I buy large jars of sliced jalape&ntilde;o peppers for use on nachos even though it takes time to get through the entire jar.
The liquid always became cloudy and the pepper slices soft when I used the regular lid.
The best way to learn when to use them is to experiment.
The bags are easy to wash in the dishwasher (I turn them inside-out), though for some reason they discolor.
I've found the bags at Wal-Mart and K-Mart, so they are available if you need them immediately.
The cannisters are easier to get through Amazon than through the Tilia website.
They have other goodies that Amazon doesn't carry, but they aren't very good at direct-sales.
I have been using this Tilia for over a year.
I even found two quart mason jars to seal bulk items.
If I use a parial can of something I use pint mason jars to reseal.
Fresh fish will actually stay in the fridg.
up to four or five days instead of one or two sealed.Using the bags for freezing items is unbelievable.
No freezer burn.I hope this company never goes out of business.
I actually use these with a Rival Seal-a-meal vacumn sealer.
I've even re-used bags three and four times.
I hate to use more plastic, but love the results.
I try to salve my conscience by making sure I recycle all the bags when they're no longer usable.
I've tried using cheaper bags from Wal-Mart, and had nothing but trouble.
The Rival seal-a-meal bags actually work fine too, they're just harder to find.
There has never been a failure with this product.
It products for quite awhile and I feel very safe using the food from them.
I was skeptical at first because I thought the bags might be too small.
The bags are a big time saver over the continuous rolls and well worth the money.
They also make it very easy to repackage frozen vegies, which then keep much longer in the freezer.
Keep a supply of Foodsaver bags on hand.
I've been using the Food Saver system for several years.
It does a fine job of extending the expected shelf-life of stored foods.
The 1 quart bags are the size that are useful for a 2 party family.
These bags are very well made, and seal to perfection.
I may suggest one improvement...the seal line should be more adjustable so that the bag could be reused a couple of times.
You should be able to cut off the bag at the seal point, reinsert a food, and reseal the bag.
I've been using the FoodSaver for two years now.
Not too small, not too big, just like that story with the bears and the porridge.I still haven't used up that original roll.
I doubt I ever will given how well these bags are working for me.
I'm a solid fan of the FoodSaver, and these bags are just the right size for my needs -- a serving for two.
I also use the rolls, but frankly, the bags are a lot quicker if you don't mind the added cost.
I have had no problem with the bags breaking or not sealing.
Use it after after every grocery trip and the bags are great.
They are sturdy and hold up even though I tend to jamb things in the freezer.
They do not rip or tear and I can easily use my marking pen to write on the outside of the bag with content information.
Quite pleased and have been purchasing these bags for some time.
Since I buy really large pieces of fish, the gallon size bags are perfect for my use.
I bought a pack of Qt sized, a pack of Gal sized, and a roll came with the FoodSaver, I've never tried the cans.
Great products, much improved over the previous generation, if done properly food can last for years.
I don't like using the rolls as I'm usually rushed for time.
This size is so convenient for freezing cakes, bar cookies, bulk foods, meats, etc.
They are thick and so far I've never had freezer burn on anything.
I use it all the time and these are my favorite bags to use.
They are thick and hold up very well.
They're durable, a good size for sauce and larger quantities of food.
A little more expensive than the rolls of make your own bags, but worth the convenience.
If you want to store larger things and you have the foodsaver vacsaver this is the way to go.
Cost wise its pretty much the same as the roll but you don't have to mess with cutting and sealing.
Cutting it straight can be a real pain at times.
Unless your doing something really custom these should be big enough.
Note: be sure to clean bag entrance if it get messed up.
Also be sure to clean the rubber seal on the Sealer.
Just wipe it down with a wet paper towel.
These bags work great but are a little pricey.
However, I've tried the cheaper generic bags and about 25% of the time they don't seal properly.
I guess you get what you pay for.
(They're still expensive and I wash them out and reuse them for as long as there's enough bag left to reseal.).
Food saver bags are awesome, they do a great job in keeping meats and breads, or anything else from getting freeze burn.
These bags and all of the Foodsaver brand bags are flawless.
The only way they would fail is if they are being used wrong.
If you do Ebay you can get these same 32 count gallon bags for about $10.99 + $5.50 for shipping.
And sometimes you can find a seller that will combine shipping for multiple boxes.
I purchaced 3 boxes of gallon 32 cnt bags for $32.97 + $9.00 for shipping.
I have used them multiple times for things like corn on the cob.
Don't waste your money trying to save a few cents on no-name bags.
They work great and hold the vacuum well.
Not much to say, it's pretty standard foodsaver stuff.
Buy your meat when the prices are low, freeze them for years, then thaw and cook, with no reduction in quality.
Save a bundle, and eat Beef, Pork or Chicken any time you please, as long as there is electricity.
I've had good success with this for sealing the "soft" scuba weights that normally leach lead.
The trick is to use the manual vacuum mode so most of the air is gone and the bag is still soft.
If the vacuum is too strong the weight turns hard.
Some of my sealed weights leaked after several dives and had to be redone.
I highly recommend this for sealing your weights.
I package most of my foods in individual servings so this does the trick.
The bags just need to be cut to the correct length.
We use for the fish that we catch.
I like the fact that I can choose the size needed.
It is also cheaper to order thus way.
Great price for these replacement rolls for the Food Saver.
It was worth every penny and is so easy to use.
Being able to get more bags at such a reasonable price and with free shipping was great.
We use our food saver a lot for freezing our fresh vegetables.
This price is unbeatable compared to even the big box stores.
Cut to size and save money compared to premade bags.
Comes in multiple sizes to fit every need.
The rolls, for me, are  more economical than pre-made bags.
Contrary to a couple of other reviewers, I find the 8" wide roll the preferred size.
We buy hot dogs in bulk from a local packer and split them up into packages of 6 each and freeze them.
I also buy meat such as chicken breasts or pork chops in bulk when they are on sale and freeze them individually.
(Perfect for the 2 of us.) Less waste than if we used pre-made bags.
I prefer these rolls to the FoodSaver bags, as I can pick and choose how large my bag is.
I have been using these bags for several years now.
I know that they are more expensive than regular storage bags, but they are certainly worth the extra.
I can keep lunch meat for over 2 weeks in the fridge.
This large roll with the food saver machine is saving us big bucks on keeping food longer.
Never any freezer burn, and product comes out fresh.
Make your bags to size and cut out the waste of using a bag that is too large or not the right size.
I order these on Amazon because the price is more resonable.
In my house we home cook everything (stocks, vegies, and baby food) and we run through a roll in a week usually.
If you have a food saver you need bags,  whenever we went to the store what we went for was not in stock.
I really like the convinience of making my own sized bags.I've also sealed it in the middle (down the center) to make skinnier bags.
I bought the roll to see if I really could save by being able to cut my own size.
It will really be of benefit when freezing herbs - they take up very little space.
I also read that you can cook the food you froze in the bag.
I used a candy thermometer at 180 degrees to cook a 4 oz.
It was perfect! Moist and flaky - and I didn't have to use the oven! This is awesome!.
Keeps are food from getting freezer burn and makes it last longer in the fridge as well.
The rolls let you cut them to the size you want and cost less than the presized bags.
Great price to use to freeze veggies.We will get a lot of freezing done this time of year..thanks great seller.
I was making small bags for bacon where i would cut these in half and seal the open side before putting the bacon in.
Then I would put it in the sealer and it would seem to suck the air out but not seal.
It was the first and it's still the best vacuum bags around.
This is a must have in any kitchen.
I've been using a Foodsaver for many years and swear by it.
I can't live without my foodsaver!  I use bags and rolls.
This worked great with a food saver that I bought at a thrift store.
I got a really good deal on a food saver.
I have enjoyed using this product over the years.
It helps keep food from getting freezer burn and the food lasts a lot longer in the freezer.
I have bought many of these bags over the years and have not had one fail me at all.
I noticed a steak I sealed two years ago in the freezer and it still had no freezer burn.
I would recommend this to anyone who wants to save money and keep their food from freezer burn.
These rolls are great!  You cut off just what you need and make your bag.
i want to continue using these to save a great deal of money on food spoilage in the kitchen.
I just can't seem to eat it all before it starts going off.
Being disabled and difficulty making it to the store, I am glad to have these.
I love this product, but wish the rolls were longer!I tried a generic brand, but was disappointed.
Their rolls didn't have the marks to help guide a cut.
They also didn't have the same level of texture and it took longer to vacuum the air out.
Works well to cut our own bags to length rather than the precut style.
This allows us to use the bags with different products that we freeze.
This is the perfect design for the perfect machine!  The bags work great and are easy to use!  Great buy!.
they are just the right size! what amazing product, i now buy my groceries in big loads and save bunch of money!.
I find them expensive and am thinking about trying some other brand but these are high quality, effective and durable bags.
This product does what it is supposed to do.
There is really nothing else to say, nor would it be worth reading if I wrote it.
Had a bad experience with an off brand but have never had an issue with the OEM bags or rolls failing to hold vacuum.
I simply could not get along without the Food Saver machine.
Have ordered bags (different brand) and was so disappointed, would not hold a seal.
This order is my third for this correct brand.
These 8 inch bags are the size I use the most and I come to Amazon to buy the replacements.
We have owned a foodSaver sealer product for quite a number of years (1st one bought in the '70's).
We are now on # 3, only because we keep upgrading  and pass on our older units to other happy friends.
The sealed bags keep the air out, which means fresher food (no freezer-burn), and can go into the microwave, or boiled.
The manufacturer says that you can re-use the bags, but mostly we don't bother (I know, waste of money).
I am a repeat buyer of these products and have only good experiences with using it.
We live on a ranch and raise our own meat.
So we vaccuum pack a lot and for extrememly extended freezer storage times.
We wrap meats in ceran wrap, then vaccuum pack with this product.
Meat lasts in the freezer, at correct temps up to 4 years without freezer burn or bad aftertaste.
I have used these and they seem to be working good.
However, I put some salad in a bag,sealed it and placed it in my vegetable drawer.
After 2 days one of the packages had lost seal.
I can't find if there was a hole poked in somewhere but plan to try this again.
This size is economical to use for smaller items, such as fruits and vegetables.
The system keeps food free of freezer burn.
This roll (though pricey) is fine for what it is, but you can only make a bag the width of the roll.
I didn't realize that when I purchased this, as I want to make bags of different WIDTHS to accomodate different items that I preserve.
I have used these bags many times and have never had a problem with them.
We like the 8&#34; roll best for custom-fit bags (I don't even buy the pre-sized bags anymore).
After a while you get better at &#34;eyeballing&#34; the size of the bag that you need to cut, but it takes time to get there.
I love vacuum sealer bags, and these especially.
I've used the roll Food Saver bags for years since I can cut the length of the bag as needed.
You can decide what size you need instead of using a bag too big.
I would buy more went i run low.
When I received this product I noticed a defect  and called Foodsaver explaining what was wrong.
They advised me that there had been a manufacturing glitch and sent a replacement roll.
These bags can be washed and used over many times.
I wrap individual portions of meats in foil; place in freezer until solid, then seal several  foil-wrapped items in a foodsaver bag.
If you seal fresh meat  some of the juice gets squeezed out during the process.
I love my Food Saver and these 8 inch rolls are great for smaller or single serve pieces.
Nice to be able to buy without having to buy the larger ones at the same time.
We buy meat and fish on sale and vacumn seal it.
We then save money by taking frozen meat and fish with us when we vacation in Vermont each year.
This 1 roll of FoodSaver FSFSBF0516 8-Inch by 20-Feet Roll should last us until next year.
I tried some cheaper rolls and was very disappointed in the quality.
From now on it's genuine food saver rolls for me.
I bought the food saver for my daughter about a year ago.
We get alot of use out of it.
don't waste your money on buying one packs.
get these and store the rest in your closet or something.
Arrived on time.Easy to use but too much waste for an expensive product.They protect from freezer burn as advertised.
Since I live along these bags allow me to buy larger, cheaper portions and freeze.
I can take a cooked whole chicken I get from a take-out or supermarket and get three meals out of it.
I eat one portion fresh and have two more portions later.
I chose this rating, because I had a little bit of a problem getting this bags the right size and getting them to seal.
I have recommended it to some of my family.
I've had a FoodSaver vacuum sealer system for many years and it can be difficult to find reasonably priced bags to go with it.
I am very happy to have found the authentic replacement rolls at amazon.
The 11 inch and 8 inch rolls are both high quality and work great.
You cut them to whatever length you need.
The price is as reasonable as I have found anywhere.
I love my foodsaver system, it makes a huge difference.
It's great for anything from meats in the freezer, cheese in the fridge, to brown sugar on the counter.
It keeps brown sugar soft for years, which is really nice.I would recommend these bags if you have a FoodSaver Vacuum Sealer at home.
Use different rolls/bags for different types of foods.
Ordered several types so she could choose which is best for the item freezing.
We love our foodsaver and these bags work well.
You can cut them to be the exact size you need.
They also hold up well in the freezer.
Cheaper than retail stores, cut your own size is the way to go for freezing all different kinds of food.
Great product, hope they keep their price point.
I enjoy being able to make the bag the right size.
Saves a lot of room in the freezer.
The bags have a quilted texture which allows them to be light and strong.
I like the area on the bag for writing information about the food.
easy to use product that I sent to my daughter who uses it to store her de-hydrated food easy to use.
This roll will seal about 20-25 items, at a cost of about 50 cents each, not counting the cost of a machine.
For a prime fillet that's reasonable, but putting a single hamburger in one for easy access makes the package cost more than the content.
Love being able to freeze individual portions of lasagna or grilled chicken breast and thaw them out when needed.
I've been using this food saver system for about two years now and it's great.
Needed more for use with my food saver.
Much better priced then in the local store.
came fast, not much to say except if you have a food saver, it works fine.
This foodsaver roll is part of a Christmas present that we got for our daughter and her husband.
THESE CAME FAST, GOOD PRICE, AND ARE GREAT BAGS FOR SEALING FOOD FOR THE FREEZER.
NO PROBLEMS WITH THEM.WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.
Needed these bags for our food saver system.
They work well for the every day items you want to store or freeze.
You can't beat this price for these rolls.
If you own the machine, you'll want more of the bags to seal and store, for sure.
This is the best price I could find on this product.
Like being able to cut size I need for Alaskan salmon (15-20 lb.
Need good quality bags to keep fish from getting freezer burned - this is it!!.
I bought this to use with my new FoodSaver.
Which is more than you can say for the new clear colored canisters!!  They started cracking after 3 uses.
Before I bought my new Food Saver Machine I really was WASTING A TON OF MONEY with spoiled and/or freezer burned meats, etc.
I bought a new Food Saver Machine and bags came with the machine, just not enough of them for my use.
I have used these bags now when I buy in bulk and believe me, I am now SAVING A TON OF MONEY.
I love these bags because I can tell what is inside the bag, the date it went into the bag.
I don't ever want to be without Food Saver Bags ever again.
THANK GOODNESS FOR FOODSAVER BAGS and thank you Amazon.
These work well for packaging up &#34;single servings&#34; of meat, both raw and cooked.
I have also used for protecting things that need to stay dry, and re-packaging things like powdered milk for long term storage.
I use a sharpie to annotate description and date of packaging.
I cut parallel to the roll, and it works like a charm every time.
It's very economical to purchase from Amazon and in this case they had a better price then direct from Food Saver.
The cost is at least 50% more to buy the 'bag material' from retail stores.
It is so much easier to make your own bags because you don't waste them.
You can just cut to size and seal.
for hotdogs and smaller packages of products these bags were great..I will purchase these again, I know..it is the only way to go.
Tried cheaper ones and will stay with these.
FoodSaver is the only bags we use for our meats and vegetables.
like the fact I can select the length of the bag.
have not had the food saver machine for long.
so now that i have it, i am just learning how to use it most efficently.
baked goods are the most difficult to figure out.
I have a &#34;Food Saver&#34; vac bag system.
My food really does last a lot longer than &#34;zip lock bags&#34; in the freezer.
Amazon does have better prices than the local stores.
However, in practice we rarely use the 8 inch width.
I have used the bags and they are fine.
The one advantage the rolls have is that you can custom fit them to things that will not fit into the bags.
Choice is such a great thing!Also consider the canisters that are available to go with any FoodSaver that has an accessory port.
I use my FoodSaver all the time to store meat and leftovers in the freezer.
There is nothing better to keep the freezer burn off.
This is a great bargain for 3 rolls.
I purchased this as I was unsure if the FoodSaver machine I purchased at the same time came with a roll of bags.
It did, so I now have plenty! Love this item!.
Perfect size for most of my uses and easy to use.
There are only two of us so this size is perfect for saving dinner size portions.
I know they have to be cheaper than buying bags already donebecause I can make any size I want.
I ordered a box when I got my vacuum sealer unit and have been very pleased.
I get my herbs and spices in small quantities in bulk.
The rolls are great for sealing up small quantities instead of wasting quart-sized bags.
They're also great for freezing 1-2 lb portions of meat instead of using a quart-sized bag.
I highly recommend ordering a box when you order your vacuum sealer unit.
I had bought both the 11" and 8" wide rolls.
Definitely prefer being able to size the bags on the good, so the rolls are the right way to go.
However, we tend to use the wider roll much more, even for relatively small fills.
I had no idea just how much I would be using this size roll.
They fit perfectly for the smaller portions I like to freeze.
Also if I need a larger freeze I can just cut the bag much longer and get the same effect as the 11&#34;+ rolls.
My mother has a foodsaver and swears by the thing.
The prices on these were great, so she is quite happy and I am as well :).
You can write on it with a permanent marker.
If you put it in this special vacuum device you can use it to vacuum seal stuff.
Have used this product for years and always looking for a bargain...we process our own game each fall, could not do it without this.
These bags are sufficient thickness and quality, they work quite well.
I have ordered these 8" wide bags and the 11" wide bags and they really meet our needs.I would recommend them.
I have been using this system for a couple years now.
It is just myself and my mother in my home so we have to save what we can.
I get fresh vegetables and pack them in such a way to where it makes a meal for the two of us.
I then take it out of freezer, no freezer burn, and slice it while it is still partially frozen.
I have also stored items to take on vacation, hospital etc.
I keep a bag packed with new underwear, t shirts, tooth paste, tooth brush, deodorant basically anything you need.
I then put a dryer sheet in with the clothes to keep them fresh smelling.
This item is not just for food,  Be creative.
It also will season meats etc for the grill.
I LOVE my Food Saver and the bags are GREAT.
Good price, considering I can only ever get it at Kohls or bed bath and beyond which both require a coupon.
I was running out of rolls for my FoodSaver.
I like buying them from Amazon, not only for the cost, but for the free shipping I enjoy from my Prime membership.
So, I have the best of both worlds--my FoodSaver bags and the cost of purchasing them.
badly frozen food and spoiled cheese for years and years.
I food the FoodSaver system, and FoodSaver does what it says.
The Foodsaver rolls save us money, by keeping our food fresh and prevent freezer burn of our frozen foods.
We put all our meats and poultry in bags made from the rolls for storage in our freezer.
By buying in bulk we save money, and we keep our meats and poultry in excellent condition without freezer burn via the bags.
I purchased these bags to go with my seal-o-meal back at the end of November last year.
To save a little more I ordered them with S&S.;Since their arrival i have been sealing everything.
This is a must for the Vacuum Sealing System.
You need this special wrap when you use the Sealing system.
OK, I guess I could live without it, but I have definitely paid for it many times over with reduced food waste.
My only complaint is that the large bags (12" wide) are too big for many applications so I wind up wasting these expensive rolls.
These are brand name for the same price, after shipping, as the generic version.
You can cut them short or long so there is less waste.
I use on a regular basis to preserve my food.
I mostly cook in bulk and then package and seal for individual meals.
we always buy or food saver products from amazon.
we get good service &the product is excellent.
THE QUALITY OF FOOD SAVERS OWN BAGS ARE HARD TO BEAT.
THEY HAVE TAGS TO WRITE ON, FRONT AND BACK TO THE BAGS ETC.
YOU CAN FIND CHEAPER BAGS BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
I bought this for my dad as birthday gift and he loves it, it works great and was a very good value.
It shipped in a timely fashion and was exactly as described.
I can repackage all types of foods and keep them in the fridge longer, bags are also resealable.
Make your own nice for when the 8x11 precut doesn't cut it--for longer or smaller items.
8x11 precut fits the bill 90% of the time other wise and more convenient, but still need some of these around.
Save 20% with Amazon Mom & Subscribe and Save combined.
I have been using these FoodSaver brand rolls for several years.
They are made of very good quality plastic.
They do a very good job of preserving meat in the freezer for a long time.
I have written on this product several times and the results are the same.
I use my food saver all the time.
I prefer Foodsaver bag rolls for two reasons.
First, I get a lot more bags for the same price compared to pre-formed bags.
Second, I can customize bags to any length I need.My 12-year-old Foodsaver has no problems sealing the ends to create new bags.
For example, a full-size silver salmon fillet is too long to fit in one of the pre-formed bags.
I simply cut the bag to the length I need.
Likewise, I can also make very short bags for unique applications like freezing single servings of onions or peppers.Here's a tip.
I make my bags longer than what is actually necessary.
Be careful, however, not to fold or crumple the bags.
Doing so can cause small pinholes that will prevent an effective vacuum.
Work very well and of course love the machine so like the 8&#34; size the best as the machine comes with several sizes.
I am still getting them and would highly recommend  the machine and also this size rolls.
The bags work fine but the machine has crapped out after several months.
May look at a different brand food saver.
These rolls are the only way to go.
I make my own bags and these seal and cut easily in my FoodSaver(tm) sealer.
The size is perfect for the size and quantity of meats that I seal.
Save time running around trying to find the bags for the vac machine.
These are the official Food Saver bags that you can make as large as you like.We have since found them cheaper at Wal-Mart.
We loved ours so much, we purchased one for our Son as well.
I'm very pleased with the size of these bags and the amount you get on a roll.
I think they will last for a while and are a good value.
Otherwise, it's possible you won't be able to clearly read what you've written after the plastic distorts.
I only get FoodSaver because they have these special spacing pockets that make the bag very sturdy while ensuring the air is sucked out.
I tried the &#34;generic&#34; brands and was very sorry.
Food (especially if frozen) can pierce the generic bags or he seal is weak.
These are great, especially if you have a FoodSaver vacuum appliance.
I have the Gallon and Quart size bags but I also use these rolls.
The rolls are great for odd sizes, sometimes I want a bigger or smaller bag so these rolls are handy to have.
The plastic seems a bit thinner, but I've vacuum seals a good number of things and haven't noticed any problems with them.
I'll buy them again unless I find a better deal.
I have been using these bags now for several years and they are a huge money saver.
My Food Saver sits on my counter and I use it everyday.
Great prices for the bags; which I appreciate because I use a lot of them.
I havebeen using these for months now and the food I freeze always stays nice and fresh.
I am about to order more rolls very soon as I am getting low on the product.
Perfect size for my familyKeeps freezer burn off my food.
Nice that you can use only the amount you need.
Quite a saver instead of bags and for using for odd longer items.
I use these all the time as well as the larger size.
The whole system is great especially if you buy ahead and freeze.
This is also much cheaper than retail.I did learn that bagging salads is a great idea as long as I don't put cheese in them.
Great for nachos, not so great for salads.
My FoodSaver has been such a great purchase.
I got these bags as well as the 11&#34; bags.
I prefer the larger bags over these, as only small foods can fit in these.
The continuous roll makes sizing and cinch and there isn't any waste.
Bought a Food Saver Vacuum Sealer machine in November.
Bought additional rolls of plastic bagging material from Amazon, at a much better price than the store.
Have also frozen home made soups, frozen them flat, and easily transported it to work without worrying about spillage.
It also keeps other lunch items cold until lunchtime.
For a recent trip to a time-share we vacuum sealed coffee, instead of paying resort prices.
Also vacuum sealed some toiletries to prevent leakage.
I would highly recommend this system, and the bags, all available from Amazon.
I like these because I can cut any size I need.
It is very easy to cut and seal.
Checking things we froze and stored 6 months ago, there are no issues.
I buy all sorts of larger packs of meat and freeze them for single serving use.
I can cut these to whatever size to fit fish, beef, chicken etc.
I like this size best, I haven't found much use for any larger.
Worked very well with my food saver vacuum sealer.
I wouldn't buy any other brand, this product is top notch.
I found this product to be a great value and the service was great with this vendor.
Only time will tell if this is a product which &#34;costs too much but is worth every penny&#34; or if it is just plain expensive.
I used some this evening and all went very well.
This is the perfect size for packing bulk product down to servings for two people.
Also saved my Turkey and Ham from the holidays so I can make some killer Turkey Noodle Soup and Beans with Ham Soup.
With the proper vaccum syaten; these bags wil prvent freezer burn.
We buy ALL of our meat on sale and vaccum pack it!  Lasts at least a year.
Just like others that posted reviews on this item, I agree that buying the rolls is much, much better than purchasing the individual bags.
You are able to cut the bag to your liking and not be wasteful.
I don't see myself ever buying the individual bags again.
Great way to improve your method of preserving refrigerated,frozen & cured food items.
Everything I packed and froze is safe and free from leaking.
It does go quick and wish it cost a little less.
I have been using FoodSaver products for several years now.
I started with the pre made bags so was unsure about the rolls.
I bought a new machine that holds those bags and allows you to pull them out, cut them and seal them all in one.
I don't know how I ever lived without this product.
I have saved more money by buying bulk and packaging up my foods for later.
Without our FoodSaver we wouldn't be able to keep our food fresh from one meal to the next!  "No one should be without a FoodSaver".
If you own a Deni Foodsaver these are the bags to get.
They are clear so you can see what's in them and have a place to label or write on them too.
We freeze a large amount of summer produce from our garden and from our CSA subscription.
These rolls are the best way of doing that.
Not inexpensive, but definitely cheaper than the individual bags and more convenient by being individually sizable.
These are larger bags that work with the FoodSaver.
Like the smaller bags, they work...and that's about it.
The price was good, and came quickly though my Prime membership.
I like these for larger packaging such as pork steaks or leftover pizza.
Foods I don't like to package on top of one another in the package.
We buy meat when it is on special and freeze it in the Foodsaver bags we make from the continuous rolls.
Keeps meat from freezer burning and we always have meat on hand.
It cooks evenly, cleans up nicely and looks pretty, three of my favorite traits for bakeware.
When our last stoneware baking dish died, we were not happy.
Good stoneware isn't cheap and cheap stoneware isn't good.
This dish performs flawlessly.I cannot recommend it enough.
I use this dish for just about everything from casseroles to baker.
Looks beautiful for serving.DOES NOT ABSORB ODORS: %1 porosity.DO NOT USE ON STOVETOP: This piece was made to be Microwave, Oven, and Freezer safe.
I love to make casseroles in this and that is why I originally purchased it.
But then I saw it could also be used for baking.
Now this dish gets a double work out at my home.
My family is not large so small mixes work for me.
I really like the following brand:Dassant Cinnamon Chip Bread Mix, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)If you have not tried this mix, give yourself a treat.
And, then I love to eat what has been cooked.
What has been cooked in, then must be cleaned up.
At my house there are no little elves and fairies who do this, so I have been forced to cope on my own.
Then, I am able to get most of the rest off by just swishing water around with my hand.
The only thing I ever take a dishcloth, or thumbnail to, is the stuff that gets baked onto the handles or on the bottom.
I have to confess that most often, it is the thumb nail manuever that removes these unwanted baked on drips.HEATS TO BAKING TEMP QUICKLY.
and NO NEED TO BUTTER THE SIDES: Frequently I stick the pan in the Micro to heat it more quickly.
Usually, I get it warm by putting it in the microwave with a pat of butter in the bottom.
Then I add whatever I am cooking and pop it in the oven.
I do not have to wipe the butter along the sides to get them greasy, even if they need coating by a non-sticky subsance.
The pan butters itself as the butter rises up when contents are poured into it.
The next thing I got was the Rectanular baker.
I discovered that when I made cakes from scratch, I always added too much of this and that and had batter left over.
The small pan was a life saver for that extra.
I quickly found that it was the most used baking dish in my home.
I suggest you give it as a gift.
Sometimes it is difficult to think of what to give__________.
If they cook, this will answer your question supurbly.
As I mentioned earlier, I use Dassant mixes frequentlywhen I make cakes.
So, with two pans, I can make two layers at the same time instead of making one layer, then making the next one.
Square cakes seem to make quite an impression on people.
Seems like you have gone to a lot of trouble.
They are different and eye catching, so for fun, make someone a square cake!I REALLY, REALLY, LOVE THIS PAN.
I bought this pan for Thanksgiving for making a particular dessert recipe that required a 9-inch square pan.
It really is a beautiful pan, but the one I received has a sort of pinkish tinge to the beige.
I have other LeCreuset products, and none of them look quite like this.It's still pretty, though, and heats up well for cooking.
I'm slowly replacing my glass bakeware with stoneware for it's versatility and resistance to breakage.
Whenever I find a great deal on a piece of Le Creuset or Emile Henry, I snap it up.
We use it almost weekly for manicotti, enchiladas, cornbread, etc.
If it gets baked, in my house it usually gets baked in this dish.
I especially appreciate that it can go under the broiler.For baked goods like cakes and quick breads, I spray it with a little oil first.
For casseroles, I don't do anything to it, and still, nothing sticks.It cleans as easily as my old glass bakeware did.
I let it soak for a while, then wipe it out.
I haven't had to scrub anything, even when cheese was burned onto the enamel under the broiler.
If you're scrubbing yours, you're doing it wrong.
Again, soaking is key, but do not immerse it in the sink.Need another reason to buy one? Look at it.
Now picture yourself presenting a casserole baked in this pan to your dinner guests.
A frilly apron is a nice touch, too.
I own many items from the Le Creuset stoneware collection, and I must say that they are all of superb quality.
This square pan  is perfect for baking and serving my favorite side dishes and desserts.
I have been impressed over and over again at how non-stick the surface of this bakeware is.
Everything I have put into Le Creuset bakeware - brownies, casseroles, refried beans, etc.
- has come clean with zero elbow grease.
In fact, the dishwasher usually gets them sparkling clean without my help!  I highly recommend this product as well as everything else from this line.
I am not a fan of ginger bread but with this i can make rice crispy treat houses to decorate for all seasons.
I have made so many gingerbread houses!! They are so much fun and so beautiful.
I am thinking of doing a Valentine gingerbread house just to be able to use it before next Christmas.
They make my cake baking and decorating easy and fun.It made a beautiful cross cake for Easter.
No cake stuck on the pan at all.
the price was wonderful and easy to clean, I highly recommend this pan, you get your money's worth on this one.
I was making several other cakes, so I had plenty of batter and just filled it 3/4 of the way.
It is deep too so you won't get a skimpy thin cake with this pan.
The Cross cake pan makes a nicely formed cake! The customers really loved their cake! I couldn't have been more pleased!.
I liked the pan, but the cake was hard to cover in buttercream because if the angels.
If you use the star decorating tip to cover the cake would have been more work but would have covered the cross better.
This makes a beautiful cake and will be the talk of any event that you choose to take it to.
I purchased December 2011 this pan to specifically make a cross cheesecake with line of strawberry inside for Christmas.
Now, its pretty sturdy, its not like an aluminum disposable pan which can be bent.
So I use shortening cream to grease the pan for the cheese cake.
And most of the cake, which had a crumb bottom came out pretty easily.
What more can I say, its not a huge deep pan if some are wondering.
It served its purpose and its sturdy enough to get a lot of uses out of it.
Looking for a cross pan, I recommend this.
Pretty study, and bakes in the oven and does not warp.
Made a cake for our women's community ministry and it was beautiful!  Love this pan and plan to utilize it for many functions.
It's easy to use; cake comes out perfectly and it's easy to decorate and display.
If you want small cookies or clay dough figures, then buy these.
I have used the gingerbread boy and the holly the most.
The angel does not look like an angel after I cut it out.
What is very nice about Wilton products are that the edge on top where your fingers are is not sharp and is rolled.
This is exactly what I wanted to cut cheese into fun shapes for my kids' cheese and cracker snacks.
I tried to cut shapes out of grilled cheese.
It didn't work *great*, but they could recognize the gingerbread man and candy cane.
Some people have complained about how small they are, but that is specifically what I wanted.
When they first arrived, I thought maybe I had made a mistake.
However, I made sugar cookies and they were everyone's favorite! To compensate for its "mini" size, I made the cookie dough 1/2 " thick.
I will try to post some pictures of my cookies as they really were adorable.
I made regular sized cookies but mixed it some mini cookies for the "perfect" Holiday cookie tray.
I love these and they are the perfect size for what I need.
Creating small treats to put in Christmas goodie bags for teachers and co-workers.
I just want to make sure you make note of the size before ordering.
They are 1 1/2 inches long each and narrow but they make perfect bite sized cookies.
I bought a few to tie on Christmas packages.
I personally haven't tried one, but they look sturdy and feel nice in the hand.
The good thing is that they are of excellent quality, and should last forever.
I have most all of these types of cookie cutters now.
Now, I'm starting to collect a second set.
I do polymer clays and high fire clays.
These will be perfect for molds for making Christmas ornaments.
I have almost all of the Wilton Comfort Grip Cookie Cutters and I love them.
They are large and very easy to handle.
The cookies slide right out onto the cookie sheet with just a little nudge.
Also, they don't get bent or dinged up in the storage drawer as many cheaper cookie cutters do.
Wilton are the only cookie cutters I buy.
These are great and at a great price on Amazon.
I love that the comfort grip not only makes it easier to use, but color codes your cookie cutters for easy sorting.
Love the soft grip, makes it easier to push through the dough.
Wish they came in a smaller version too :).
I'm not usually a fan of &#34;comfort grip&#34; cutters.
They are easy to handle, and are sturdy.I use them every year at Christmas.
Delivery was timely (especially since the holiday season had begun) and the product great.
I have boththe Snowman and Icicle cookie cutters and absolutely love the cushioned comfort grip and size of the cookie(or other product) when cut out.
A number of my earlier cookie cutters cut out relatively small cookiesmaking for more difficult decorating.
AND the cookie recipe included with each cutter are really decentones.
An entire try of salt dough ornaments all individually different as decorated by your children.
With paper and fabric bits and mod podge they can give these snowman personality.
With white scrylic paint they can first paint them to look like snow.
Would definitely recommend this cookie cutter and would buy again!.
I use the 12oz and 32oz Bodum french press for making coffee and this grinder is absolutely perfect in size and quality.
I can grind three tablespoons for beans at a time in about 30 seconds.
If you need more dump the drawer and grind again.
It seriously takes less than a minute to grind six tablespoons for a 32oz french press.
Plus I enjoy that it look beautiful on the counter top and every one is always amazed by it.
I need a french press and espresso grind.
But its easy but not super convenient to adjust.
However all you have to do is remember the direction and how many notches to turn the adjustment wheel.
and always set it back to the normal or a default position.
No whiz bang electric dial though sorry just non breaking tried and true metal components.
Grinding for espresso grind does take a bit longer than for french press for the same original volume of beans.
I went through 2 electric burr grinders before deciding to try this Peugeot Bresil coffee mill.
The included instructions (tiny booklet with tiny print & tiny pictures) only go so far.
Instructions by others on this site help too.
I grind for each cup, and the flavor is superb each & every time.
The base jumps a little while grinding, but it isn't bad.
Got tired of throwing out electric grinders, none of which lasted a year.
The Peugeot coffee mill is the perfect solution.
Durable, consistent and a fun part of the morning ritual.
The one thing I'll insist on taking with me to the afterlife!.
I've had this mill for over 3 years now, and use it very often.
I find it very easy to select the grind I want, you can see a photo I posted early 2010.
To get consistent results, first I tightened the nut all the way (counterclockwise) and marked the spot with a permanent marker.
Adjustable grind works great for both auto drip as well as reg perk coffee.
I recommend thisProduct to those who appreciate quality.
You know it when you see it, there is no other like it.
I use mine daily and have for more than 15 years.
I've replaced the bird once, though I did buy several extras.
The first one broke after only a few months, but the replacement has been in use for the balance of the 15 years.
The shinny finish is all scratched from cleaning and the bottom needs a really good scrubbing around the edges occasionally.
There is some mildew build up in the rim on the bottom.
If I'd thought about it, I'd have moved it off the stove when I was cooking other things.
If it wasn't so expensive, I'd get another, but the one I have was a gift and hard to part with.
So, bottom line, it holds up well, does everything it's designed to do.
It looks beautiful for years, but you should take extra care to preserve the original shinny look.
Michael Graves, a designer and architect created this very famous Bird kettle.
The bird that is sitting on the spout is just too cute.
It is simply a great and fun design for the kitchen.
The bird is on my kettle only during its none working times.
Therefore I have never experienced the too hot bird on the spout.
And I would never forget that my tea water is boiling.
And if the kettles are too full it is always dangerous to pull the cap off without a potholder.
I've wanted this tea kettle ever since I first saw it many many years ago.
The whimsical yet modern design adds a great finishing touch to any kitchen.
The classic red bird whistle works just as you would expect it to.
I have admired this kettle since I first saw it in the '80s.
After I started drinking tea instead of coffee this winter, I decided to treat myself.
The finish is beautiful, the handle, bird and knob are just plastic, but attractive.
It heats fast with that wide bottom and pours beautifully with that great handle design.
My one negative is the seam where the bottom is attached to the sides collects water and it's impossible to dry completely.
(Yes, I empty and dry my kettle each time.) The bird makes me happy.
Because first of all this thing is 18/10 stainless steel which is somewhat hard to find in a quality tea kettle.
second of all, this whistle is decently loud enough for me to hear throughout my entire house as long as everything is quiet.
This tea kettle is worth the money because it will last you lifetimes and it is very easy to use.
The ergonomics are perfect for me, the handle is positioned so you wont get burned unlike some other tea kettles.
Also this tea kettle was in the movie "Crocodile Dundee" I noticed it one day while watching tv.
I bought the one with the ivory handle.
We purchased these bowls to go with our other Fiesta ware dishes.
They are a nice size for soup, salad, or pasta.
They match the other colors well and we use them often for many things.
We are very happy with these bowls and plan to purchase more.
fiesta has always been a favorite in our family.
they brighten up the table and make the food in them look great.
This bowl, like the luncheon plate (Fiesta) is what I consider the perfect size for me.
I have been using this for pasta, stir fry, chop veg salads as well as a "catch" dish for combo of meat/salad/fruit.
It looks pretty when filled to the brim but still has reasonable portions, i.e.
A little shallow for soups but it work for that also.
We use these for pasta, because the Pasta Bowls are just too big.
Unlike many Fiesta bowls, these are easily stacked.
My boyfriend likes the flatter bowls for cereal and stuff - I don't - so I bought this one just for him.
Does great for soups and cereal if you like these sorts of bowls, he loves it.
Have collected Fiesta pieces for daily use, about 15 years now.
Just recently found these rimmed soup bowls, and LOVE them!  They do dress up whatever is served in them, resembling restaurant-style tableware.
and the design makes handling to and from the microwave oven much easier.
As always, the vibrant colors and sturdy construction make this bowl configuration a long-lived addition to any household.
I expected a good product and that is just what I received.
We've collected the pearl gray (discontinued), black, and cinnamon Fiesta for quite some time.
I got 6 of theFiesta 19-Ounce Medium Bowl, Sunflower, but they're WAY too big for most things besides soup and big chili servings.
They look exceptionally pretty stacked together, and it's surprisingly perfect with the rest of our collection.
They are great and I have purchased from them multiple times.
These are less desirable glaze outcomes and Fiesta will not sell them at retail price.
You should just be paying a considerable amount less.Strongly recommend this size, and seller, though turquoise is my personal favorite.
I use them for everyday use and they do scratch a bit over time but that is to be expected.
These bowls are so perfect for soup and with the rim a place to put bread or crackers, salad, etc.
I have them in the Scarlet Red and they are just gorgeous.
I use the Scarlet Red and Black Fiestaware and these colors are so stunning together!.
The first one arrived broken (due to improper packaging) and it was quickly and easily replaced.
I really love the color and it fits a stick of butter just fine.
I get the Walmart kind (Great Value brand) and it fits perfectly with a little room to spare.
Love this butter dish!  I have it in scarlet and it goes so well with my red-themed kitchen!  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3.
I bought this to add to my Fiesta collection.
Sadly I dropped it a few months after I bought it and broke the lid.
Didn't really want to spend the money to replace it.
I still use the bottom part for butter since we go through it pretty quickly.
And I use it more than I ever imagined.
It is so clean and neat as well as utterly gorgeous in colour as well as such a pleasure to handle.
And my friends place looks so wonderful when he sets the table in the black and white Fiestaware, mixing plates, bowls, serving pieces.
It arrived in great condition and I am using it now.
My son complained that I did not have a butter dish in my kitchen.
I had gotten along nicely without one for a long time, but to please him, I purchased the Fiesta Purple one from Amazon.
I am very pleased with this dish, especially the handle on the top.
I looked at many without the handle, but decided it was best to have one.
No problems noted as of yet with this product.
It does fit the butter stick somewhat tight, but I didn't want anything big and bulky.
My wife and I registered for West Virginia made Fiesta ware through Macy's.
Unfortunately my wife broke the butter dish and I could not order it through Macy's for some reason.
This was the best deal that I found online and it is a perfect replacement.
That said, this is a wonderful little butter dish.
I've had mine for quite some time now and it's taken quite a beating from a toddler and still looks new.
The knob on top makes it especially nice and easy to use.
This is a great product and very pleasing to view as well.
I mix mine with my Longaberger dishes too and it fits in beautifully.
It washes up quite fine in the dishwasher as well (I use the top rack).
This butter dish arrived on time and in perfect condition.
This particular color of red is very pleasing not too orange or too blue.
This butter dish is another thing of red beauty in my kitchen now.
The dish and cover are a nice size without being too big.
I wanted a dish I could easily fit on the little shelf on the inside door of my refrigerator.
This butter dish easily stores a standard sized quarter pound stick of butter with room to spare.
The lid is just big enough that you can easily replace the lid on top without "shaving" the sides of the butter in the process.
The form of the dish is simple and attractive with nice curves designed into the lid and platter pieces.
The color scarlet is cheery and a joy to my eyes.
I am really loving my Fiesta kitchenware in the glorious scarlet color.
Fiestaware pieces don't have to be all the same color.
That's why it is a Fiesta to use.
Clean up in the dishwasher is just one more good thing about it.
Maybe it's because I am getting older but I enjoy all these fun things in the kitchen and dining room.
We house sat for friends a few years back.
When I opened their cupboard and saw a beautiful rainbow of colors, I was instantly cheered and intrigued.
Our friend had 12 place settings of Fiestaware in 12 different colors.
She had had them for 12 years and had only broken one plate, in spite of having two active young boys.
When I saw that they were used in a new restaurant nearby, I decided that they were, indeed, hearty.
I began collecting Fiestaware immediately and have never regretted it.
It gives me a lift each day and is fun to make colorful combinations for different seasons.
I have chipped on cup (what a fluke) and cracked one plate in half when dropped from about 5 feet on the cement patio.
We have dropped many pieces and are always amazed at picking them up unscathed.
I have even stopped getting out the delicate Christmas china in favor of using all my red and green pieces.
In the fall I use oranges and yellows and reds, in the winter I use Jewel tones, etc.
I have "happy" plates according to my grandsons.
unfortunately i broke the piece on top(: BUT it was a nice heavy butter dish..i plan on buying another one..the color is pretty.
I love fiesta ware so it's pretty much impossible for me to ever say something bad.
This butter dish fits a stick of butter perfectly.
The glaze has held up great to cutting of the butter.
Especially to my husband!  He's almost trained to treat all of my Fiestaware like it's very precious china.
As with all Fiesta this is incredibly beautiful! What more can one say about Fiesta Ware.
PERFECTION! I will continue to order Fiesta from Amazon!.
I like the very sleek design of the covered butter dish.
It has a wonderful slick finish, easy to wash.
Service for 8 and all I had was a tupperware butter dish.
This is very sturdy and matches all my dishes and accompaniments.
Can't go wrong with Fiesta-ware! This butter dish is very sturdy and well balanced as well as colorful.
I grew up on Fiesta-ware and everything lasted easily through my childhood.
Now, as an adult, it appears that the good Fiesta name continues to produce an excellent product.
My wife dropped the first one we bought, so we did not hesitate to buy another one to replace it.
Beautiful, colorful, my favorite color is the peacock.
A very rich blue, these colors in my kitchen just make me happy :).
I have never seen a butter dish anywhere that I like as much as this one.
It is a simple style but oh so pretty.
We were in search of a butter dish that would match some of our other fiesta dishes.
This went very well with both our blue and lemongrass colored fiesta dishes, very sturdy and makes everyone want to grab the butter.
Though I have found the long, &quot;normal&quot; sticks of butter here, they're not very common.
Maybe I should move back to the east coast so my butter will fit in my nice butter dish :P.
I ordered two of the Lemongrass Fiesta place settings, and they arrived two days later, completely intact.
I heard horror stories of these being shipped broken, or with major imperfections.
I don't know if I got lucky, or if this set was packed better than the 5 piece fiesta, but everything was in perfect shape.
These also did not have cracks or hard spurs in the finish, so they seem to be high quality.
All have actual Fiesta Brand stamps and markings, so they appear legitimate.
I will probably buy more in different colors when I have money and space.
Ordered other sets in a variety of colors - looks good to mix and match.
First wash in dishwasher left a bit of &#34;dust&#34; on the bottoms of the plates, but OK after that.
I went to Kohl's to make sure I was getting a good deal on Amazon.
This was a gift for a friend who is trying to get at least a ten place setting ofFiesta Ware.
Fiesta ware is going to be permanently on her wish list.
This is a great green! I have a nice collection and couldn't resist this set.
It looks better seeing it in person than looking at a picture.
I bought a whole set in various colors.
You just can't beat the quality of Fiestaware!  The colors are terrific.
and the assortment of additional pieces available is great.
My husband was sold on them (finally) after we visited his step-daughter and family recently.
She has had her colorful Fiesta dishes for several years, and they still look like new.
She has four children, so you know they don't get the most gentle treatment.
They are colorful, dishwasher and microwave safe and even ovenproof.
We were looking for a durable, cheery set of dishes for our staff breakroom and these are just perfect.
We purchased them in five different colors and also got the separate larger mug.
The cup included with the set is a bit too small for most people, but nice for coffee or tea at home.
Now we're building a house together..a house with a mother-in-law apartment and..we're doing the kitchens in Fiestaware colors.
Your kids will remember it for years and maybe your daughters (and grand daughters) will collect the same thing as their Great Grandmothers did!.
I ordered this dinnerware to go into our new Motorhome.
It was shipped quickley and was exactly as described.
I bought these for a beach house 7 years ago, and they are as good as new.
I love the color and quality of the dinnerware.
We use it everyday, and it goes in the dishwasher without any problem.
I am very hard on my dishes and have been using Corelle for years because of it.
But I really don't like the thinness of Corelle.
I have been buying different colours as suggested by many reviewers and I am glad I did.
Black dinnerware is fun; you can mix it with other colors for a casual but dramatic look.
And it goes with white and black checked tableclothes, graphic design napkins, red checks,  you name it.
The price is right--these are nice casual dishes with a bit &quot;more&quot; than the average design and a real classic.
If, like me, you enjoy simplicity and fuction as well as beauty, you will like Fiestaware in any color.
The dishes are sturdy and still graceful; beautiful without being embellished or ornate.
This is my first experience using Fiestaware and I am delighted.This four-piece set is a great way to start, too.
They are very durable, they come in a wide variety of colors.
The only thing I don't like about Fiestaware is the shape of the bowls.
We ended up buying deeper Fiestaware bowls separately.
Overall I am happy with how long they have lasted and if anything DOES happen to them I will buy these again.
It's nice to know that if I should break a piece it can be replaced.
A bonus with Fiesta is all the many colors that can be mixed and matched however you like it.
I bought these for my 95 year old mother with macular degeneration.
I mention that because it effects every aspect of her life.
She is a very sharp, vital, person but her cups were getting soiled and it was obvious to me she could see to clean.
I bought Fiesta because it was and is a nice medium weight white colored one person set.
with all the elbow grease and time you had.
I had searched online forever looking for an answer and finally found it.
Wrights Copper Cream Polish and everyone will think you replaced your dishes with new ones!.
I see other reviews complain about the quality of there pieces.
They are the good sturdy quality Fiestaware pieces that we expect from Homer Laughlin.
As good as any pieces that I bought at Khol's.
and beautiful - don't let the washed out photo deter you.
got this as a Christmas Gift for SIL, the shamrock 4-piece is just awesome.
I love adding new colors and this blue is just great.
I think that this was a limited run but as our dishes are all different colors, it works.
I needed two sets of the white for a Memorial Day/Fourth of July table.
I decided to buy a used set, which arrived in great condition not looking used at all.
I like the mugs rather than the cups and saucers, especially for the casual setting I was intending.
I have always loved these dishes in the store and finally decided to treat myself.
A lot of reviews said that the dishes had a lot of imperfections in the finish.
I look forward to using them for a long time and love that I can add to my set in the future.
Can't go wrong with Fiesta-ware! These dishes are very sturdy and well balanced as well as colorful.
I grew up on Fiesta-ware and everything lasted easily through my childhood.
Now, as an adult, it appears that the good Fiesta name continues to produce an excellent product.
Bought these for my wife to replace our old sets of dishes, the color is very nice and classic.
It will go with any decor and it's a timeless color to have!.
This was a gift for my mother-in-law for Christmas.
She already has a blue set of these and wanted to start collecting the yellow color.
She has the country living home decor style and these go well with it.
I have used it when we stay over and they are sturdy and easy to clean.
I have been collecting fiesta for a while.
It is so happy to look at and use.
I have always purchased it brand new except for the vintage pieces I have found on ebay.
I took a chance this time and ordered the 4pc.
But, who cares? I got a whole place setting for less that $20 including shipping.
I purchased this for my daughter who has a Fiesta ware collection.
She loves the shade of yellow and says it is a perfect addition to her other Fiesta sets.
It arrived quickly and was very protectively packaged.
I will purchase from them again without hesitation.
This is a fun color to add to your collection of Fiestaware.
It is a fresh lime color, is perfect for the multi color table Feisatware is known to produce.
I've been wanting a set of Fiestaware for a long time.
My mother had a set in the late 1930s, and my oldest daughter has a set.
I finally purchased when the price was reduced.
I'm happy with the quality, as well as with the way it was packaged to prevent breakage.
I'm still happy with the color and will enjoy it.
I just thought it would be more beige, like the picture, or perhaps a Winter white or soft white color.
This color is great to add to your collection.
The color will help brighten up any room! Mix and match with other fiestware items.
What I love about Fiestaware products is that they are dishwasher, oven, and microwave safe.
Beautiful color and goes with all my other fiestaware.
I would describe this as a medium denim blue and it is a welcome addition.
I used the amazon website to report that, and they shipped out another replacement set immediately, which arrived the very next day.
I used their free ups label to send back the broken set in the original box.
I'm getting rid of the all red every day plates, cups, bowls, etc.
and replacing them with all different colors of Fiesta and I love it.
I really like  the fiestaware and the colors.
But , I would not get these dishes if I had teenagers.
The are a little heavy and I can see how they can get chipped with miss use.
Safe to use in the dishwasher, oven, microwave, and freezer.
And best of all, it's available in a range of fun, complimenting colors.
We look forward to using Fiestaware in our family for many years to come!.
I currently own six of these sets in different colors.
My buffet now looks like something out of a Wes Anderson movie.
I have been using my set of 6 years, and it still looks great.
There are no chips, dents, or major scratches in any of my dishes, and they take heavy use.
When I got married my husband was unwilling to part with his old chipped dishes.
Over years of looking at different dishes, he found a reason for rejecting them all--wrong color, wrong shape, wrong material, etc.
Finally I presented him with this (in Cobalt) and we found something we could agree on!No question that this was worth waiting for.
It is very durable, with no chipping problems.
It's heavyweight and beautiful, so even without formal china (and who really uses that anymore?) we can still set a lovely table.
Plus it shares one big advantage with formal china--a huge array of matching completer pieces.
Even better, you can find it in department stores everywhere.
Also, at least on my screen, what shows as cobalt here looks NOTHING like the real color.
It is actually a very deep, glossy dark blue, which in certain light also has suggestions of purple or even black.
There are so many colors, shapes and sizes.
The Fiesta ware is very strong and doesn't scratch or chip easily.
It's Fiesta, what else can I say, its a party in a box.
I have a few pieces of the original Fiesta produced.
It is fragile and though I use it, it doesn't go anywhere near the dishwasher.
There is nothing in my view more beautiful than perfect, contemporary, cobalt blue Fiesta dinnerware!.
The familiar art deco design, rich glazes, and vibrant colors of Fiestaware evoke a simpler time.
A time when people actually cooked food instead of microwaving it.
A time of Monte Cristo sandwiches and snickerdoodles and Sunday dinners of roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and gravy.
I bought a completely new set of dishes after 16 years of using the ones I got when I was married.
The family decided we liked the white and cobalt blue so we bought half of each color.
So as long as the scratches don't bug you, then I would buy the color as it is beautiful.
This arrived on time and in good condition.
This place setting is exactly what I was looking for.
It was for a gift, and was very much appreciated.
The dishes arrived unbroken and are just beautiful.
I like to collect all of the colors.
I think it's really some of the best made and designed stuff.
This color is a really great blue color.
Not quite as dark as the photo, but I like the actual color so much more than the color in the photo.
Being Californians and loving eating out of doors we bought four place setting in this Periwinkle, the Sea Mist, Rose, Yellow and Peach.
Being vegetarians with some seafood as food choices we value sturdy dishes that are also pretty.They are dishwasher and microwave safe.
And they are thick enough that hot food stays hot and cold food stays cold.
And the curve is just right so food stays on the piece, I also like the subtle three line thread on the lip area.
I am never, ever disappointed in fiesta ware and I really loved adding this color to my collection of dishes.
I only purchase the four piece place setting when I get them.
Why you ask?  One reason really, I find them more practical than the five piece settings.
I like the larger mug in place of the cup and saucer.
Out of all the bold and attractive colors Fiesta is available in, Flamingo has to be my absolute favorite.The actual color is very nice.
These dishes replaced dishes that were 22 years old.
We looked for while to find something made in the USA that we liked! Most dishes we looked at were made in China.
Fiesta delivered the dishes ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.
They have been in use for about a month now and several cycles through the dishwasher and numerous meals.
No scratches from use and still a pleasure to see on the table.
I'm sure that our economy alone could use the help and stop our continued delay in our economic recovery.
Over time, I've come to appreciate simpler, less busy-looking dishes.
I like letting the food be the art instead of the plate-pattern.
My parents have had the yellow Fiestaware for at least 10 years.
The yellow was discontinued in 2002, but the sunflower is close--a bit deeper and brighter while the yellow is more pastel.
They are solid, sturdy, not prone to chipping or cracking, and I've been told they're forgiving when dropped.
My parents' dishes still look as good as new.
I've never noticed any knife scratches on the plates.
Gave as a gift to a college student, it was perfect because she doesn't need multi-person place settings but is nicer than plastic sets.
Would buy for myself as well when I need new dinnerware!.
I have been a fan of Fiestaware for many years, but I have recently added Persimmon to my collection.
The color is great with my Southwestern decor and the quality is superior to any other dinnerware that I have found.
This is very family friendly!  The 4 piece place setting is my favorite because I like the size of the mugs and the salad plate.
My daughter is collecting fiesta dishes and these were a nice addition to the ones she already had.
Love the design and the quality of the materials in this Fiesta dinnerware.
For my money, though, &#34;flamingo&#34; is the least attractive color I've seen so far.
The &#34;peacock&#34; blue is absolutely stunning, and the red and tangerine are nice.
I was pleasantly surprised at how durable, cheerful and fun these are.
I don't think I be bringing out the `good china' too often anymore!.
It was first brought to the market in 1936, then taken off and returned in the 1980's.
it is now a collectible and sold worldwide.My daughter was tired of her all white dinnerware, and requested Fiestaware.
The four pieces are well made and will be long lasting.
This Fiesta set is one of thirty colors now available.
There are three colors that are special editions, Chartreuse, Juniper and Sapphire.
And recently a square line of Fiestaware was introduced.This set was warmly received,,and many happy meals will be spent surrounding this color.
Place setting consists of: dinner plate; salad plate; bowl; mug.
And Fiestaware is packed so well you don't have to worry about breakage.
It goes from the microwave to the table to the dishwasher without a problem.
They're solid everyday dishes that newlyweds won't have any issues with.
Ah, this is so pretty and vibrant; great color and fabulous addition to my Fiesta set.
It arrived well padded and safe with no breakage.
This was purchased as a gift for my niece - she loves Fiesta.
You can freeze in it, take it from the freezer and put it in the oven.
It is also great in the microwave - just be careful as it does get hot.
I loved this dinnerware when I began to use it and I love it still.
The wife loved this color and had to have it.
We order a set every month until we have them all.
We're on set 8 now and haven't found anything negative to report yet.
Microwave safe, goes well in the oven and dishwasher too.
My 16 year oled son does the dishes and haven't lost a single on yet.
I got the Sunflower and plan to use it as a plater.
I already have a larger chop plate that I use on Thanksgiving for the Turkey, this one I can use for the Ham.
Thank you Amazon for providing Fiesta dishes at a reasonable rate.
Purchased several Fiesta Chop plates for all sorts of uses.
I will be using this plate as a serving tray.
Such a great color to add to my collection.
Mostly, I bought this because I have a lot of Fiesta but didn't have a chop plate.
We use it as a small serving platter.
We don't use it for pizza, though, since I have the12-Inchand 15-Inch pizza trays.
However, I could see using it as an over-sized buffet plate if no other dishes (bread & butter plate, salad bowl, etc) are being used.
Most pieces come in white or ivory, for those who don't like the colors.
It's very sturdy, DW & MW safe, and a good value.
Love the color selection and great price on Amazon.
I have a set for 12 now and all in all am pleased.
The chop plate is a nice size for serving.
It's sizeable and pretty with a rich scarlet color.
Used this recently for my son's 30th year ice-cream cake!  Made a lively presentation.
(And no he doesn't live with his parents!)  lol  Love this fiestaware!.
Have purchased as many of these Fiesta bowls as I can.
They are great for all manner of uses and the colors are amazing.
It is still a nice size for the price and we decided to keep it but be aware it holds 11-12 ounces by my measuring.
The items were packaged very well and I love fiesta ware.
Colors bright and I mix and match all my fiesta for a colorful table.
I love the color, style, size and quality!!!!.
Purchase 5 of these at the same time.
So basically, what I received were 4 bowls that matched and 1 that quite didn't.
This wasn't a problem for me though, and I don't consider it a defective piece.
I like defects of this type in Fiesta ware since I look upon Fiesta as being somewhat like an  'Industrial Revolution cottage industry' enterprise.
Love fiesta ware, only dishes I use out of 4 sets I  own.
We love cold cereal & hot oatmeal and we like BIG bowls of it,  so that's not what we bought these fairly small bowls for.
Also very appealing (all those colors) filled with any hot or cold nibbles or finger-foods & scattered around the dining or living room.
We find this a really handy time saver : just reach for the bowl color when it's time for the ingredient.
And there certainly are plenty of different colors available!.
I am also a fool for my feline babies.
And its solid weight does not easily slide across the floor.I recommend this bowl over any pet dish made in Asia.
I use it for a variety of things, from scrambling eggs for breakfast to eating soup, cereal, snacks, and ice cream.
I reheat soup in the microwave in it too.
I have never eaten soup from a prettier bowl than this.
One of my favorite individual pieces from Fiesta.
I have a set of six of these bowls in scarlet.They certainly add drama and festivity to the table.
I use them for salads and the bright red color really compliments the colors of the vegetables in the salad.
They are very durable and easy to care for.Made in The USA, I highly recommend these bowls for casual and even formal use.
The scarlet color really adds a very fun and elegant touch to your table.
I have a set of mixing that were my late mother's, which she got in 1940.
We purchased this size bowl to use for our infant and toddler, perfect size.
I really dislike using plastic and fiesta ware has proven to be extremely durable for our family.
Also great for ice cream or a bowl of granola.
We've been using FiestaWare plates & bowls for several years.
I tried to find the bowls we have and it would appear that the shape/style has changed.
We have three of this shape (two in lapis, one in shamrock) and I think I like it better than the old shape.
We chose FiestaWare because it really has stood up for some rough treatment by the kids and because it's made in the USA.
This bowl is perfect for small servings of treats such as fruit, pudding or ice cream.
They do well in the dishwasher, but be careful when eating out of them, the lighter colors scratch easily.
I bought this bowl to use outdoors to put water in for the squirrels that visit our yard.
I wanted something that was solid and stable - that wouldn't be easy for a squirrel to knock over or push around.
It rests on top of our fence which has about a 4 inch ledge.
It holds a good amount of liquid and isn't easy to tip over.
I know you're probably not reading this because you're looking for a water bowl for squirrels but they love it.
i discovered this size fiesta bowl last Christmas and wanted a new color.
Perfect size bowl, smaller than what comes with the sets, nice color, great price.
I bought some of these in place settings, and I love the color, so this is one I will be adding to the collection.
Fiesta Dinner Plates are a nice size and come in beautiful colors.
The lapiz is a beautiful shade of blue.
They are of very high quality and very durable.
I bought for everyday use most items of the Santa Fe Collection  by Pacific Rim Imports wich went out of production.
When we have guests, they love that colorful pile of plates  displayed on the buffet.
And quality is writen everywhere in these plates.
It is a little heavier than some plates but not that much.
There are so many colors to choose from and they all match together.
They even match perfectly with my Temp-tations from Tara.
My husband really likes them too; reminds him of the good memories of vacationing on the peninsula.
The house on the lake was stocked with the same plates.
This is a great real dinnerware and is microwavable.
Solid made plate and of course made in the USA!  Great price.
price was a bit high but worth every penny! Was happy also that their made in the USA.
these Fiesta items are hands down the best we have owned in fifteen years of marriage.
loved them so much we plan on buying them all.
Amazon does a great job shipping them also!.
I have toooo many plates, but I could not pass this up.
They are a nice weight, and they are microwave and dishwasher safe.
Love this plate It is practical and works well.
We bought a motor home and needed to put kitchen items in it.
I went on Amazon bought all of the items I knew we would need.
Wow super easy and everything is of so wonderful.
This plate was exactly as it was decribed and is part of the Fiesta set I already had purchased.
It was delivered quickly and was exactly as described.
All of my dishes are the same brand and style, but in different colors.
Just love looking at them in the cabinet and on the table.
What more can I say about fiestaware! they're amazing! I love the color and they super durable.
I personally have two in every color; and they're great for parties.
I get compliments on them all the time!.
You and your family can feel safe eating off these.
Word to the wise - If the dishes don't state that they're lead and cadmium free, DON'T BUY THEM.
I have and old french country kitchen with glass doors.
The color pops out adding joy and whimsy to my kitchen.
I have purchased 12 of these plates and am very happy with all of them.
They are a good size for dinner plates and I love to mix n match the colors.
Careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates.
The plates themselves are wonderful- I own a lot of Fiesta.
IT's made in the US, and its glazes are lead free and safe.
What more could you want?  Don't gamble with your health using cheap Chinese made plates.
Cutting on them hasn't left scratches, nor has using a dishwasher caused problems.
So I ordered 6 dinner plates and 6 salad plates.
I got that package with 1 of each plate broken.
So I ordered 3 more of each, 1 to replace the broken piece and 2 to bring the total to 8 of each dish.
That package came and as soon as I picked it up I heard broken pieces inside.
The box was too large for the items and they were just loose in there.
This is a big mistake on Amazon's part.
Regarding the product - I just re-vamped my dish situation after many years of putting up with mismatched old sets from my youth.
I decided to open up one of my cabinets and put some colorful dishes in it to add more color to my house.
I decided on Fiesta, which I have always liked.
I got tangerine, shamrock, turquoise, sunflower and peacock items and I could not be happier with the result.
Now my kitchen - and open great-room - are punched up with these vibrant colors.The shamrock is stunning against cherry cabinets.
The turquoise is prettier and more vibrant than appears online.
I see more pieces coming in my future!.
I love my Fiesta dishes and have wanted to add a few more dinner plates over the years.
An emery board works in a pinch :).
The colors are great and dishes are durable.
I am just starting into collecting Fiesta dinnerware and am very pleased with them.
They are beautiful and durable and I love the option to buy individual pieces of my choosing which is very important on a budget.
I am mixing my colors so I'll have varied sets that compliment each other.
The Paprika glaze is beautiful and we find that food just looks better on these plates.
Very sturdy plate and I've already knocked it up against other dishes and so far not a single chip.
Safe in the microwave, freezer, oven, dishwasher and Made in America...can't beat that.
I love the colors fiestaware comes out with.
I had collected it in the 80s,,and now with the new colors.
I bought these to add to my set of fiesta ware, I have lots, this is wonderful and sturdy and is a daily use item.
No fear of there being fragile dishes, Fiesta ware has been my choice for a long time.
I like the weight and I like the durability.
I can not begin to explain how much Fiesta china gladdens my heart.
Every time I open the kitchen cabinet I am just so in love with it.
Amazon is one of the best places to purchase it and I have never gotten a bad box of it from them.
Sometimes they will have a sale where you pay for 3 place settings and get 4.
How awesome is that? I have 2 Gusto bowls enroute right now.
I wanted to see how much they hold and will buy more if I like them.
Sometimes I don't like the way a particular food looks on a particular color, scrambled eggs on red really repulses me.
a very good bright color and very easy to wash either by hand or machine.
I have collected Fiestaware dishes for almost five years now.
I like Fiesta because the lines and the design of the plates are so classic.
These dishes are very heavy compared to most other stoneware, and they are not prone to brakeage in normal every day use.
Fiestaware also compliments their dishes with all sorts of serving pieces, flatware, glasses, napkin holders, and so much more.
Or pick fresh lemons and place them in the bowl and they look gorgeous.
I guess that is one thing I find so lovely about the bowl.
It is unique and definately not ugly as some reviewers have stated.
Goes well with the rest of my Fiestaware.
this bowl will easily hold 4 pounds of grapes and a multitude of other fruits, pears,apples.
it also functions well as a serving bowl for pasta and mashed potatoes.
A wonderful bowl to use as a table centerpiece.
The pedestal bottom is subtle and still allows for stacking when storing.
As far as serving, the bowl is about medium sized.
Works well as a roll or biscuit holder, salad mix for side salads or side dishes.
It is not quite big enough for main dishes for more than 2 people.
It is a must have bowl for your Fiestaware collection.I read so many reviews from people who received broken dishes when ordering Fiestaware from Amazon.
This is my favorite bowl in my Fiestaware collection.
I have one in Scarlet Red and one in Black.
Very attractive on the table or just on the counter with fruit.
I have had many compliments on his bowl.
It's hard to find pieces in the colors you want in the store.
Happy toe be able to order on line.
I have this bowl in peacock (bright blue).
The style and color go with my other fiestaware and the pedestal is just the right size.
I noticed some people thought the bowl was too small so I was planning on using it as a fruit or candy dish.
For me, this bowl is the perfect size for salad, a small pasta dish or vegetables.
Wether or not you collect Fiestaware, the Pedestal Bowl is an excellent serveware addition.
Just the right size to hold two bunches of grapes, or your favorite side dish.
It also makes an extreemly wonderful single serving salad bowl  for those of us who can't get enough of those tasty greens.
There isn't a lot of ovenware that can go right to the table and be pretty.
The bowl also works well for fruit, popcorn, soup.
So, I now own 2 of these covered casserole dishes in bright beautiful fiesta colors - shamrock and sunflower.
These feel more fragile than all of my other fiesta, but seem to hold up just as well.
I serve our family of 6 in them.
You can bake in them, but so far I have only used this dish as serveware.
The lids do not fit tight, but do a nice job of covering the food inside to keep it warm longer.
I store them in my cabinet with the lid upside down to help protect the knob on top.
Periwinkle and Yellow are the colours of this server that we have.
Hold between 6-8 cups of salad and pasta etc.
And the subtle rim on the base makes it a sturdy no tip over items.
Easy to lift and hand off to the person next to you because the sides are sloped just right to prevent you from dropping it.
The price is more than twice as much as the 2 quart bowl.
It is cute and I use it, but I would not purchase it again for the price I paid, which was $50 here on Amazon.
At the moment, the cobalt and tangerine ones are $13 less than what I paid, that price seems more reasonable.
My lid wobbles pretty badly which I find irritating.
Other than the price and wobbly lid, it is a nice piece and I get a good amount of use out of it.
It seems hard to find casserole dishes/bowls with lids on them nowadays so I do appreciate this one.
It came in perfect! I recommend the fiestaware line to anybody! Everything is beautiful!! Thank you very much I am very Happy!.
Boy, do I LOVE this piece! I got mine for a LOT less at an outlet store and it's just wonderful.
I LOVE the purple color - it's just gorgeous in a tuscan kitchen and this piece looks marvelous on the table.
It does wonderfully in the oven - it's not overly big so don't get it to feed a family of 5 or so.
I get tons of compliments on these pieces and the purple, well, it's just original and if you're afraid of it, don't be.
It's just a gorgeous color and one that I'm very glad to have introduced into my kitchen.
I have had some bad experiences buying serving dishes on Amazon.
The lid fits perfectly and the bowl is perfectly round.
It is shaped to make it really easy to clean and it is thick enough that it holds the temperature of broccoli very well.
The color is a nice splash on the table.
I've been yearning for this particular piece in lemongrass to add to my Fiestaware collection.
So, I was thrilled to receive it as a birthday gift!  Lucky me!The covered casserole is just as beautiful as it is functional.
great for keeping hot dishes hot and cold dishes cold.
Easily fits in the refrigerator and the microwave as well as the oven and it looks great on the table.
Received the Fiesta peacock casserole yesterday and microwaved a bag of frozen chicken/pasta/vegetables for our evening meal.
Worked like a charm and just the right size for the dinner.
The price of this fiesta casserole had me pause before I purchased it.
It makes the creamiest rice pudding you could ever make.
I love it for keeping noodles hot, casseroles hot and it is easy to transport from kitchen to dining room.
Looks great on the table and I use it every day.
I have been cooking for over 40 years and this is the best covered casserole I have ever owned or used.
Used for keeping Kool-Aid packets instead of recipes.
Buy this, recipe cards and clear recipe card protectors as gifts for showers.
Have also purchased them for my grandchildren and add the recipes that we make together.
The box also serves as a holder for the recipes when cooking.
I do buy different dividers because these are small and short.
This recipe box is attractive enough to be left on a countertop while, at the same time, fitting in with any decor and being discreet.
It proved to be an ideal, much appreciated, present for my modern minimalist daughter-in-law.
I bought it to update my loose recipes.
I like having a clear view recipe box.
The category cards are best combined with the  Weatherbee Tabbed Recipe Card Dividers, Set of 24.
My wife wanted this to make a recipe box for our daughter.
This clear, acrylic recipe box looks very nice in my remodeled kitchen.
Useful and attractive and I've had compliments on it from others.
Love the nice clean look and slot at the top to hold recipe card to keep it clean.Box is too deep for cards.
Cards sit too far down in the box.
Still difficult to get out the one you want when the box is full.
I ordered several of these to put in my china cabinet.
My doll collection can now be tiered so that I can see them all.
The clear acrylic makes them almost invisible, and the height of each step is perfect for this purpose.
Most of my dolls are 8 inches tall.
The steps are deep enough for the doll stands, too.
I researched several options for shelving to use to display small items on a bookcase shelf.
They are remarkably sturdy for having no middle support, and can take a good amount of weight.
My only complaint is this:  These are clear acrylic items.
Obviously if you're ordering such an item, you want a flawless clear item.
If it had been delivered to me with scratches or flaws, I'd have returned it.
I bought a whole bunch of these to put in a hutch to display my vinyl toy collection.
they're clear and clean and I love them!  the shelves are the perfect size for the 3 inch tall figurines.
I use my acrylic organizer on a countertop filled with 36 labeled spice jars in three rows of 12.
It looks absolutely wonderful and keeps everything organized and within easy view.
I'm thinking about buying a second unit for the pantry because the shelves are actually deep enough to hold cans! Highly recommend.
I got two of these to use as display stands for a convention I recently vendored at.
They were very useful in making sure my merchandise was displayed to the best of it's potential.
Now, I am using one of these in my cabinets to help with organization.
So, they are practical in all sense of the word, and very sturdy too.
There isn't much to say about this product.
It really is exactly as depicted and exactly as expected.
Sugar packets are so neat and easy and this is so cute.
We have a really modern kitchen and this goes perfectly.
It also lends itself to a retro look.
This matched all my other tea/silverwear/napkin holders so I picked it up.
It, of course is quite light and well built and holds maybe 20 packets, perfect for an evening with company.
It just looks so much nicer than sweeteners sitting in a bowl.
This is a very nice sweetener holder, much nicer-looking than the ordinary square ones.
It appears to be good quality, the edges are not sharp, everything seems to be done well.
The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I think it's a little bit over-priced.
This is a simple product that does just what you expect - holds packets of sugar.
I bought this to match the napkins holders and this is really nice.
Can be used every day or for nice dinner parties.
I've had this several months now and use it daily.
would match any decor, so it always looks nice on my table!.
Pretty well made, solving my purpose very well.
Not cheap material so definately worth buying if you looking for something for sugar packets to serve along with coffee/tea.
You can put sweetner packets in it, and then pull them out as you need them!.
This cute little acrylic container is, of course, just the right size for all you artificial sweeteners as well as truvia, a natural sweetener.
It looks nice on the counter, goes with everything.
I have mine in a wicker basket with my medications next to the coffee pot.
That's handy for organization as well as cleaning.
I was looking for a simple solution to keep my sweet n low in on the counter and this baby does the trick.
Not much to say, it's pretty simple but exactly what I was looking for.
Way to go, great product, price and seller, I recommend them!.
The &#34;Acrylic Beehive Honey Jar with Server&#34; looks great and can go with anything.
It really looks like crystal and I hope it stays that way.
This beehive jar is perfect is style and amount of product that it holds.
It washes up nicely and always remains on my table and looks inviting.
Wow, who knew there were so many honey jars out there.
Next eye opener was that most do not list country of origin, a dead giveaway as to where they are from.
Did find some that were made here in the USA with no lead used in making them, but could not find one I liked.
So I bought this US acrylic jar, and love it.
Is just the right size for one or two, but would require  frequent filling for a larger family.
Just receive this honey server and it is the right size and very beautiful.
I have been looking for a honey server for a long time with no luck until now.
I am very happy with the purchase and the shipping from the seller is very fast and efficient.
I definitely plan on keeping this grinder for many years.
This is a good, smooth, and very fast pepper mill, that sits next to my oven and is apparently very durable.
on a roast.I fill it with Tellicherries bought in bulk from the SF Herb Company here in San Francisco.I give this my recommendation (i.e.
That way, it doesn't rub your skin; it moves with your skin.
I'm going back through all of my Amazon purchases beginning in 2001 and writing reviews for the notable products I've purchased over the years.
I would definitely buy it again and highly recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it.
This pepper mill with a lever turn works way better than the kind where you twist the knob.
You get a lot more ground pepper with this one with a lot less effort.
There are three settings, for fine, coarse and cracked, and they are easy to set.
It is smaller than the one it replaced, but I've got used to it and like it very much.
My thanks to Cooks Illustrated for praising William Bounds mills.
It is actually possible to select fine, medium, or coarse grind and get it.
As it comes with a mix of quality peppers, I haven't checked the ease of fill.
This works the way it should, and looks good, too.
I only have one thing to say about this product, it needs to be taller.
If you have big hands like I do, then this mill isn't for you.
It does a good job for making different sized ground pepper grains though.
I bought this because I hate the regular twist action pepper mills.
This one is easier for me to use and looks nice in my kitchen.
I bought the salt mill so I could have a matching set.
I have two of these that I use consistently.
I keep one filled with black pepper, the other with a blend.
They are easy to use, excellent adjustment mechanism, goes from very course to very fine, and easy to refill.
I keep mine in the kitchen but would have no problem putting these out on the table as well.
I tried several other grinders previously and these are the ones I choose to keep.
This pepper mill is a little on the small size, but that's what I wanted.
It has a dial just below the crank for the size of the grind, very handy.Is perfect for my small kitchen.
The handle provides plenty of leverage for grinding the peppercorns with a minimum of physical effort.
It's sturdy and can be used for either salt or pepper.
My husband loves to cook and was very happy to get this.
OK; so my lifelong inventory of pepper containers has been somewhat limited, I&#8217;ll admit.
From the beginning where I used the rectangular tin container at the table, I eventually &#8216;upgraded&#8217; to a pepper shaker.
I should use a pepper mill since there is a culinary advantage to having the freshly ground peppercorns used.
I quickly saw the light and purchased a mill some 25 years ago.
That was a William Bounds &#8220;Key Mill&#8221; in walnut.
At the time the price seemed rather steep since I was replacing a glass container with a screw top.
The salt and sugar shaker were glass and translucent which displayed the color and quantity of the contents, which removed any guesswork regarding refills.
The extended handle facilitates easier grinding with the extra leverage from the arm, and therefore delivers a greater quantity of ground pepper with less effort.
Keep in mind that many &#8216;blended&#8217; peppers include allspice, which is not technically a peppercorn and much larger in diameter.
The clear body makes it easy to identify quantity while acting as a showcase for your finest Tellicherry, Sarawak or Lampong peppercorns.
Has some nice weight to it, which a man can appreciate.
It allows one to grind greater amounts, and I love fresh ground black pepper, so I'm not a &#34;two grinds and done&#34; kind of guy.
The different options (fine to coarse) for grind are nice.
The handle looks a little cheaply made, but it isn't a problem (it's pretty durable).
Conclusion: this is a good small-size pepper grinder.
This pepper mill is very easy to use and produces high volume quickly.
The only downside (thus 4 stars) is the top assembly is made of plastic and doesn't feel very durable.
Time will tell! Very pleased for the time being.
It's light, small and easy to use.I was surprised that it wasn't glass; it's plastic.
But, afterdropping it on the floor a couple times, it is very sturdy!I'm considering purchasing the salt mill by this same company.
I ordered this as a replacement for the one I had that broke.
Only difference I noticed is that the bottom is now plastic where it used to be metal.
I read reviews on other highly rated pepper mills and almost went for the Atlas as people seemed to really like it.
The Williams Bounds adjust easily with a twist of the top and goes from almost cracked to very fine.
It just never seemed to work right after that and eventually the bottom plate started slipping when I would twist the crank.
It could have been coincidence but I think the two things are probably related.
We've been using this unit for 1 year now.
It works well, and the adjustable grind setting is nice.
It feels solid and has a good look.
Once again, a real winner of a grinder.
I put variegated color pepper in mine to get a different pepper flavor that I like.
It's perfect to be able to set the top to whatever coarseness or fineness I prefer for a given food being eaten.
It has a clear plastic bowl and a grinder shaft retainer to keep the shaft centered when filling.
the only thing how to keep the shaft nut from coming loose when grinding?.
I didn't give five stars because the knob to adjust the grind on top loosens every now and then-no biggie-just tighten it up again.
This doesn't happy often so I'm still very happy with my super cute pepper mill.
That being said, another reviewer mentioned some jerkiness while using this grinder and that is definitely true.
We don't really have a problem with it, but if you have a glass shelf or are really worried about stuff like that, be advised.
The grind setting (coarse/medium/fine) was a bit confusing at first but I got it eventually.
The entire silver top part turns for that.
Those are my criteria for kitchen tools, and this is one of my favorites at the moment.
I have high hopes it will last as long as my last William Bounds pepper mill.
Even if it last half as long I will be thrilled.
It really is so helpful when I am cooking.
I also love the fine, course, medium setting.
I did not have any problem with the knob on the top becoming loose.
I also love the crushing mechanism rather than the conventional grinding that comes with others.
I wish it was cheaper so that I could get a salt one as well.
What else can I say?  It's a high quality egg slicer.
Haven't tried anything else yet, but I have faith that it will give me lots of great use for many years.
Seems to be a quality product....better than most egg slicers you find in the big box stores.
I've only had it for a few weeks and used it 2 or 3 times...so it's hard to rave about it at this point.
So far so good and I have no complaints.
I'm writing this review after owning this egg slicer for the last seven years.It still looks and works just like new.
There is no tarnish or rust, the hinges still work perfectly, the wires still cut cleanly.
At least twice a week I'm slicing eggs or mushrooms with this slicer.
If this one ever breaks, I'll definitely buy another.
I bought this 7 years ago, from Amazon.
Slices eggs, mushrooms, strawberries, even mozzarella cheese balls.
I came back to get one for a family member, and it seems they are no longer carried.
This slicer is by far the best one I've ever owned.
Very good slicer...however, not 100% stainless steel...it is also chrome plated.
All the other egg slicers I have used PALE in comparison to this one!This is a JOY to use and easy to clean.
If you had told me that I would spend $13 for an egg slicer, I would have told you that I would be committed first.
Well, I've broken two slicers, and bought another one for $2.50 and was displeased with it.
I carefully read all the reviews of this one and decided to go for it.
This one is so well made that it will probably outlive me.
I especially like the fact that it slices eggs in either direction, and of course, that it goes in the dishwasher.
Supposedly it will slice mushrooms and kiwi, so I'm going to try it out.
This model is fairly heavy, and the wires are substantial.
The wires are starting to be somewhat crooked, resulting in crooked slices, but none of the wires have broken yet.
It goes in the dishwasher at least once a week on the top shelf only, with nothing around it...what more does it want?.
If you want a reliable slicer that will last for years, this is the slicer to own or give as a gift.
Wash after wash, the dishwasher has not tarnished its finish.
The wires haven't stretched like with cheaper slicers, but I admit I never use it for mushrooms, cheese, etc.
so I don't know how it would stand up to firmer foods.
I previously had several cheap plastic slicers, and the cutting wires would always break.
After the last one broke, I decided to pay more and get a quality slicer.
It is heavy duty, and has never failed me yet.
I have had mine for about a year now.
But I can tell you that it is surprisingly heavy for its size and definitely gets the egg-slicing job done.
I picked this up several years ago in the KitchenEtc store and absolutely love it.
It's an all steel egg-slicer (not a cross-cut slicer).
It's great for cutting mushrooms and strawberries as well.I usually use it to slice the eggs in all three dimensions for my salads.
It has kept its beautiful shine all these four years later.
If you're going to hand wash it, just make sure you get in those little crevices under the slicer.
Don't waste your money on the cheaper ones.
I bought a cheapie version of this, and soon the metal discolored and seemed like it didn't get clean, and the wires weren't as strong.
I bought this unit to use as an ACTUAL OVEN as well as a toaster.
This means that I have used it to make breads, cakes, bagels, cookies entrees, you name it -- as well as toast and Pop-Tarts.
In all these many uses it has never disappointed.
In addition, it makes extremely good toast, which is pretty rare for a toaster oven.
There's a reason it costs so much: it is a really superior, high-quality product.
I paid more than Amazon.com's current price (because it was a new model), and I don't regret it a bit.
I purchased this product a month ago and I have been happily baking ever since it arrived.
I bought this one primarily for the baking/roasting/broiling ability.
It's large enough to roast a full chicken or two Cornish game hens, browning their skins beautifully.
A 2.5 lb eye round roast was crisp on the outside, tender and juicy inside.
If you're single, or a couple, this is the oven for you.
I love it!!  It does just what I wanted, and more.
I find I use it more than my regular oven now.
Takes much less time to heat up, which means using less electricity.
Great product that does all it says and fast.
Oven large enough and racks flexible in positioning to allow ample size baking pans/glass or stoneware.
I did find it cheaper in Costco than on-line, so shop around.
I am very pleased with this toaster oven.
I am EXTREMELY pleased with how fast it heats up, which appeals to my energy conservation side as well as its convenience.
The results are very good as far as how it does the various tasks, and I use it several times a day.
I researched this one carefully and definitely feel I bought the right product for my needs.
I just purchased this toaster/convection oven after looking at Amazon and Consumer Reports reviews.
Since I live in Arizona, I wanted something to use in hot weather that wouldn't heat up our house so much.
So far, I have toasted English muffins, reheated rolls, and cooked fish sticks in the convection oven.
I hope to use it more as the temp gets hotter!.
I've used all the features and have no complaints.
and it just works superbly.I was very impressed by how well this oven works and would buy it again.
It has a clock on it and I set it as well with no problems.
This oven has replaced my larger oven for much of my cooking.
I have even used it for pork raosts.
It does not heat up the kitchen the way a larger over would.
I just bought a second to replace my original.One diadvantage - It gets very hot.
You must take care not to touch it when baking or broiling.
Because of the heat, the white cover discolors and eventually cracks.
We liked ours so much, we were willing to live with that.
We replaced it with a second white version after two years.
I have a toaster oven graveyard out in my dumpster.
I based my purchase decision on my experience with other Cuisinart products and extensive reading of reviews from many sources.
It turns out this is even bigger than what I had before--both wide and tall.
I can fit Corningware pans with the domed lids and knobs on top.
It produced an excellent roast chicken, and I probably will use it more and more to make &quot;weekend&quot; dishes during the week.
The additional cost for the convection over the regular was small, so it's definitely worth it even for occasional use.The oven itself functions admirably.
I love that it beeps when it's fully preheated, and the heat sensor really does keep it constantly and evenly heated to the correct temperature.
The only thing I'm not crazy about is setting the timer--one press for every minute, one for every hour.
Gets to be a pain when you're setting 45 minutes.
But, that is balanced out by the fact that the timer alarm keeps beeping until you come turn it off.
And honestly, it's really only an aesthetic problem.
Upon first inspection out of the box I was pleased with its apparent quality.
But on the very first use it warped, and now buckles significantly on every use.
Further, after the first washing I took it out of the drying rack only to discover rust along the bottom edge where water had pooled.
I didn't even think it could rust, let alone do it on its first contact with water.
The rack--at least in one of its positions--actually wraps around the front corners of the pan.
This means in order to take the pan out of the oven you have to lift it 1/2&quot; vertically over the rack.
Lift it and whatever's on it, plus whatever hot grease has accumulated, with nothing to grab it by.
The other option is to take the rack out with it, which means tilting everything 30 degrees to get it past the stops.
UPDATE:One (of the 2) bottom elements in this oven died after 12 years.
When the Black & Decker breaks I will replace it with another Cuisinart.
I have learned that some things are worth the cost.ORIGINAL REVIEW:We have had this oven for over 5 years now.
I've owned at least 10 different toaster ovens over the years.
I've had my Cuisinart for about 2 years now.
It is by far the best one I've ever owned.
It hasn't discolored, it still works just fine.
Toaster ovens aren't meant for baking!This oven works quickly and evenly for roasting chicken and making baked potatoes.
It's so-so (like all toaster ovens) for toast.
The rewarm button is handy as well.For my money, this toaster oven has the most features and is the most consistent.
It's not been a problem to clean, either.But geez, make your wedding cake in a real oven.
The nature of a toaster oven is that with such a small cavity, it's going to overbrown anything you attempt to bake.
I've never owned a toaster oven, no matter how big, that baked well.
I have used my Cuisinart toaster oven with convection for more than two months.
It does everything perfectly and takes up much less space on my countertop than the Black & Decker unit it replaced.
It is attractive and the touch pad buttons are easy to use and understand.
We love this thing!  Loaded with features, digital displays, handy controls and the convection oven feature is FAST.
The glass door lets you clearly see whats going on inside - no interior light needed.
Great energy saver when you just need to heat something up but can't or don't want to use the microwave or full oven.
Makes great toast, bagels, frozen waffles, or to bake some muffins.
Very easy to clean with its removable tray.
Capacity seems to be sufficient enough for its intended use - we use it numerous times every day.
Quality construction - we have had it over a year and its still runs fine.
This was a great value for the money, plus we got a spiffy free 8" Cusinart no-stick skillet and free shipping.
This convection/oven combination is a nice size to stay on your counter.
I just received it for Christmas and used it one time to bake some rolls.
Has a lot of combinations of buttons which takes a bit of time to learn.
It does seem to get a bit hot so have it placed on a plastic cutting board sized to fit.
I have been using this oven for a few years now.
It works great and has never given me a problem.
It heats up quick and cooks evenly and quickly.
The only trouble is that it is hard to clean.
As long as you dont mind an oven that has that lived in look it is a great buy.
It rules all over a toaster oven.Always go with the solid state digital controls if posible.
This one has them.The temp is 'right on' according to the Taylor oven thermometer.
Of course a good shot of oven cleaner brings it back (but at what cost?).This is a bear to clean.
'Gunk' gets under the door edge and there is no provision to remove the door and clean it.
It was only $79 so maybe it won't work worth a darn.
However, if it does work, I will faithfully report how much better it does than the Cuisinart.
It toasts 2 large bagels easily, and I have also roasted chicken pieces and broiled a few small steaks.
It has many sought-after features, including convection baking.
Get a flashlight! Ray-O-Vac sells them for about $4.99.
After over 4 1/2 years, this toaster oven is still working absolutely flawlessly.
It is used on a daily basis, and I still don't have a single complaint about it.
I often use it in place of my full-sized oven.
I love toast and make a lot of sandwiches of all with premium breads of all thick nesses and sizes as densities.
My wife likes heavy multigrain breads full of moisture which take forever to toast.
I like the light fluffy bread which toasts much quicker.
This toaster oven consistently performs well over this variety of toasts.
We like seeds on the bread exterior to toast enough to release their flavor & this machine does that well too.
I read about 200+ reviews of the leading toasters from many sources.
This toaster received some of the best reviews including, but not often mentioned comments on toasting.
I needed a nice looking toaster for the new upgraded house.
It installed flawlessly & was toasting in 'extradinore' mode without reading any instructions.
Cuisinart TOB-165 gives you a lot of intuitive control over toasting and the results are impressive.
It heats very quickly and just toasts the outside, nothing more.
You have to watch that one like a hawk or it will burn.
I much prefer the results from the Cuisinart TOB-165 & use it when I want the best results.
My large electric oven is terribly unreliable temperature wise.
I did all the shopping around, all the price comparisons and reviews.
I've had my Cuisinart food processor for about 25 years and it's still great so I thought going with the Cuisinart couldn't be a mistake.
It's surprising what can fit in this small oven.
I've made breads, cakes, cookies, a chicken, Indian pudding, Irish soda bread and more.
I got some unglazed quarry tiles at Lowe's for 77 cents each and put them on the rack.
You can make a single size pizza right on them and I leave them in all the time.
for a commercial pizza stone?  The oven heats in about 2 min.
I use the convection oven when I'm starving and can't wait the extra time of normal cooking.
No regrets to this purchase and if it lasts half the time of the food processor, I'll be a very happy girl.
Perfect Perfect! Great feature, easy to use, even for older people.
The buttons are clearly marked, not confusing, so many features from over, broiler, to convection.
A complete toaster oven and the quality is the best.
Cuisinart products are built extremely well, durable, and last.
I'm a big fan of doing a lot of cooking in my toaster oven, since I am single and generally cook just for myself.
I had an old, large toaster oven and had not been able to find a good replacement for it although I've been looking for years.
Hard to pass up with free shipping ...as well!First, it's nice and roomy inside.
I think it's as big as my old one, it just doesn't look it from the outside.
Looks great on the counter, very modern and built well.
Clearly it stands the test of time and should give you many years of use.
Is there any value in spending this much on a Toaster Oven?  Thity years ago, the originals by GE cost less than thirty bucks!  Well.
It has as compelte a set of features as I can imagine, including very good electronic controls.
It toast nicely and very controllably, and it has lots of capacity.
And depsite all the features it's easy to use.
Just love this !! Perfect for reheating, baking etc.
It has 3 settings- bake,convection bake and broil.
The convection bake browns fast, really makes great french fries, frozen breaded fish, shrimp etc.
really crispy and no added oil, do not use my deepfryer much any more.
It browns very fast and you have to keep an eye on things or they will burn.
Easy clean-up and the Amazon price is great.
Saves a lot of money, my Viking Range eats natural gas so this is very economical for small items.
And when we have company it comes in handy for extra things that need to be baked.
Overall, a really good value for the money.
I just love this toaster oven; it has a clean, smooth sleek design.
The digital controls allow you to set the temperature and it beeps when it is preheated.
The defrost feature really works!  All you do is press one more button and your frozen bagel or waffle will toast perfectly.
It also has a very easy to set timer for baking or broiling.
The removable crumb tray, rack and broiler/drip pans are a breeze to clean.
I still love this toaster oven, we use it all the time and it still works perfectly and looks like new.
It even went through a kitchen remodel serving as our only baker=roaster=toaster=oven.
We previously had a Delonghi Alfredo which lasted 15 years, so we were inclined to get another Delonghi.
But we felt their quality and features were not up to the level of this Cuisinart TOB-165.
Boy are we ever happy we decided to go with this one.
I don't know why but food tastes much better when cooked in this oven!  Perhaps it's because of the "exact temp" feature.
And the convection feature makes the best baked potatos.
This is the only toaster oven I've gotten that has a door that shuts tight.
I read the reviews and decided to go for it.
More money than I wanted to spend, but I have had 3 different toaster ovens in as many years.
This oven is a dream for toasting, and roasts very well.
The biggest drawback is there is no interior light.
After much research online and in-store, I purchased this convection toaster oven/broiler from Amazon based partially on the good customer reviews.
I was replacing an old as dirt Black & Decker toaster oven.
My family and I have been very pleased with the performance of this appliance.
From simple toasting, to reheating pizza, to making side dishes, this oven does it all.
I have used it to bake both in conventional and convection modes, toast, and reheat with excellent results.
The digital controls are simple to use, even my kids could figure it out.
It's great to use on a hot day when you don't want to heat up your kitchen and it saves energy too.
I have made baked potatoes (yum), frech fries, mozzarella sticks, bagel bites, cookies, to name a few things.
It is a very versatile kitchen tool and looks great too!.
We've had this appliance since early 2006, and a day doesn't go by that we don't use it.
It heats evenly, and it's nice not to waste the energy of using our stove when we can just use the toaster oven.
Even if holding down the button would advance the number of minutes, that would be less annoying than pushing the button for each minute.
This is only truly annoying when we need to bake a potato for a long time or something similar.
but I suppose that is our laziness talking.
:)  This is still a stellar performer, and it was an excellent investment.
To make toast, you press the Toast button, select a browness setting (1-7), and press start.
When you press Start, the timer begins counting down the time -- for example, 3 minutes, 34 seconds for setting 4.
This means I have to re-set the clock every time I clean the oven.
I was initially very skeptical about paying so much for a mere toaster oven.
However, the low end models I used to own were always disappointing.
Several reviews here say you can't bake with this.
Maybe I don't know how to cook, but I've found baking with the convection setting very satisfying.
Also, the interior dimensions are even larger than I expected.
I was able to fit a FiestaWare pie plate inside.
I've baked muffins and small loaves of bread, and I think they come out wonderfully.
All of the special settings for toast--defrost, bagel, 4-6 slices, also work very well.
With my old B&amp;D, I had to hit the toast button a dozen times to toast two bagels.
With the Cuisinart, you just pick the right setting, and it comes out perfect.
If you use your toaster oven a lot, and could maybe use second, smaller real oven, this product is perfect.
If you're just making toast, it's probably overkill.
I received the toaster oven about four weeks ago and I haven't tried all its features yet.
However, though it is smaller than I expected the toaster is solid and well designed.
There are a lot of features which make this toaster very accurate and easy to use.
Finally, the toaster missed a five star rating because in certain positions the broiler tray is a pain to slide out without the rack.
All in all I enjoy the features and quality of this machine.
I have just started using a toaster oven, so I'm still getting the hang of incorporating it into my everyday life.
I purchased a toaster oven so that I could still do oven cooking without heating up the entire kitchen in summertime.
I have found the pans that came with this oven to be rusting badly.
I typically purchase high quality cooking utensils and pans so I am very disappointed with the quality of the pans.
Looking for replacement pans is nearly impossible as apparently the oven interior is of a "weird size".
I am unable to find the size to replace the pans that came with the oven.
I have to say that this toaster oven is a good one.
I bake everything from cupcakes, meat, biscuits etc.
I hope they do not stop making them.
We are on our second one simply because of looks.
The first is on the back porch where we bake/no toast outside because of crumbs and ants maybe.
What we learned is after you remove the food from oven, just leave the door down.
Finally enamel started to gently start coming off.
I guess this is simply caused by heat.
I will miss the Cuisinart Toaster Oven when they take them off the market because they do everything small great.
It does get warm so we pull it out some from the wall and from underneath the cabinets.
It is no problem for such a great toaster.
Keep it clean, with the easy pull out tray, and this little oven will treat you well.
We use it 2-3 times on average every day and have never had any problems.
We bought it when our regular toaster went on the blink.
It does not make five-star toast (that's what a toaster's for) but it toasts good enough for us.
It also does a great job on cookies.
Cook them on a sheet of non-stick foil (my favorite kitchen tool) for easy cleanup.
Just remember to thank me when you devour your first perfect bagel.
I can roast vegetables quickly in it, and even bake muffins.
The room doesn't get as hot as when I use the big oven, though there is some heat that escapes the front door.
It heats up super quickly and cleans easily, too.
I can finally bake again! And not just bake, but bake like I have never done before, even with big gas ovens.
I haven't cooked a chicken yet, but I have used most of the other capablilies of this well designed appliance.
It's one of those things that you'll really like.
It's well made, well designed and doesn't have useless bells and whistles you won't use.
The toaster:  it does a nice job on the top side of the slice, but the bottom side has the lines from the rack.
This little oven will bake cookies, toast various items, and generally work exactly as it should.
I only works when you use the oven.
Still, these are minor and this device works much better than others we have had before.
It does an oustanding job on convection baking (chicken, game hens, small leg of lamb, etc.) and broiling (salmon steaks, chicken breasts, etc.).
You cannot go wrong with this little beauty and its versatility, and it's perfect for a one or two person household.
My old Black and Decker died a few years ago and I foolishly tried living with a regular toaster.
I'm cooking for one, though I often make casseroles and whatnot to freeze so I don't have to cook meals every day.
I tried a T-Fal from an electronics store and fortunately they took it back after I found it didn't do anything particularly well.
I then bought this at a discount from a big box retailer.I was hesitant to buy something with all electronic switches.
My eyesight is poor and I worried that I would have trouble reading the buttons.
As it turns out it's pretty intuitive and user-friendly.
The baking is great; I've made small cakes, biscuits, scones, and casseroles using the convection feature.
A 4 1/2 pound chicken came out  juicy and crispy.
I plan on making yeasted sweet cakes for the holidays, and expect that they'll be better than they were in my oven last year.
Spatters that usually spread throughout a large oven get concentrated in the small one, but it's therefore faster to clean up.
The timer is easy to set, and when done will keep beeping until you press the timer button again when you check your food.
Cuisinart TOB-175BC Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler, Brushed ChromeThis oven is used most every day, and has proved to be a solid performer.
As time passed, I have used pretty much all of the functions of the oven, and learned to customize settings.
I have not had a single problem with the oven since the day it arrived.
We love this toaster oven and use it every day.
It heats up quickly to the designated temperature and is easy to use.
Saves us using propane oven (in RV) and saves on electricity.
Don't know if this model is still available, but I agree with other posters that this is a superior product.
I hated our old DeLonghi and find this superior in every way.
It's an excellent small oven - I do a lot of sear-roasting and this is much better than heating up a 4 cu.ft.
Sometimes you have to fiddle with the settings a little, but this is a very minor inconvenience.
Bought this on the gold box special for $109.
Bakes at same temperature setting as big oven.
Baked bread and got a nice crunchy crust.
without making it mushy like the microwave does.
I don't make too much toast, but it seems to do that just fine as well.
This is easily one of my favorite appliances.
I have the unit for over 3 years, use it everyday for breakfast, kid's lunch, and dinner, it delivers.
This is one of the few things that actually make life easier.
I got this food processor mainly because I hate chasing carrot pieces around the kitchen as I cross cut them.
This has proved very useful and time saving for me and my teenage daughter is showing renewed interest in cooking.
This is the most quiet &amp; most efficient food processor that I have bought.
The others I have owned, in the past, failed to the quality of this one.
I've owned this for 3.5 years and use it almost daily.
In fact, I'm not sure how I did without it for so long.
Even my better half who loves those expensive knives utterly fell head over heels for this unit.
Perfect for salads and food prep of all types, this is one of the most used products in our kitchen.
Great size for small families, it's a little work-horse that performs as good today as it did 3.5 years ago.
Well built, powerful enough for most items and sized right.
No extra frills, just a very good food processor.
Remember to not wash the clear plastic with the abrasive side of a sponge or it will scratch up all the faster.
This is the first food processor I have owned so I do not have much to compare it to.
My only complaint is that when I made a soup that needed to be pureed, the soup went everywhere.
The food processor leaked from the bottom before even turning on the machine.
I have made a variety of other dishes in this with no problem such as hummus, salsa, etc.
I bought this food processor almost on a whim.
I unthinkingly used one of my other spatulas to scrape the bowl one night and the blade cut it to ribbons.
I needed a food processor for occassional tasks.
I have a blender that just doesn't cut it (no pun intended) on some jobs.
This food processor is well made and can do a lot of different things.
I bought it for my boyfriend (the chef of the house) for Christmas, but he really doesn't use it very much.
I've had this processor for nearly a decade now and it is still going strong.
Nothing leaks yet but a replacement bowl costs over $30  and the lid is another $15.
This appliance is used frequently enough to warrant a permanent place on my kitchen counter.
It easily handles a variety of food prep tasks.
I'm especially pleased that Cuisinart has solved the locking problems that plagued early models so am glad I gave this brand another try.
got one for my wife and ones for my daughters.
If I had a larger family, I might invest in one of the larger processors.
First off it weighs a ton, which really means something with motors.
I never thought the difference between a regular food processor and a Cuisinart would be so dramatic, but it is.
This is by far one of my favorite appliances.
We all know the quality Cuisinart is known for.
This appliance is very heavy, and can do some work for you!  I use mine for the normal, slicing, shredding, and chopping.
This comes with a great video that shows you all about your appliance.
One of qualities that I enjoy the most is the no nonsense design of this.
Its easy to put together!  All of the parts go into the dishwasher too.
You can ask for much more than what this appliance will offer to you.
Overall, I am very pleased with this product.
However, after about 1.5 years of use, it now leaks out of the sides even when filled to half its capacity.
Still - overall a great product, but has not stood the test of time.
Purchased in 2001, this machine has functioned without fail, though not without mishap, throughout the timespan.
The accompanying booklet gives good basic pie crust and bread dough recipes which work perfectly and oh so quickly.
I would have rated it 5 Stars if the table turned more easily.
Maybe I caused sawdust to get in the track - ?? I oiled the track.
Great price, smooth rotation even with very heavy items on top of them, well made.
VERY EASY TO INSTALL, AND WORKS VERY WELL FOR LARGER ROUND TABLES.
SAVES ON HAVING TO PASS ALOTOF THING AROUND.
I needed a spare blender and this one looked interesting because of the food processor attachment.
The food processor is best for small chopping/mixing jobs; it obviously cannot compete with my wife's Kitchen Aid 11 cup heavy duty processor.
The good news is the blades are sharp (ouch-I nicked my thumb while cleaning it).
You get a mini-processor and blender for one price.
Because most of us are wannabe chefs, this will meet or exceed most of our needs.Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
This blender works well but time will tell.
I went by the reviews and tried this blender.
Of course it's loud & you can smell the motor at times but that's because it IS a blender after all.
Other than that, I like it just fine.
The blender part of this product is awesome.
It crushes ice like nobody's business, it mixes, purees, stirs, and of course, blends.
It's made of glass, so it's easy to clean and doesn't retain any weird odors.
It comes apart very easily, so it's easy to clean.
Also, the blender comes with a wide base, so when taken off the motor part, it stands surely on its own.
With a bit of practice (and a paper towel below the edge), you shouldn't have any problems though.
I recommend this blender highly for its ability to perform its function superbly.
I was kind of weary of bying a combo because it might've been too good to be true.
It's made of plastic and it sits securely on top of the motor.
It's pretty tight, so you can chop even tomatoes and there won't be any spills.
You can control the speed at which you're cutting stuff in the processor.
I wish though, that the processor came with additional parts, for example, for slicing.
Overall, though, it's a pretty decen beginner-to-medium food processor.
It serves me well in the kitchen (perfect for crumbling graham crackers for cheesecake crust!)Overall, the product is definitely worth the money.
This combo is a great solution - even if for some reason you won't like the processor, at least you're getting a superb blender.
It crushes ice nicely and powers through everything I threw at it.
The stirring spatula was nice for getting the mixture out and stirring while it was going.
It was quite loud and would get a little warm sometimes after heavy use.Food Processor:I rarely used this.
I made a few pestos,  used it to make herb rubs, pasta dough, bread crumbs and mince veggies for meat loaf.
I wouldn't bother with herbs unless you have a lot of them.
It got me by for the little bit I used it.A couple days ago I turned it on and it just quite.
and hour later I tried it again and it was ok.
I feel we got our use out of it.
The blender is easy to use and the kids love it for making shakes.
I haven't used the food processor since I'm accustomed to doing this function by hand.
It isn't big enough for a large family, but I hope to remember to use it soon.
Well built product and does the job great!  Made of good quality stainless steel and great for those tiny mash jobs.
I stick it in the dishwasher to clean its so easy.
This one I bought from amazon is a gift for someone in my family.
The smaller size is great for meals for two people.
Can use in smaller bowls as well as larger bowls.
I don't actually like Avocados, but I make a delicious refried black bean dish and I use this to make it wonderful.
I also do a garlic sauce called Mojo de Ajo and this gets the perfect consistency of garlic.
I use lots of mashed bananas and avocados, so I'm adept at mashing with a fork, but this is so much better and faster.
It's great for egg salad, deviled eggs and any other small volume mashing job.
Maybe it's because I have hands the size of a child, but I really enjoy &#34;little&#34; utensils.
You know what? I'm not sure if I've ever actually used this to mash an avocado.
But I have used it loads to mash other stuff, like beans, potatoes etc.
It's smaller than your average masher and very sturdy.
Bought this specifically for mashing avocados, and it does the job well.
Seems to be well made, and doesn't bend (when I accidentally cut a slightly unripe avocado).
Haven't used it for potatoes, but seems like it would work ok for a small batch.
The Best (Manufacturer's Inc.) 11-inch Masher with Metal Handle is on my essential list of kitchen utensils.
I like lumpy mashed potatoes, so I mash them for a short time.
I use an up-and-down, twisting motion with the masher.
If you want creamier mashed potatoes, simply add more warmed milk and mash them longer.
Spoon out your mashed potatoes into a serving bowl, and soak the masher with your pot so clean-up will be easy.
i make my own herb butter and guac this lil guy does the job very sturdy and easy to clean.
I've tried so many syrup dispensers all of which dripped, and often the flow mechanism would get stuck.
This one is the first which has neither problem.
I had a simple but working syrup pitcher which I stupidly broke by running hot water over it just out of the fridge.
I then began a purchasing frenzy of some of the poorest quality dispensers imaginable.
Some dripped horribly; others leaked when tilted, and most did both.
They all had plastic lids or those fake chrome lids - my old dispenser had a plastic lid but it never leaked or dripped.
The only sweetener I use much is honey, so it is left out a lot.
I also have the WMF stock pot and find they make top quality products.
If you ever need to buy a honey or sirup dispensen, that's the one to get.
You cannot go wrong when you buy one of their products.
I have bought so many honey dispensers and they were all a disappointment.
This one is by far the most expensive but so glad that it was worth the money.
The quality is great, nothing plastic and it really works for pouring honey neatly.
It also looks good on the counter top due to its sleek design.
My only wish is that maybe someday the manufacturer considers making a larger size one.
I use honey as the main sweetener and have to refill this one every week which is a pain.
I will be on the lookout for a larger one.
So I am many things, but a honey dispenser installation expert I am not.
This is a beautiful piece for my kitchen but for the "not so mechanically inclined", a little hard to figure out.
The rubber ring goes on top of the glass, and the metal piece seals around it.
Whew!  I am now enjoying it every morning.
About the cleanest way to pour honey without drips.
When the honey crystallizes, just unscrew the top, give it a quick zap in the microwave, screw back on the top and you're in business.
I picked up one of these at a thrift store.
Next to my commercial sized one,only an Excaliber is a better product in my opinion.
I love dehydrating foods! I have never owned any other dehydrator, but this is simple to use and I've had NO issues with it.
I would warn you that the plastic fruit leather trays are expensive for what they are, and pricing is non-competitive.
I'm brand new to the raw/natural food & dehydrator craze.
I can munch on a handful of excellent zucchini, banana, or sweet potato 'chips' made in this dehydrator and feel like it's a guilty pleasure.
Who knew?  Easy way to get your daily serving of veggies.
Every time I use it I've got all 6 trays going at once, at capacity.
If you're gung-ho raw foodies (or a bigger family) you might want to order more trays from another source.
Amazon doesn't seem to sell them, but pleasanthillgrain.com does.
They also sell the L'Equip as listed here, but charge more.
The rectangular-shaped L'Equip fits just right on the side of my kitchen counter.
I paid through Amazon, but the 877myjuicer folks shipped it out to me.
that is, you only get enough fruit leather sheets to fill just ONE of the 6 trays that come with it.
So if you're planning on making lots of fruit leather etc.
I HATE to clean up after I impulsively do my 'cooking', so I only have two other gadgets.
A mandoline slicer, from Benriner (high quality Japanese brand), and the 'cook help' spiral slicer.
This little pup turns a yam, squash (whatever) into huge handfuls of thin angel-hair 'pasta'.
Much sturdier than the sprizalooli or whatever it is that other thing's called.
When I make a pesto angel-hair pasta from a yam or some other root vegetable, I get my 'cooked' friends hooked in an instant.
I love my spiral slicer.The L'Equip I ordered from Amazon, the Benriner(s) I got from eBay.
I've already used it for our garden produce - tomatoes, summer squash, purple basil and flaxseed crackers.
At 1/3 the price of some of the popular dehydrators, this has done a fantastic job.
It would be really difficult for this to over-dry things unless you're really lazy in checking it for multiple hours.
You do have to rotate trays, the drying unit is on the bottom, but this hasn't been a real inconvenience.
It's great there's a temperature dial (not sure how accurate it really is or not).
I like that the unit isn't round and is quieter than the cheaper units.
I don't understand the outrageous cost of the most expensive units.
Heck, you can get a full sized stove for just a hundred or two more.
There's a lot of raw foodists out there that are the reason these companies charge ridiculous prices.
I have been wanting to purchase one for awhile and finally did it.
I did some research online to decide what to buy.
This one was highly recommended on many websites for its great temperature control.
I have only used it a few times - I have dried bananas and made fruit leather.
It will get alot more use this coming summer.
It has been extremely easy to use and clean.
In the end, I feel like this one does a great job!.
Alright, this was my second purchase of a dehydrator.
I purchased the STX model and the heater broke within two weeks.
(They refunded me promptly) so I bought this one.
Mine came with 6 trays and also the small screens to keep little bits of food from going through the screen.
Don't worry about the motor being on the bottom unless you foolishly load this with soaking wet food it will never be an issue.
This product dries faster I think because the whole unit is sealed so it has no problem heating up.
Hard to explain but it just feels like quality.
Here is my opinion: if you are planning on dehydrating food and you are not planning on literally large scale dehydrating, buy this unit.
The STX held more but I never was able to fill it.
This will hold about 8 pounds of hamburger.
That is a lot! Besides, you can add trays if you want to.
Also, don't get caught up in "even drying".
There will always be trays that are drier than others and areas that will dry more than others within a tray.
Imagine having a piece of notebook paper in your hands full of dry much rooms only with a 3 inch hole in the middle.
Now tilt the paper towards a bowl or whatever.
A lot of food will go through the hole.
All in all I really like this dehydrator.
I've had this unit for more than two years and we use it frequently.
We grow our own herbs and we dry them five or six times per year.
I had quite forgot to do a review and today we are dehydrating basil, thyme, oregano, mint, and bay leaves.
Not jut with the dehydrator but with other L'Equip appliances (I own their variable speed blender and love it).
The unit is easy to operate and comes with an easy to follow instruction book.
Along with the regular trays you get an insert for making fruit "leather" (home made version of "fruit roll-ups").
Reasonable care should eliminate that slight possibility.We are quite happy with this and we do recommend it.
This is the only food dehydrator I've ever tried, but it works great.
I've been unimpressed with most dehydrators out there.
You can put a lot of food on this one and it works fine.
No extra parts to buy for when you do small objects.
Temperature control is nice, since some foods do better with more or less heat than others.Six very large trays is a huge advantage.
With other dryers, you spend hours doing just a little bit here and there.
And it seems as though you never really get a lot accomplished.
First, they should add a variable speed fan as well as the variable temperature.
When foods first go in, they push out a lot of moisture which can condense on the top.
It eventually pushes all that out, but bumping the fan speed would help.
I invariably lift the top a few times at the beginning and wipe it down and let the moisture vent.
This aids the drying time by eliminating a fair amount of water.
Doable, but a controllable air flow would help.I'd also like one of the racks to be a bit taller.
Food on the bottom dries out quicker than that on the top.2)  Move the food on the tray around part way through.
Bought this a year ago and it has run almost non stop drying everything from eggs to all kinds of fruit and spices.
If mine ever gives up, I will buy another.
So far I'm extremely pleased with the L'Equip.
First off the unit is built to very close tolerances.
It's nice to see that the trays snap together almost like Legos!  The next thing I noticed is that it heats almost instantly- very impressive.
And in operation it's almost dead silent.Airflow and drying is very uniform.
There's minimal need to swap trays around, but for long drying projects it will be helpful.
The variable temperature control is a good feature and it works quite well.
I was a bit concerned that a 500 watt machine might not produce enough heat but those fears were unfounded.
Perhaps it's the shape of the unit, or maybe the fact that it fits together so tightly, but it generates a lot of heat.
In fact, my first batch of jerky really got way too dry.
It was my fault; I didn't expect the meat to dry nearly so quickly as it did.
But so far I've done apples, peaches & bananas and all came out great.
As I write this I have some garden tomatoes and some zucchini drying.As some have noted, the included fruit-leather/catch trays warp pretty fast.
To this I say- so what?  They still do the job.
If you want to make a lot of leathers  you'll probably get a Sil-mat anyway.This is a great dryer.
The only minor knock I could give it is that the capacity isn't huge, but of course I knew that when I bought it.
It's supposed to be able drive a dozen trays, so it's expandable.
It's simply too small for someone who wants to preserve the output of a huge garden.
The great ergonomics and near-silent operation will win you over.One last note; obviously I can't yet comment on if it will last for ten years.
But before purchasing the unit I did e-mail the seller.
So the provided e-mail address is valid and response is quick.
I did my research on food dehydrators and the L'Equip was recommended above all.
I like the rectangular shape that makes it easy to sit on your counter top without looking bulky and taking up much needed space.
It is about the size of a small microwave.
I did not like the way it was round and would take up a lot more space.
The L' Equip motor and fan is on the bottom but it is covered so nothing will fall into it.
I have dried apples,pineapple,coconut and bananas on it so far and it takes anywhere from 6 to 10 hours.
I plan on using this often to make healthy sulfite free snacks and ingredients for my baking.
It also has a 12 year warranty which is really important.
Look for reviews that contain many purchased items, that seem legitimate.
I just pat my meat dry and place it in the trays.
Just remember to season your meat before you put it on the trays, otherwise your salt, garlic, etc will fall through to the motor.
The trays are extremely large and I can do a whole roast at once.
Haven't used the fruit trays yet, but love the fact that so many things are included with this item.
This is a great system !! Almost ALL kernels pop into a big plump morsol.
It's fast to use, about 3 minutes for all to pop, which is about the same time as a microwave.
We've tried several of the included recipes, and they are great, about 25 different recipes are in the instruction manual book.
i finally bought a whirley pop after wanting one for years.
here are some facts:though its pan is lightweight, that seems to be a designed factor.
if it were heavier, it would hold enough heat that you'd burn the popcorn when you removed it from the stove burner.
with its lightweight construction, it's easy to pop just about *every kernel* with any burning at all.
and my wife, who's a triathlete and not much of a snack food eater, didn't stop 'til the bowl was empty.
neither did i.the kettle is very easy to clean.
i make it a point of dumping the corn promptly into the waiting bowl, and then running cold water and some soap into the kettle.
i wouldn't pay extra for nonstick -- it works fine as it is.the popcorn seasoning is great, too.
i don't add butter, and the popcorn tastes better than theater popcorn.i like this gadget so much i've already given one as a birthday gift.
and unlike other gadgets, this gets used at least 3 times a week.
it's much better than microwave popcorn.in fact, typing this review makes me want to go make a batch right now.
I recently got one of these delightful popcorn poppers and have really enjoyed using it.
I've got a microwave I reasoned, whats the point in buying this thing.
This popper lets you control how much fat and salt you use and that alone makes it worthwhile.
You'll remember how it used to taste when you were a kid.
If you like butter flavor, melt the butter separately and pour it over, you can't use butter to pop the corn - it burns.
But if you're not allergic to peanuts, peanut oil is just about the best thing you can use to pop in.
It adds a nutty flavor thats just so good with the popcorn and salt that most of the time I forget the butter entirely.
You might not think that a gizmo like this could make any difference.
at least not enough of a difference to notice.
Most of us went through the hot-air popper stage, and now we're in the middle of the microwave popcorn craze.
The Whirley Pop makes such delicious popcorn that I know I'll never pop corn in the microwave or in a hot air popper again.
The popcorn comes out both tender and crunchy, and I haven't seen a single unpopped kernel yet.
On top of that, it's fun to use.
The reviews are true, this popper is a super way to make  popcorn.
As other reviewers have pointed out, the thin construction of this popper is the key to it's great results.
It heats quickly and cools quickly, so the corn pops quickly and does not absorb too much moisture.
Nor does it burn as long as you use the built in stirrer constantly as the directions clearly state.
I usually compromise and use this popper to make healthier popcorn.
You only need use a tablespoon of oil, then dress the popcorn with Molly McButter.My popper was made in the USA.
I don't have to worry about gouging my hand with a screwdriver anymore - when I open these buckets.
I was able to remove the lids from 5 gallon buckets with the least amount of difficulty ever.
We had a Bucket Wrench for ever and used it daily.
It finally wore out even tho it was aluminum.
We ordered this one for practically nothing and it works better than the old one.
These are the only way to open a 5 gallon container.
I've been eying these glasses for a long time, but couldn't justify the purchase until recently.
I had a set of heavy crystal Mikasa wine glasses that were quite handsome, but as I said, heavy.
Recently diagnosed with Arthritis in the thumbs and wrist, I used that excuse to purchase these beauties.
Gave the Mikasas to younger friends and we're both happy.
These glasses are exactly what I've wanted - light enough, but sturdy enough for daily use.
And they do get used - daily!They were packed carefully and the shipment arrived on time and in perfect condition.
When I need new glasses I now just go straight to Luigi Bormioli's Michelango Masterpiece collection.
I started with some Martini glasses, bought one set, liked them, bought 3 more; then I did the same with these glasses.
I also got some Bormioli Duos Latte mugs somewhere in there too, which were also great.
They are easy to hold, very clear without discoloration, and quite durable relative to their heft.
This is the second bunch of this wine glass we bought, and so far (six months) haven't broken one.
That's much better than the first dozen we bought.
I bought this second bunch to replace the first dozen that all slowly gave out.
I'd give them five, but the first batch just were touchy.
So, wash them by hand and with real care, and enjoy a lovely glass at a good price.
These are very classy, solid feel, hold a lot of wine, and are a great value.
Save your money on Reidel's and get these instead.
(No, we were not drunk when we did the destruction, welllll, maybe a little high?) I decided to get some sturdy glasses.
The rim of the glass is perfect, they feel good in your hand (not heavy at all) and the stem is easy to hold.
I guess you can say I'm hooked on Luigi Bormioli.I highly recommend Bormioli, a quality item with an acquirable price.
They look great on the table, sound pretty when clinked together for a toast.
Thin lipped but sturdy,  dishwasher safe, design fits your hand without slipping.
Slim design fits in top rack of dishwasher.
I like Bormioli Michelangelo glasses, the glass quality, design, ease of cleaning and durability.
But, my wife found this design too heavy in the bottom and too thin in the middle of the glass.
I will continue buying Bormiolli glassware, but not more of this one design.
These are very nice glasses with a quality style.
They also looked very nice as water & milk glasses near my fine china at Christmas dinner.
The weighted bottom part is crystal clear and solid.
When lying face down in the dishwasher, the bottom is flat so the water does not pool during the rinse cycle.
They come out unspotted that way bec they dry faster, without that pool of water on the bottom of the glass.
The weight in the hand is very nice & they feel like quality.
The lip is good, so if you prefer to rest your glasses facing down, they won't get those flea bites you hate.
I was so pleased that I bought more glasses from this company.
I suggest you look at all of the Luigi B glasses, they have different offers, such as 6 of the same glasses.
perhaps a better deal depending on what is on sale at the time.
I got mine on sale & then bought another 6 when the price went down for a short while.
They are nice and heavey on the bottom and the glass is the perfect thickness.
I shopped around for several weeks trying to decide what glasses I wanted.
They were exactly what I was looking for.
They wash well in the dishwasher and come out sparkeling.
Will be buying another set in the very near future so I have 8.
I can fill this up with ice and still get enough tea in for a nice cool long drink.
Weighted at the bottom so they won't tip over.
Am impressed with the quality for the price.
I got the 14.5 and the small 9oz size and find it's a perfect combination of glassware.
They look great with my fine crystal wine glasses.
Are somewhat fragile so probably not a good idea for kids/teenagers.
Luigi Bormioli is the Libbey Glass of Italy.
Bormioli produces good quality, attractive, and inexpensive glassware for everyday use....in Parma.
Every so often I have to replenish the stock, glassware being, well, made of glass.
very good price also, i would recommend buying.
I bought these primarily for my boyfriend to use, as a moderate rocks glass upgrade.
So far, we like the shape and weight of the glasses and did not have any breakage as mentioned by some other reviewers.
If we continue to be pleased, we plan to buy a second set.
We had a set of these for years and my husband dropped one in a bad spot and it broke.
We only had one set of four so bought these.
They are definitely chip resistant and I've dropped several in the sink with never a problem.
They are easy to hold, a good size for cocktails or juice and stay crystal clear after years of washing in the dishwasher.
These are great glasses - the bottom is nice and heavy and has a good weight to it.
I did receive one that was cracked upon arrival, but Amazon refunded me for 1 out of 4 glasses.
I've been putting them in the dishwasher with no problems.
These are attractive glasses which have enough weight to feel good quality and so would be hard to knock over by accident.
Bought these because they coordinate with the Michelangelo wine glasses we purchased in the past.
So far have gone from the bar to the dishwasher with no problem.
Very Classy!  I like the streamlined look of them.
These are the most use glasses in my cabinet, I must say!.
I love these glasses, they feel great in your hands: the weight the shape are just right.
These 12 oz glasses are the perfect all-purpose size.
We have several sets of the PM515Ks, the taller ones, white wine glasses, and red wine glasses all from the Luigi Bormioli Michelangelo masterpiece series.
Good feel in the hand, nicely made, reasonable price.
I'm having trouble adding to my red wine glass collection, but I have been able to find the other styles as needed.
Hopefully, this is not a duplicate review, as I posted one earlier that did not show up.I now have about 15-20 of these albums.
They are the best I have used so far.
However, this page side can alternatively hold (1) panoramic per page side.
Only on few occassions with handling with my kids, have any pictures been jostled loose.
This forces you often to leave some spots blank, if you want to limit an album to groups of negatives.
This album hold 300 photos and is pretty well made.
Compared to most photo albums out there, it's cheap.
What more can you say about a photo album?  Pretty well-made, holds photos, easy to put them in or take them out.
I've been using these albums for years and I really like them.
I have many of these albums that are over 20 years old and they have held up beautifully.
These are the only photo albums that I use.
I like simplicity of this album, as well as the option of placing photos either vertically or horizontally.
You can also add descriptions if you want to.
I've made albums for four of my grandchildren so far, and am now working on the two youngest.
These are exquisite glasses, with what I see as a modern Japanese-style discordant indented pattern very pleasing to the eye and to the touch.
I like these glasses except for the indentation at the bottom.
But a quick  run through the dishwasher cleaned them up nicely.
I have purchases nice expensive sets of glass tumblers in the past and they all break pretty easily.
I bought this set because they were a bit cheaper so if they break I wouldn't be as frustrated.
However, I have yet to break a single glass in this set.
The thick bottom makes the glass feel more stable and less likely to be tipped or bumped over.
The four indents in the side of the glass help with gripping.Overall, I would definitely buy these glasses again.
If they chipped or broke I really wouldn't care because all glassware seems to and these are pretty affordable for a 16 piece set.
July 2010:  My original review fom 2 years ago appears below and I'm not changing a word.
These glasses may be cheap on Amazon, but they look and feel great, with a great weight to them.
The style is simple but interesting, and also ergonomic, since the indents in the sides of the glass make for easy handling.
I purchased a second box of these glasses after breaking a few of the tall ones from a set I bought about seven years ago.
I have arthritis and weakness in both hands and easily loose my grip on a glass.
I purchased the first set at Costco which no longer has them so I was VERY happy to find them on Amazon!.
Until we moved to a house with a new dishwasher that doesn't dry very well.
The nice shape that makes them seem almost hand blown creates a dimple on the bottom where dishwater collects.
So, be careful how you load them in the dishwasher.Anyhow, I really like this set...so much better than what I had.Enjoy!.
I spotted this glassware in a restaurant we were in and I've been searching for a while.
Well, low and behold right here on Amazon.com, (I should have known) here they are.
I don't know what the fuss is about them breaking so easily.
I read the reviews before I bought, but being familiar with Libby products, I bought them anyway.
Oh, and I even put the glass in our refrigerator ice dispensor and the ice goes in fine, no breakage of the glassware.
these glasses are so pretty! i love them! you can use them for casual every day meals and also would look awesome at formal dinner!.
I got these for christmas, and they are beautiful glasses.
Some have complained about durrability, but they seem to be pretty rugged.
They are glass of course, so they will break if mishandled.
They are not perfect quality, with some portions of the glass thicker than others, but you'd have to look hard to notice that.
If you want super high quality, you can pay 4  or 5 times as much.
At 4-1/2 inches tall holding 14-1/2 ounces and 6 inches tall holding 17 ounces, these two sizes are perfect for most beverages.
Most sets provide you with three graduated sizes of 6 each and the smallest is always just a little too small.
This set of 8 of each size acknowledges what most people need.The feel and the weight of these glasses complement the intense color.
They are thick enough so you have a comfortable rim to drink from.
This thickness makes them a slightly heavier glass that feels really durable.
Originally I was worried the top flare may make them more suseptible to tipping, however, this does not seem to be true.
DEEPLY colored - true cobalt blue! FIVE STARS!2.
These glasses will crack and break even with what I consider ordinary use.
Unfortunately, buying the thicker, more durable glasses means paying several dollars more per unit.
I've bought another set of these this year rather than go that route.Hope this helps!.
We bought a set of these because we have anumber of friendds who lend us time and effort with the new cabin in the woods.
So when they show up and help with yardwork or doing the clapboard cedarshakes on the cabin, they brave the heat and the bugs.
The glasses speak of quiet elegance, and is not what anyone roughing it expects.
The glasses are a very deep blue, and are very attractive and distinctive.
We really enjoy them, and they have been sturdy enough to last us the better part of year undamaged.
I've had them for a month or so and haven't broken any.
Original review written 6/7/2003:These may easily turn out to be some of the nicest glasses I own and I was only after everyday stuff.
They are weighted nicely, ultra-smooth to the touch.
Now that's not bad for over 3 years of constant use.
these are now my only glasses because I gave my other sets to my sister.
and I hand wash, with (I think) every break happening because I dropped them during washing.
I've had no problems elsewise and who in the world would be dumb enough to STACK GLASSES anyway.
There has been no fading, no chipping, with the original set still looking good as the day I got them.
Obviously I like them since I'm ordering another set.
Some of the other reviews gave me to think they were thin and flimsy, but they're actually fairly thick and quite sturdy.
Not quite as thick as, say, a pub glass, but closer to that end of the spectrum than the other.
This don't look like a set of glasses you would get for $15.
I bought these thinking I'd use them as back-ups when I ran out of other glasses or had guests.
Now I use them as my main set of glasses and I love them.
I keep forgetting what a great deal they were since these would look good in any kitchen.
They appear to by much fancier than they are.
I am so glad that we purchased these glasses! Even drinking ice water on a hot day feels like a celebration with these classy glasses.
They are more durable than regular clear glass (tipped one over on my counter and it didn't break!) and as previously indicated, easily stackable.
Now with free shipping, they are even better!We purchased ours two years ago (and I reviewed them then, under a different username).
Since then, we have lost only three to breakage.
We will purchase another set - I'm so afraid they'll be discountinued, now that they are marked as clearance items.
I bought these because I love the color.
They are made well and should last a long time.
I collect cobalt Blenko glass, and try to get items that either compliment or match it.
I tend to have the dropsies, and I can't tell you how many glasses I have broken in the last three years alone.
I have already dropped two of these, one onto a hardwood floor, and no breakages so far.
I bought them to have a complete cobalt kitchen set going on.
I only have a couple pieces of this set left, but I keep them put up for the memories.
Bought this set to replace a similar set that has dwindled in number over the years due to breakage.
The color is great and the glasses are fine.
I would like them to be a little thicker glass --more like the original set we had.
Not only are these glasses utilitarian yet aestheticly pleasing, they are also functional.
They have saved a great deal of space in my small apartment kitchen because they are stackable.
By stacking them two or three high in my cabinet, I've been able to reclaim a lot of valuable space.
They are the perfect size for a drink on the rocks.
It's a great deal buying them on Amazon.
Even if you accidentally drop them they don't shatter.
I loved them so much I purchased the matching iced tea glasses.
All pros and no cons for this product.
Use them at home along with the 7 oz juce and the 16oz beverage as our standard every day glasses.
These are not for fancy dinner party time, break out the crystal for that, but for day to day these are hard to beat!.
I really like how sturdy they are and how clear they look.
So I dialed up Amazon on the ole PC and order these, along with the 16 ounce version and the juice glass version.
The look great and feel good in the hand.
So far no issues, glass is heavy and seems durable and hard to break.
I can only find these on Amazon now, it looks like Libby is discontinuing this glass.
I've used this style for a few years, and needed to buy more.
They are a good size and weight for the hand, are solid, heavy and easy to grip and wash, and 12 ounces is just right.
It hard to find a good overall glass but this is my decided favorite.
Also, Amazon packaged this very well, everything arrived in good shape.
If you're looking for a sturdy, user-friendly glass, look no further.
They're tough, easy to hold, and, I think, classy looking.
For every day glasses, I don't think you can beat them.
These were purchased to increase my number of the same glasses.
I've had these for years and they are beautiful, heavy (but not TOO heavy) and very sturdy.
Very well made and they stand up to everyday wear and banging around.
Handles have a good grip, not hard on the hands.
This is the best can opener.Additional notes: Friends buy one of these just for your pet food.Can openers can collect a lot of bacteria.
The best way to avoid this is to immediately rinse the 'cutter' with hot water.
Over time, gunk can still build up behind the cutter.
Or, as Aretha once sang, "Who's zoomin' who ?".
Years ago my Dad said this was the one brand to buy.
I use a tooth brush and clean mine after each use and then pop in the dishwasher weekly.
Might not have to be as heavy as the old one that worked so long, but it does work well.
Swing-a-Way is still the best can opener around, even if the durability has slipped a bit since they were 100% American made.
The mechanism still works really well, and the blade is sharp, and cuts very cleanly.
It's still a great product, but no longer lasts for decades.
I bought this can opener after reading all the positive reviews here on Amazon.
These reviews don't lie!  I have had this for a little over a year, and I am very pleased with it.
It has opened many cans for me since I've gotten it.
I previously had a KitchenAid can opener from Target, which I had high hopes for since it was the most expensive one there.
That one was in the trash within a month, and it's not like I live off eating canned food either.
Although at first I was thinking this can opener was a little expensive, it's ended up being well worth the price.
NOW WHY CAN'T EVERYTHING BE MADE THIS GOOD? OPENS CANS AND LASTS AND LASTS.
JUST WHAT WE WANT...ONLY ONE IMPROVEMENT I CAN THINK OF: STAINLESS STEEL PARTS.
You cant buy a better hand operated manual can opener!  Thats not right, you cant buy a better can opener period.
This is the best can opener you can buy, except for the wall mounted swing away can opener.
With that modification it would be the perfect can opener.
It is easy and smooth to operate and mine hssnt left any jagged spur on the lip of the can.
Why spend $3  for a cheap can opener that are difficult to use and hurt your hand and quickly wear out.
Spend a little bit money and get one that will last and are a pleasure to use.
still means something to the fine folks who build these.
I wish they would invite me to their Christmas party, I think I would like to meet them!!.
Sometimes I could do it and sometimes I couldn't.
Life is too short to have to struggle to open a can.
It resembles the type I have been using since I was a kid and expect to use for many years hereafter.
No mysteries about how to operate this one! So, if you are looking for an inexpensive, old-fashioned can opener, look no further!.
It's still going strong 3 years later! It's also opened a few beer bottles for us, so it's done its job well.
It is a very weird thing that even simple purchases I used to make without thinking can be researched now.
If you need a cheapo can opener, this one is good.
Yes, this is the second best can opener I have ever had.
Its solid, chunky, strong engineering is hard to beat, and a true delight to use.
The only fly in the ointment is that the company has contracted the production to China.
My family has had this can opener for over ten years.
I also love the bottle opener on the side!.
There is little to say about a can opener.
You place the opener on the can and turn.
In a few seconds you have separated the top from the can.
This one is over 3 years old and you would never know it.
It looks new but above that it works as if it were new.
This is the best hand can opener money can buy.
We had to replace our old one after many years of service.
As for comments that it is hard to clean.
Over the years I have bought extras, to have one at work, one in the car, one at home, and one for every dear friend.
This is the perfect self winding can opener.
I have had it for some time now and it is still working great.
Throw away your electric can opener or give it to the Goodwill.
It is easy to use, compact, and it WORKS!  It is simply the best.
It still works as well as it did 25 years ago.
The white handle is off-white now instead of bright white, and the blade and gear area isn't shiny.
You couldn't buy an electric can opener back then for the same price, they were much more expensive, but they were made to last, too.
Certainly the quality appears to be as good now as it was then.
So regardless of how you feel about the place of manufacture, the quality is still there.
I love this can opener, my Mother had one & it lasted her life time.
Does not require too much power to open.
It was great decades ago and it's great now.
This is the original Swing-A-Way can opener that my grandparents used, and it works just as good today as it did then.
It is tough, reliable, and built to last.
It opens cans easily and cleanly, every time.
I can't ask anything more of a can opener than that.
It does have a bottle opener on the side and I'll allow it that minor frill.
Highly recommended, though it's likely to be the last can opener you'll ever buy.
It was at least twenty years ago when someone recommended Swing-A-Way manual can openers as being magically the best.
So - I remember - I bought two of them, one for home and one for the office.
Then I must've found a good deal on an electric can opener because I bought one and installed in under a kitchen cabinet.
And the truth is, I don't open all that many cans, especially now that my beloved aged kitties have gone over the rainbow bridge.So.
Here I was with a can of coconut milk and the electric can opener simply would not open it.
Cuz the new but familiar, heavy-feeling, well-built manual Swing-A-Way opened it with nary a whimper.
The electric one? No, I'm not replacing it.
My parents who are both deceased used this can opener and it always cut well.
I thought the quality would have changed after all this time, but every one I get is excellent.
If you have cats, you might want to buy two.
One for cat food and one for cooking.
:)Now, this can opener is gear driven so you do have to work harder than if you purchased a automatic can opener.
I just don't have room for one, so I prefer how easily these store in the drawer.You can easily remove lids from any size can.
The handles are comfortable and the precision-crafted stainless steel will last a long time.~The Rebecca Review.
I have blasted through 3 other can openers from Walmart and Target this year that all broke after a few uses.
Growing up, my house had one can opener.
Even though it was ancient, it always worked perfectly.
Because of that, I was extremely disappointed when I went through a few cheaper can openers.
It's heavy and sturdy and it cuts smoothly.
I'm so happy with it, I bought a second.
With minimal physical exertion, it opens cans like it is supposed to.
It doesn't need batteries or an extension cord or charging or excessive cleaning.
If stuff gets on it, you rinse it.
If it's really dirty, you throw it in the dish washer.
it just deserves five stars from the "it does what it should without any qualms at all" point of view.
If you want a can opener that opens cans and you don't want to spend $30, get this or one like it.
The SwingAway can opener still seems to be terrific after all these years.
The real question will be if it will hold up over the long run.
I am extremely pleased with it after two months of use.
It cuts easily and smoothly, even on dented cans.
I like it a lot.Update:  It's still working fine after two years of use.
Our 20 year old, no frills can opener broke and we decided to replace it with something manual, yet modern.
This Amco Swing-A-Way is fast and smooth to operate.
I'd certainly buy another in 20 years if it lasts that long.
Okay, to be fair, I didn't buy several can openers to verify that claim.
I haven't the funds or long-term motivation for such trivial endeavors.
Well, good news! This can opener IS that mythical unicorn you've been chasing after and fawning over.
Okay, none of that is actually going to happen.
But, at least you'll be able to open that can of &#34;Soup for One&#34; in preparation for Tuesday night's Seinfeld rerun-a-thon, you poor, poor soul.
I use it everyday and opening up cans is so much easier now.
I'm personally not fond of white as a color for just about anything except major kitchen appliances.
If this can opener had black handles, it would rate five stars (and it would fit my kitchen decor to a tee).
I sincerely disagree with the comment that this can opener is not as good as it used to be.
I have tried them all, believe me, and, most, you have to struggle with to get them to fit on the can right.
I have never had a Swing-A-Way opener to fail.
I have gone back to it and I have stayed with it.
I never put it in the dishwasher, steel will rust, eventually.
The best way to care for them is to swish it in hot soapy water, after using.
I, also, leave mine spread open for a bit to further air dry, before putting it back into the utility drawer.
It still looks and performs like new after several years.
This is definitely better than all can openers including electric can openers in my opinion.
In fact, I just read in another review that some are now made in China, so the quality may have gone down.
This opens 180 degrees and it's easy to clean.
Easy to use and less messy than electric can openers.
I've seen some cheaper versions, but this one looks like the original.
I've never owned a China made Swing-A-Way so I guess this will be a risk purchase for me.
For the price this can opener fits the bill.
I use it often to open cans and have not had any problems.
The grips are comfortable and it has survived many trips to the dishwasher and back.
But its the best I have ever used.
The can opener I had was becomming difficult to use and wasnt opening cans well.
There is some effort to turn the handle but hardly and resistance.
It cut cleanly all around and doesnt leave a spur.Its a pleasure to use.
