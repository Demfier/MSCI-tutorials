My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.
She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker.
She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.
I was hoping there were more where those came from.
This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however.
There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops.
There is a "Fresh and Fruity" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled "I Scream for Quick Pops!", "Bake Shop", and  "Coco Loco".
As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on "Tips" and "Techniques" are useful.
There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual.
The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops.
Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well.
On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults.
There are flavors like "Cookie Dough", "That's a S'more", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly.
Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients.
The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor.
The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors.
Mango and orange together make a terrific pop.
The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes.
For fruit pop recipes, "Top Pops" by Emily Zaiden is far better.
This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend).
There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy.
The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too.
They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty.
After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.
I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.
Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.
For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.
We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.
Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.
This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow.
It helps you to understand the Zoku better.
It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds.
These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit.
It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice.
I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku.
Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.
The Zoku accessories are pricey, but the recipes have the exact amount you need to make the pops.
I have made it through 15 varieties so far, and I like them all.
Clear and helpful information, and then some superb recipe suggestions clearly outlined.
The recipes in this books are tedious to make.
I found that easier and simpler recipes can be found online.
I had no problem with the recipes online working in the Zoku maker.
This beautifully illustrated book featuring ten colorful,glittery butterflies is a favorite at our house.
I got this as a gift for my niece and she loved it.
It's a super cute book and ill be getting it for any other nieces that may come along.
This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep.
The colors and the butterflies, and the cute story all were a hit.
A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations.
Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color.
, is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland.
The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly.
As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears.
Each page mentions the color twice and an animal.
The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old.
The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies.
A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again.
My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.
I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.
It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.
I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young.
For a novice cake decorator who got talked into making her son's wedding cake, Wilton makes lovely cake decorating accessories to help with every step.
For a first wedding cake, it was amazing with Wilton's help!  This book is a must have for newbies like me.
I should not have bought it because it comes free from my cake decorating class.
Oh well, at least I gave the other copy to my sister.
i added an image of a cake i made according to this book lessons, which i advice anyone who is interested; to get this book.
excellent book, shipped on time, packaged nicely, helpful tips in the book, good price.
Very good experience, very happy with the product and vendor.
don't use it much but when i had it's been useful.
I recommend it to all who wants to learn how to decorate cakes.
Good book for beginners who need step by step instructions and guidance.
Got this for my girlfriend who runs a baking business and she said it was handy to have for a reference book.
She said it is handy to have when thinking of decorating ideas.
I'm hoping that I can learn how to make gum paste flowers to perfection for my daughters wedding, and maybe a few other cakes.
This 128 page book contains pictures and patterns for 38 tiered cakes.
It gives you instructions on how to assemble cakes on stands, pillars or stacked construction.
It also contains recipes for basic scratch cakes in white, yellow, chocolate, strawberry, and banana.
It also has the recipes for standard Wilton Icings, fillings, glazes, fondant (not the tasty marshmallow kind), color flow, gum paste, and candy clay.
There are tips for baking, leveling, torting, filling and icing the cakes.
It also gives some instruction on how to cover a cake with fondant.
There are suggestions for transporting tiered cakes, calculating servings per cake and cutting guides.
The book also includes patterns and instructions for various decorations.
As with all Wilton books, the last few pages detail products you can buy from them to duplicate all the designs in the book.
The problem is that some of these items don't seem to be available on their web site any more.
Still, it's a great idea book and I'm sure you can find acceptable substitutes for a lot of the items.
The first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake.
The second class is where we bring in our own cakes and learn how to stack or pillar them.
It's a great way to top off the other four classes.
I am very happy I purchased this book as it containes so much great information and time saving tips.
This book isn't much help if you are not taking the wilton cake decorating classes.
you can get the basics but its really just a visual for the class!.
I have always wanted to learn how to decorate a beautiful cake, and I purchased this guidebook along with The Wilton Pastry bag kit.
I do, however, agree that this book did appear to be an advertisment for thier products, but the guide was helpful nonetheless.
This lesson plan is perfect for a beginner and definitely helped introduce working with fondant in a user-friendly way.
Each and every little hint that helps you to make your flowers appear real is in this book! You cannot go wrong with this book.
You will find yourself reading it over and over, makign flowers over and over.
You will see that your self-esteem will roar! People, co-workers, family members, friends will be dazzled and amazed -- and so will YOU.
It cannot be purchased from Wilton (which is a real crying shame).
I think Wilton is afraid that if they sell the book, they will miss out of selling classes, but not so.
Having bakes/cooked since the age of 9, I really didn't feel it was necessary but boy was I surprised.
I learned more in my first class than I had in years of teaching.
Wilton honestly needs to sell these lesson plans.
Not only will receive money from the classes, but they will also make money from the books.
Why would a company prefer their customers buy their books from someone else??? I've not figured that out.
Getting back to this lesson book...you will be extremely, extremely happy.
Your income will increase for making beautiful live-appearing flowers that you sell on your cakes.
Please try it...you cannot fail!!! Best book ever on making and decorating flowers!!.
This dvd is a must for any cake decorator.
It is presented in short and easy to understand segments.
It works great for the beginner or as a quick refresher.
The instructor did an outstanding job of both explaining and demostrating?.
I loved the book, very complete, detailed, clear instructions and easy to learn procedures.
It is a comprehensive guide, useful for success in the art of pastry.
This has certainly improved my cake decorating knowledge as a pure novice.
I will now purchase the other books so I can learn more.
Even this is the 2nd course, it is easy to follow.
I don't sell cakes but make them for friends and family.
This is only a hobby so I don't make cakes everyday.
I can pick this book up and follow the directions and get great results.
I recommend this book most highly with its inspiring and easy-to-follow instructions.
My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.
I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.
I would definitely recommend not only buying this book, but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class.
Shows several types of simple, easy to perform techniques.
I would recommend this item to anyone! Works great for baking! I would buy again.
I got this for my daughter in law.
Is shows how to use all the tools in the kit.
I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner.
I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator.
I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set, that I have found very useful.
I bought the cake curved spatulas, from Amazon,that work very well.
I also bought the bench knife, and found a 16" cake lifter, and a 18" cake leveler.
I got all these great ideas from this book.
I bought other things in the book from Amazon, however, the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything.
My youngest daughter requested this as a gift.
She was very happy with it and I may buy another one for my middle daughter.
I saw this book at Target and flipped through it.
Cake decorating has always been a hoby for me.
This book is excellent for us self taught decorators.
It is a basic book for beginners and it is easy to understand.
It has a lot of ideas and I recommend it.
The Book is very easy to read and follow it breaks down working with fondant and Gum Paste very Simple.
I loved all the information I found in this book, very good ideas and pictures I recommend it to new beginners.
I am thoroughly enjoying being able to learn at my own pace.
Also, not ordering next book until I finish each book.
Very motivating and thoroughly entertaining to all who are subjected to guessing what I actually made.
I love Wilton books they are always so attractive and enjoyable to browse through.
Still I have learned so much about cake decorating from them.
GREAT FOR BEGINING!! has all the things you need there are very few things i dont use from this kit !! would recommend!.
This is more of a packing review than a review of product.
The book does what it's intended to do.
It came in 24 hours so I was grateful for that.
This book is great for beginner fondant makers.
I was able to follow the instructions and tips and they helped a lot.
i learned how to make butter cream roses out of this book, very nice step by step instructions, easy to follow.
This book is amazing! I love how Wilton publishes books for every stage of baking! This book is a must have for beginers!.
I was a little disappointed in this book when I first got it.
There is a helpful section called "The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate", and there are about six pages of recipes.
Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas.
Maybe this one was an earlier print, but my classmates and instructor's course booklets were a few pages different.No biggie though.
This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes.
I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator, and very good at self-study on many topics.
This book was recommended by my cake decorating instructor.
If you want to get started on cake decorating this is the book for you!.
I have never been a good cake decorator.
It has always been just out of reach.
This book made me say &#34;duh&#34; in my head so many times it's embarrassing.
It really breaks it down and simplifies some of the basic techniques for noobies (like myself).
Lots of interesting and helpful information for a beginner.
My daughter loves to bake and this will give her a opportunity to create much more.
Easy to follow even for a clutz like me! Very informative and the instructions are straight forward.
Im new to cake decorating so I have really enjoyed this book.
There is step by step instructions for different designs and ideas and lots of hints and tricks for working with fondant and gumpaste.
Bought this book when I was hyped up and excited about baking and decorating cakes.
Although the designs are very outdated, it is very informative and I enjoy taking it out to view on occasion.
She said it has good instructions and pictures and was helpful.
I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful, but so much of it is advanced, and I'm just not there.
This book sticks to basics which, for me, is essential to focus.
If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious.
The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well.
Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though, so no big deal.
I've always loved cake decorating, ever since I took my first Wilton class.
Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.
The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.
It's a lot of fun but, I admit, a bit frustrating.
No matter how closely I follow the steps, my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.
I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book, as all Wilton Lesson Plans, it's great.
THIS WAS EYE CATCHING AND WHEN I ORDERED IT I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT.
I learned a few tricks from this book.
I am new to baking nice looking stuff.
This helped me become a better decorator and got courses 2,3 and 4 as well.
Took class years ago, using this as a refresher before starting a cake.
Sometimes a video is faster than a book.
What a great book to help you get started on learning to decorate cakes.
I am trying my best to get into FONDANT and THIS book has motivated me to try harder and harder.
This short-but-sweet (ha) book gives all the basic information you need to get started with cake decorating.
It shows how to make a number of shapes with the icing, an icing recipe, and has lots of helpful illustrations.
If you can learn from just looking at a page on a book with a few written details, it will teach you without expensive classes.
But if you are using in addition to the class, all good too.
Keep it handy to look back at once in a while as a resource.
The book is full of color pictures so very well illustrated and the directions are clear and easy to follow.
I also bought the class kit to go with it and it works great.
would recommend for people wanting to learn how to do this on their own at home without a class.
I needed this for my third Wilton's class, and it was cheaper on Amazon.com than in the store.
It's part of the curriculum, so it's required.
Whether it is good for skill development or not, I take my classes very seriously, and get alot out of them.
I also believe in checking prices everywhere for the class supplies.
Amazon was cheapest, and I received it in 2 days, free shipping, Amazon prime.
I really like all the helpful information in this book.
It even has a recipe to make your own buttercream icing.
I'm glad I purchased this item on amazon.com.
This is a small simple book but tons of basic information on baking.
I really loved the graphs regarding the piping tips - I have so many of them but never knew what exactly do they do.
So that was really nice to figure out everything on the chart with the pipe tip number!.
I do have some background in cake design, but this really helped me take it all to the next level.
I still need lots of practice with flowers so this is perfect for me.
I would have liked a few more tips and a bit more direction, but on the whole it was worth the money.
I use to cake decorate as a kid in 4H, this book was a great refresher.
Helps me make gorgeous cupcakes for friends and family.
This book shows you how to decorate different items.
It explains the in's and outs of doing it.
THis book has been real helpful to my daughter.
She is just starting out and has made some really good flowers with this book.
The product was very easy to use and it will have you making some beautiful decorations of flowers and other decorations.
I highly recommend this seller for their speedy and excellent product.
I purchased this book without taking the course.
Cake decorating classes in my area are almost nonexistent so I have to be self taught.
Lots of pictures and detailed instructions will guide you through the beginning of cake decorating.
I have almost every Wilton Yearbook since 1977.
I still use them and review the back issues frequently for ideas.
I do do not like the newer issues as much because I do not care for fondant, so I love the older books.
On the whole, I like this book very much.
Sure enough, it made it easier to do everything, there was less hardening and bumps, and everything looked prettier.
great book, so many fun ideas..can't wait to get startedgreat product, fast shipping.I love the Wilton books and will keep buying them.
with four kids I'm really getting into doing their own cakes for their birthdays.
Learned alot and looking forward to creating the wonderful creations they show on the book.
I'm a Star Wars fan and I bought this with the intention of using it for groceries but it turned into my new diaper bag.
It's huge! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse.
It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it's so cheap.
I got this for my bf and he loves it.
The stitches on the sides failed so I had to re-stitch it.
That held well but then the plastic lining on the sides ripped.
My bf used it daily for several months before I had to replace it.
Overall a good product but wish it was better made.
This makes a great reusuable gift bag for the Star Wars Fan.
Well made and fun design for fans of the original movie.
The art work is nice and the print is very clear.
It is easy to use & works very well.
I like the auto turn off so you dont run your battery out.
The only drawback is that the buttons are very small.
I would love to have the same product with bigger buttons.
it replaced a franklin spelling corrector i had  since 1989.i don't like the plastic case.
i broke a fingernail trying to open it.i purchased the new corrector because the characters were more readable than the older model's characters.
It has ten thousand words in it's data base.
It's quick to check things and it also stores all her friends' phone numbers, etc.
Fun and easy to use, there are more and more of them appearing in the classroom now.
Works well but wish the display was just a bit larger.
For the money it does what I want and I would buy it again.
I used to date this girl who loved Scrabble.
So, by association, I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.
I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble, at first, but then I came to love it.
If you're all "cheating", then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.
Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).
I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!.
Demo must be cleared every time you turn it on.
Slow if input is incorrect & may require a crazy input to get proper spelling.
This one seems to be made better than my Seiko spell check.
I like the cover on it as well.
If you are a crossword addict you need this product.
It works for my daughter, accurately finding words that she has no clue how to spell (e.g., "becuz" immediately found "because").
The one that arrived was black; she and I would have preferred the blue that was pictured.
I love to do crossword puzzles and this is a fun product to help me find or figure out those impossible clues.
Yeah I know you can cheat and check out online answers but I prefer to challenge my grey matter.
I had one of these for years before it finally died (even with replacing battery it stopped working properly/easily).
This was perfect for propping up textbooks so that I could take notes.
This book stand is highly adjustable and functional.
It works great for most moderately sized hardcovers and paperbacks.
For overtly thick professional books you may have to consider The Easi-Reader Bookstand which is much studier.
Holds my law books up perfectly! The stand Also allows you to turn the pages for easy reading and use.
Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff.
SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.
I am using it to take notes for study.
Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it.
This is a very versatile book stand that is easy to carry around and easy to store.
It is ideal for smaller books and for those readers who don't need variety of reading angles.
However, it can accommodate larger books as long as you are a bit careful how you use it.
In addition to books, it works really well with a variety of electronic book readers and the new generation of tablet computers.
I've used it with myKindle Wireless Reading Device (6" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)and iPad.
The first holder that I bought broke after a few months of use.
It will hold your book where your want it to be.
It will save your neck and keep you hands free to take notes or whatever as you read.
I just keep it in my backpack at all times.
It handles my 1000 page law books, so no worries in that department.
I see other people clunking around those huge, expensive wood book stands.
I bought one for myself and everybody that sees it loves it.
It's very light and easy to carry around.
I like mine so much, I bought extra ones to give as Christmas present to my mom and other family members.
Holds even my Big study Bible well, and let me write my notes below it.
Great for Students.Looks too small to support a big book, but it does, and folds up light into my backpack.
I've used plate holders and even copy stands from the stationary store in the past, but this is the Real McCoy.
Quite steady when used with a medium to large size book.
For small softcover I would use something else though!.
I use this for everything from propping up cookbooks in the kitchen to reading hardcovers at my desk while eating my lunch.
Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.
Works great for everything, but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.
It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).
Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.
Sturdy while not impeding the process of actually reading/viewing the book.
This mug is fantastic, it washes well, has a good weight, and can double as a nifty negotiation tool.
I've been eying this cup for awhile now and finally broke down and purchased it.
Great concept but finger holes seriosly too small.
I bought this for my boyfriend and he just loved it!It was really good quality for the money.Very cool mug.
The finger holes are a little small and hard to release the cup if you use all 4 holes.
Just use the top two  and the large hole with three fingers and it works great.
Was a little smaller then expected but over all good product, durable and very cute.
This is as described but for some reason, I was still expecting it to be a little larger.
I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices, sandwiches, cucumbers, etc.
It's the perfect size for what I wanted.
This cookie cutter is perfect for use with fondant and making impressions in buttercream icing to be traced over.
At first it seemed off, meaning it was lopsided when placed on the table, but I was able to straighten that out.
I received it super fast considering it came from across the country!  Overall, I'm pleased with the item and the seller.
It's a little small but  that's OK (keeps  one from overeating too many cookies.
Seems very solid and Ithink it will last.
Have not yet used it but the cookies are sure to be micro.
I really like these ice trays, because they for one have a cover and therefore prevents any freezer odors from getting in.
Also, they stack nicely on top of one another.
Another thing I like is the Purple color lids.
I would definitely recommend these to my friends.
I don't use many ice cubes, and they would evaporate form the tray before I used any.
When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray, I was delighted.
The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator.
These are by far better and less messy.
They do work very well and a little water on the bottom pops them right out! A great product!.
These ice trays are awesome!  Highly recommend!!  Keeps ice contained and fresh!!!  Definitely worth purchasing even if they cost a little more than other brands.
I have used the same ones for over 10 years and they still aren't showing any signs of wear.
I purchased these to freeze baby puree and they work great.
With the covers, the puree will not be contaminated by other odors in the freezer.
The cubes come out easily too, just need a twist by holding both ends of the tray and they will loosen up.
I prefer these citrus peelers to using a knife to peel oranges and grapefruit.
It's safer and easier to pack in a lunchbox.
These disappear in my house the way socks do, so I'm glad to have a half dozen of them.
I like the handle length on these and the added bonas of not having to use my nails for the pith removal.
I have had the finger ring style, Already gave 2 away, Hope I don't loose them in DW.
Months later we are still using this inexpensive set of citrus peelers to help kids peel their oranges in our school lunchroom.
These are great - like we used to get at parties but different colors.
These are handy items so I was glad to find them.
They were a fun item for our Christmas stockings.
I needed just one more of these but this set was too good to pass up.
I like having more that one color too.
This allows me to score an orange before slicing off the rind to make perfect garnishes for mixed drinks.
if you have never used one of these to peel an orange or any citrus you do not know what you are missing.
they last for ever and work every time.
I always seem to lose my orange peeler.
Good product but when all colors are shown, that is what I thought I was buying.
These do what I expect them to do, which is to provide an excellent seal and be durable.
A little pricey but can't argue for the quality.
They are useful for storing small objects such as buttons, beads, scrapbooking items, paperclips, and similar items.
At Tupperware parties, the Hostess recommends running the lids under hot water to loosen them up so they fit easily.
If you do this, then they work well for carrying aspirin or vitamins.
I had looked high and low for a 1 ounce souffle cup and lid set for our lunchboxes.
The only ones I could find were disposable, and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.
Most containers aren't big enough to hold them.
These are perfect.* They have plenty of room - I don't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close.
I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins.
9/9/11 Update: I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins.
I think it would hold 20 if you work at it.
The bonus is that a snug lid means I don't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins.
Nice!My daughter loves these in her purse, too.The uses are practically endless (aspirin, gum, paper clips, skittles :)HIGHLY Recommended!.
With this container they can get them any time and I don't have to worry about them dropping the glass jar.
It's great to carry on picnics or to the lake.
very convenient, draining feature is great & goodcapacity.
if only it wasn't colored so you could see the contents a little better & know what wasin there.
i have a bunch of these in my fridge, & it's always trial and error findng the olives, pickles, sundried tomatoes  artichokes.
i get there in the end, but if you could see the contents better, cooking would be faster!.
It holds jalepeno peppers and make it easy to access them - 'cause the jars are not user friendly!.
Works great for storing anything you need to keep submerged in liquid in the fridge.
I typically use mine to store celery in water.
we make pickled eggs, also known here as red beet eggs.
The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.
The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.
I've had mine for five to ten years, and it is still good as new.
She had her red beets eggs in a jar, which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.
I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.
I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.
I also know someone who uses hers, without the strainer, to store brown sugar.
This container is larger than the one that I had previously.
It will hold a 1/2 gallon of home made pickles with the liquid easily.
Keeps them fresh and makes it easy to get your pickles out instead of having to leave them in the jar they were canned in.
Great set to start with or to fill in the gaps.
No frill, and no damage after months of use.
I like the three pronged forks; it's fun and different.
These are good because they are inexpensive, but they are not the most aesthetically pleasing and are very light weight.
we have the bowls, cups, and plates from ikea and love them all.
They are a great quality, perfect size, and the thicker weight of the plastic makes them feel just right when holding them.
The lip/edge is curved enough so it doesn't feel sharp.
They also have a pretty wide base, which I imagine helps them tip over less.
My 2 year old does good with them, and I like to drink juice out of them as well.
These don't quite make the dimension, and are a bit smaller than I was hoping for.
However, I love the colors, and haven't had a problem with spilling yet.
This is the double set, so you get two of each color for a total of 12 cups.
They are not very translucent, if that matters.
These are great to bring up to the pool since they are plastic.
They are small, but perfect size for a glass of red wine or any drink.
They are definitely &#34;kid cups&#34; but suitable for adult drinks as well.
(ages 2-8)  Bigger kids are okay, but they really work size wise for the young kids.
I was doubtful about getting two sets of these, but I am glad I did.
They don't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill...and there is ALWAYS a spill...it isn't so bad.
I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf.
We've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine.
they are the perfect size for kids to they don't get to much of whatever they are drinking.
They wash nicely in the dishwasher, and the colors are vibrant.
You get 12 small tumblers in this order, they are just as they appear in the picture.
They are sturdy, IKEA quality, they will last years.
I like the matte texture that acts as a grip agent on the bottom half of each cup.
They are not BIG cups, but that is actually perfect for my students.
With grandchildren, this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional.
I bought two sets and had my daughter take one home for their use at home.
We bought these before and have lost them over the last year or so.
I reordered because I trust these cups.Easy wash, comes out of the dishwasher without being tweaked by the heat.
Good size for children's hands under age 8 and holds enough to satisfy a child's thirst.
The ribbed bottom helps prevent slipping through little fingers too.Overall, really like this product!.
I was looking for tumblers to replace the use of paper cups in the bathroom.
Unfortunately, these were a bit too small for what I had intended.
They appear to be well made and were helpful when I had visitors with little kids.
with 6 grandchildren, these are perfect and easy to find in the grass:)  They are sturdy and just the right size for little hands.
We assigned each family member a color, and purchased 3 sets.
They are wonderful, and they don't tip over due to the proper design of the weight distribution of the liquid.
For any person over 6, you need to drink 2 cups of water to feel like you had one cup.
The metal is a little more thin than I imagined but it is cute.
Easily bendable, it can become hard to close, but it can be bent back into position.
Got this for my daughter for Christmas (2 year old) and she loves it.
She's at the age where putting things in to boxes and taking them out can occupy her for some time.
She loves putting little treasures in here and taking them all over the place.
The size of the box is like that of a metal lunch box.
We haven't had any problems with it and it is quite durable for a play date.
I like it, but the material it was made can bend easily.
My son love it it match with his collection.
My son is a huge Curious George fan and one of his favorite stories is the one where Curious George Rides a Bike.
So, it couldn't be a better lunch box for him.
My grandson loves Curious George and he like to carry things like this around.
I think he will love and and put some of his animals and other things in it.
I got this so I am able to carry snacks on the weekends.
We are never home so when I saw this I had to get this.
First our toddler loves curious George and second it was just darling.
Best part so easy to clean with just a wipe.
It's perfect in size not too big or small.
Kids are really into Curious George so they love this tin box to keep all their &#34;stuff&#34; inside.
I already have one of these I had purchased a year ago on Amazon, and, I absolutely love it.
It does a great job chopping onions, pecans, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.
I ordered this one for my daughter, and, she loves it.
I use this mini a lot more than I use my food processor.
The size works great, especially when baking!  I highly recommend!.
Was a little skeptical of how this would hold up.
It gets much more use than the larger cuisinart.
Besides myself being a Cuisinart snob, I will say that I wouldn't use any other product in my kitchen.
This does a wonderful job on small jobs such as pestos, or making peanut butter.
This one chops very good specially garlics, onions, etc.
As usual Amazon did it's thing and got this mini chopper out to us in a jiffy.
Yep, it do a mighty fine job and with very little effort! Sliced 1" thick and quartered a nice size purple union.
Zap, zap, zap with the neat lever and wa-la, fine chopped union with no juice.
Took three sweet pickles and zap, zap, zap again and got finely chopped pickles with no juice, ya-hooo.
Hummmm, gotta get out tha Gum-mbo pot now.
Get to tha store and get some assorted goodies.
Hey, it's File Gumbo time and I'm gonna be "King of tha Kitchen" again.
Now ladies, sorry! Your he-man is gonna lay claim to this here "power tool" "toy" for himself, lol.
Yes, and it's a dandy looking little thing too.
Long life, who knows, but today it's a gooood life! It do seem to be sturdy and solid enough for a long life.
Bought this for my Mother who had her version from about 8-9 years ago finally die out.
This purchase was a replacement for the one the kids broke trying to operate it.
I liked it enough to purchase it twice.
I also own a large food processor (also a Cuisinart) that I use for substantial tasks like making bread dough, slicing vegetables, etc.
It has performed very well at all of these tasks and years later, still has lots of power and cleans up beautifully.
It is fantastic and I could not say enough wonderful things about it.That said, I do have a couple of caveats.
The first is that I would never buy it as a primary food processor.
It is just too small for normal tasks.
Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor.
Using it in an application like this would take forever.
However, it's great for doing basic chopping tasks because it is so easy and light to pull out onto the counter and efficient.
I also love how the stainless steel look coordinates with my appliances and other gadgets.
Overall it is a great product and if it ever dies I am likely to replace it with another Cuisinart.
Bought this to replace an old Mini Cuisinart Processor that was worn out (it was about 12 years old).
Love the red color, matches my toaster and coffee pot.
Use it for small jobs instead of dragging out the big food processor.
I have to puree my veggies and fruits.
I am a fanatic about kitchen appliances, specifically Cuisinart.
Not only was I not disappointed, but this has become my most-used kitchen appliance.
I can mince garlic, make guacomole, turn garbanzos into hummus, and perform a host of other useful tasks.
It is perfect if you want to make something quick, and don't won't to drag out the heavier, full-sized food processors.
But, it's better to do smoothies in a blender anyways.
Got this over a year ago for my mom in law and it's still doing its job! :) Fantastic.Good for salsas, sauce and more.
He brought this home and well, I've been loving it ever since.
I do mostly use it for onions, but it is wonderful for spices and nuts too.
I don't like the way it cleans up, however, it can be a little much when you do onions.
You HAVE to put it in the dishwasher for sure if you do onions because the plastic definitely holds the odor.
Wish it was glass! Great machine for the money and I highly recommend it.
chops evenly and clean up is a breeze.
I've been using this almost daily for about a month.
Easy to use, easy to clean, and looks nice on the counter.
No real complaints, except that the bowl feels kind of thin, like it would crack easily.
I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier.
I hope I'm wrong about the bowl, but I guess only time will tell.
My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube.
Obviously I knew this when I purchased it, but hindsight is 20/20.
This mini-prep-processor is the second Cuisinart product I have bought from Amazon.
The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven.
The careful engineering and attractive, simple design of both products impress me.
Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion.
Anyway...this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving.
Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day.
The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew.
Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.What good timing! I put that Little Honey right to work.
I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere.
That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds.
I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.
She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition, but does well with her customary food.
I tried using a blender, but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.
I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the "cheaper" one.
I am impressed with its performance, ease of use and compact size.
It is clearly worth the small price I paid.
I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.
It is perfect for my intended use, and I can envision how to use it in cooking.
This little baby is a must for any kitchen, from making salad dressings and marinades to salsas.
Just big enough that I use it for most of my food processor chores; rarely do I need to take out the big processor.
Quality food processor which is just the right size for the small batches needed by a couple.
You don't need to process a large amount most of which would spoil before it was all used.
Works great for small jobs including powdering some spices.
I also flip the blade over and shred onions with it.
If you fill it up too full it will not work well.
It is also very easy to clean up.
We received this for free when we purchased our Cusinart convention toaster oven.
We've used it to make small amounts of pesto or garlic sauce.
We've also used it to grind up fresh bread to make bread crumbs.
Given it's size, we had to feed it one slice at a time, but that was fine since the recipe did not require a lot.
So for small items, it's does a good job.We have noticed an electric burning smell if it's turned on for too long.
It's annoying, but not too bothersome.We have a 20 year old full size Cuisinart Food Processor that's still going strong.
The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp.
If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect.
It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too.The unit comes in steel color and white.
Before you buy a food processor, consider what you typically process.
If you do coffee, smoothies, pesto, chopped herbs and nuts and salsa, this may just be enough, saving you dollars and space.
I was a bit leery about this model and hesitated given the price.
Pesto, bread crumbs (including a batch of WAY overbaked croutons that were rock hard), spices, coffee beans, graham cracker crust (for a very tiny pie).
This is a great size, easy to operate, beautiful look on the counter.
The warranty is the very odd number of 18 months, so you get the idea it's not supposed to be a workhorse.
But used as recommended, I'm sure mine will last "forever".
I had one of these which i burned the motor out on a few years ago.
Kept using the mini processor attachment on my blender ntil today.
Bought this same model in stainless at Big Lots for $29.
So glad to have this back in my kitchen once again.
I may never have to pull out my large 11 cup Cuisinart (1992) ever again.
I received this as a present and was convinced I wouldn't find a use for it.
Much to my surprise I love it!  It sets on the counter next to my DLC7-Pro.
It is a whiz for chopping a cup ful of nuts for a recipe, making quick bread crumbs for meatloaf, chopping herbs and making dressings.
The blade reverses for chopping or mixing so make sure to have the side up you want for the task at hand.
It is easy to use and a breeze to clean.
I just pop the soiled parts in the dishwasher and forget it.
I would not want to be a day with out this tiny wonder.
This does a good job of pureeing things for my mother and it takes up relatively little counter space.
I can rinse the parts quickly and easily after I've prepared one food and move directly on to the next course.
This is a MINI processor, and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs, I have the "big boy" to do that.
I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs, so I don't have to use the big one.
I use it a lot to make home made dressing.
Clean up is easy and quick, as is the machine.
It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices, etc.
I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking.
It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well.
As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well.
The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up.
Bought this as a gift for my daughter in law.
She has used it a few times and loves it.
I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now, and it is still going strong.
It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts.
And the size means you don't have to be using a large volume to get great results.
Recommended by my sister and now I can too.
I use this all the time to chop up nuts, grate hard cheeses, and make small batches of hot sauces.
Works well when you don't want to pull the full sized food processor out and assemble it and then clean it afterward.
It'll chop a good sized onion up to start a pasta sauce, or a couple of hot peppers for a finishing to a stir fry.
Very handy and pretty well built even for couple time per week usage year after year.
I replaced my original mini-prep with this item after the plastic housing on the steel knife split.
The first one lasted about ten years, and I used it quite often, tho it was not abused.
I lost my old one when I moved, and I tried a few different types, but I was never happy.
I use it pretty much every day and it never fails me.
I had a smaller chopper of a different brand but wanted one that had a little larger bowl.
Great for chopping smaller amount of veggies and stuff.
Does what the big ones do only with smaller amounts.
I like that it does not have a long chute sticking up on the lid.
It pulses nicely and chops up garlic and onions quickly.
I also liked that it had 2 speeds and you could pulse.
I bought it for its small size to put in my camper, but liked it so much it has a place in the house.
I crush dry beans and dog kibble easily and fast.
Have no need to process large amounts at a time as it would not stay fresh.
This one works nicely, efficently and cleans up so easily.
Easy to use, clean and is versitile for wet foods and dry foods.
I would purchase it again for gifts if need to.
We have purchased many food processors over the years.
I saw this on a cooking show and immediately bought one.
Best small processor ever!!  Others do not pick up all of the pieces off the bottom of the processor.
This one picks up everything and creates a smooth blend of everything.
Buy one for yourself and pass them out to the kids as Christmas presents!.
I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming.
A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s.
I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds, and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy.
I bought this unit to replace one I had purchased in 1995 or 1996.
I ordered the new Black Chrome finish and it really is lovely.
It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute.
If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine.
This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc.
I haven't had any problems with the old one because I did that very thing when it first arrived.
It is the perfect compliment to the larger processors and I would highly recommend it.
For such an inexpensive price I think it is worth it!.
A time for every seasoning......and a utensil for every purpose.
The Cuisinart Mini Prep does not serve well as a primary processor for heavy jobs.
That was not its intended design, or function.I obtained my first mini prep as a promotional gift with a DLC-7 purchase.
For many years they have been contributing to my cooking enjoyment as a problem-free, complimentary team in a busy kitchen.
I upgraded the old DLC-7 that is still mechanically perfect, with a MP-14 TM Limited Edition.The Mini Prep perfectly compliments larger processors.
It performs equally well making pesto, cr&egrave;med butter, chopped fresh herbs, including garlic, chopped nuts, small portion purees, deviled eggs, spreads, and speedy fresh salsas.
It has a fast and slow lever whose function I like because they may be "pulsed" on and off with an instantaneous response.
I especially love the function of the two (tiny) holes on the lid, along with the ease of the lid's removal for ingredient additions.
I have been using the Mini-Prep for a few years.
I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.
I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.
In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.
I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.
On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.
Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.
Just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it.
I wore out my original one, so this purchase was a no-brainer.
I pulse/chop carrots for salads, and just this use is worth the price.
Carrots are so good for you, and I like small pieces of carrot in salads, not chunks like you get with a knife.
I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces, dressing, and grating single servings of firm cheese.
This one is just like my old one, except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking.
This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.
It works well but is a little smaller than I had expected.
This is my fault and not the fault of the machine.
I bought this to grind mustard seeds when I found out I was obsessed with home made mustard.
It works great even when run for long periods (some mustard seeds must be processed for 6-8 minutes to reach proper grind).
It has plenty of power and has also now been put to use grinding romano cheese.
It's just a lot easier to use when I don't need the capacity of my 14 cup processor.
This happened after 4-5 years of regular use, though, it wasn't new by any stretch of the imagination.
In the end, though, I did just buy a new one.
This baby chops, dices, and is great for making emulsions for mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing.
The blade can be flipped over for different uses.
If you read the directions that come with the product, they explain clearly how to use the appliance so that you don't get onion mush.
Otherwise, it does exactly what it says it does.
I love this little appliance for chopping small amounts of food.
It replaced one that I had used for 16 years.
Once I figured how to put it together, it worked just fine.
My first project was to grind chicken to make burgers.
I sliced the breasts into long pieces and laid them on the blades.
No sooner had I turned it on low when the job was done! I went through 3 breasts in less than 3 minutes.
Too bad some others did not have such good luck.
I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors.
There is a possibility that the glass jar is not correctly placed on the base which could lead to accelerated wear of the plastic connectors.
This should not happen with a bit of care.
Only bit of criticism that I have is that the blender could be slightly faster and blend more foamy.
The glass is of excellent quality and very thick; I've banged it accidentally several times and there's not a scratch on it.
The top has a great grip when you close it.
The base is made of plastic and feels a little cheap.
I love my little blender!The color is the exact baby pink shown in pictures.
I mainly use mine to make my breakfast protein shakes in the morning and it blends up the fruit I put in like a champ.
In my humble opinion, most of blenders are not great.
The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit.
I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.
So if you are doing a lot of entertaining, you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.
You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down.
Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients.
Also, you should look at the recipe book.
I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill.
I use this for my diet shakes and it's the best.
I also love that it is very easy to clean.
I'd lower my number of stars, but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.
I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time, but I used it very rarely).
I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.
So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].
When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.
THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer, which doesn't have any plastic moving parts.
I chose this blender because I love the color pink.
It is a fair price for a blender that works well.
Those really didn't concern me since there were only a few of those.
The only thing that I would have wished for is a metal motor housing, instead of plastic.
I'll just have to be a little extra careful with it.
It's the sole reason I took off 1 star, but this is probably normal for modern, small appliances.
Unfortunately, almost nothing is made to last, any longer.
Planned obsolesence/replacement, so they can keep seling them, LOL.I'm more than pleased with my choice.
I love pink appliances and they are very hard to find.
This blender matches all my other pink appliances and is also a quality product.
I had a Cuisinart Duet before - which still works but it's not nearly as pretty as this pink one.
I'll have to use it more to see if it's really a great product.
This blender does a great job and is not to heavy or cumbersome.
It's easy to use and take apart for cleaning.
Not sure why all the bad reviews as we loved ours!  I am back to buy the 700 watt upgraded version of this blender.
It has lasted several years through almost daily smoothie making.
(Green smoothies are a family favorite!)I admit I never tried grinding up dry things or using it for many other purposes.
But for smoothies and mixed drinks it was perfect and durable!.
This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap.
I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder.
The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces.
Once it's throughly blended, like a shrimp bisque, it's a world class soup.
I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant.
I've had one can a day for twenty years.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick).
Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup, but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups.
This is a high quality blender that is made to last.
I have had many blenders over the past decade and this is by far the best.
Whether it is smoothies, pancake batter, shakes etc....it does a great job.
Worked great for the three months that it functioned.
I liked the glass jar and it made great smoothies.
It is made in China and of apparently poor quality.
Too expensive to buy one every three months.
However, it still broke after three months so you should be careful.
BOUGHT THIS ONE AFTER A PLASTIC CONTAINER ONE BUSTED IN MID STREAM AND BLEW OUT ALL OVER MY NEW KITCHEN AND NEW WINDOWS TOO.
I was very hesitant to purchase this product this past christmas after reading the reviews here on Amazon.
My mother had wanted one for awhile, but always thought they were well over $100.
It has been used almost every day since Christmas 2003, and they have not had one problem.
My parents loved it so much they bought another one.
My parents did that, but I can certainly see a lot of people getting lazy and not cleaning it every time.
My mother bought this for myself and my husband for xmess about 4 years ago.
You don't want to use soap in a coffee maker ever.
We use a kitchen scrub brush to rinse all the grounds off under the tap and then DRY THOROUGHLY before putting it back together.
Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.Complaints:Honestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.
Eventually even our tricks to bypass the quirks stopped working and we threw it out.
The quality of the coffee is unsurpassed by any other machine (save my pump espresso machine) and we love our coffee around here.
FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.
I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.
I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.
Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder, be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.
After buying this I went and got a kuring k-cup which is much nicer.
I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range.
I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts.
I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away.
just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils.
Assuming one has realistic expectations from such an inexpensive appliance, they will be very happy with this ice-cream maker.
Overall a great product.NOTE: For most of the recipes I've tried, this machine produces ice-cream of a consistency akin to soft serve.
Very tasty in any-case and things harden up nicely in the freezer if you have time to wait.
I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot.
Although it is super easy to use, it is not really a practical gadget for regular use.
The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance.
The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath.
Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors, dieters, or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar).
I usually make mango ice cream in it.
In addition to ice-cream, it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks.
In  that case you will want to get an extra canister.
Just saw this at Costco in Chicago for about 1/2 this price.
worth a trip to Costco if you have a membership.
I have had one of these for about 10 years.
How long this takes is dependent on how cold your freezer is inside.
I usually put mine in the night before I plan to use it.
It is easy to set up, use and clean.
It turns out a nice product - good enough to serve guests.
We like being able to have ice cream with less sugar and no chemicals.
My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago.
My husband and I are vegan, so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes.
(I eventually started compiling them in my blog, A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine.
Still, it's not too difficult, and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it.
We actually found this product on clearance sale at JCPennys last winter.
It will also have a more crystallized and less creamy texture.
I still need to try the frozen yogurt.
With the price of good ice cream these days, this quickly paid for itself because it's much cheaper to make our own.
This product works great, if the unit kept in the freezer for long enough, the consistency of the ice cream gets very good.
I bought an ice cream maker so I could use organic ingredients, and everything has turned out fantastic so far.
We've been using this for almost two years with no problems and are pleased with the design.
I bought this ice cream maker last summer and ended up not using it much because of time constraints.
When i first got my ice cream maker, 3 days ago, I cleaned and put it in the freezer.
After pouring the ingredients in the top I let it go for 25 min.
It was a hard icecream on the softer side of the spectrum.
Still so good!I can't wait to try another flavor, frozen yogurt, and eventually premium(hard, I'm guessing).
This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.
This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make "frozen ANYTHING" with this maker.
Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.
First let me start by saying I was a little skeptical of ice cream makers.
The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time, neither of which I have.
The ice cream is so good and really easy.
It makes the perfect amount for a family, not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.
Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream.
It is simple to use, and the results taste great!My only complaint is how loud the machine is.
I let my bowl freeze for at least two days before using it.
I try to stick to the lower fat recipes.
You can find endless recipes and ideas on the internet.
Yum!If you would like your own ice cream maker, you can't go wrong with this machine!.
I have had an old Donvier manual model for 30 years, so I'm used to using a chiller bowl.
However, there's no comparison between hand turning the paddle in the Donvier model and letting the Cuisinart do it's thing.
My ice cream is ready in about 12-13 minutes.
Love, love, love this Cuisinart.I debated on whether to get the 2 qt model or the 1 1/2.
I opted for the 1 1/2 qt and find that's plenty of ice cream.
As described, read all the reviews and decided to replace my leaking old Krupps with this one and do not regret the decision.
Next I will try the recipe for Nutella gelato or peach ice cream.
The grandkids love to help make and eat our creations.
I bought this product on the recommendation of my son to make cranberry ice for Thanksgiving.
I did everything that I expected it to do.
I'm the author of Lick It! Creamy Dreamy Vegan Ice Creams Your Mouth Will Love and this is the ice cream maker that I use.
It's easy to use, makes great ice cream, is fairly quiet.
I've had it for about 5 years and have made a LOT of ice cream with it and it's still going strong.
This is the same one as the 4qt.
ice cream maker that uses rock salt and ice, just larger.
(I know it's the same because the inlaws have the 4qt.
That's because I gave up with Rival after continued problems with my first two ice cream makers and ordered the Cuisinart from Amazon.
Is your icecream more of a milkshake than ice cream? I have some chef tips:1.Never put in chunky ingredients from the beginning.
They don't allow the butterfat to freeze correctly.
They need to be added at the end (chocolate chips, fruit, etc.)Soy milk? No problem.2.Never use imitation vanilla extract.
It contains propylene glycol which not only isn't as good as regular vanilla, it prevents milk and cream from freezing well.
If you add the ingredients first and then turn it on, the edges will freeze first to the bowl and your middle won't catch up.
The outside core is a very flimsy plastic.
This is so common that it says in the owner's manual that when it does this you need to stop it and move the ice.
This means you always need to be watching it during making.
Happens on both size models which is why I had to exchange this originally for the gel model at Wal-mart.
For some crazy reason, the paddle doesn't spin, the bowl does which means it makes the ice migrate and melt easily.
Rock salt should not go down your sink so we would also walk it outside to the street.
You don't want it in your yard either.
This means you ruin your mix and have to start over.
If you need more freezing time, you can just keep on going.
I love the Ben and Jerrys one because it's not just recipes, but goes into the science of making the perfect bowl too.
The Cuisinart has the nutritionals to every recipe, the Rival doesn't.
You probably don't want to see the calories of ice cream anyway.
Especially chocolate!WARRANTY:RE 1 yearRG 1 yearCA  3 yearsICE CREAM CONSISTENCY:RE: I was very disappointed in the Rival Electric.
It runs until it senses the outside edges are done but this left my inside ice cream edges not whipped.
Even on high butterfat ice cream recipes we had a perfect consistency so I fell in love with this one.
That was the main thing for me, to get a good whipped up ice cream.
Came without scratches, looks brand new! Look forward to using it soon.
Being diabetic I will be making my own sugar free ice cream and sorbet.
Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe.
Well, let me tell you -- we were all delighted.
Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!.
We've had this Cuisinart ice cream maker for several months now and have made many different flavors of ice cream.
I've read some earlier reviews where the reviewer had a problem with the ice cream being too soft.
When it is initially finished it is not as hard as when purchased in a store.
However, merely by placing in the freezer, where ice cream belongs in the first place, it hardens to regular consistency.
I have one of these and just love to make homemade ice cream in it rather than my ice and salt ice cream maker.
I do have to say you really need to plan ahead as the bowl requires a long time to freeze.
That being said, I would buy this again.
Firstly, I have to admit that I've never made ice cream in it.
My favorite?  Fresh grapefruit juice with sugar, fresh mint, and lime juice.
You can also use it to make somewhat more &quot;adult&quot; fare.
The only down side to this machine is that once you start making your own stuff, it's neigh on to impossible to stop.
On the other hand, since you're making it yourself and can limit what ingredients you use, the end result can be enormously healthy.
Blend away as you would if you were making a smoothie.
It helps with chilling the mixture faster while it is being churned.
Mine did not melt nor drip into the mixture.5) Put an empty glass container in the freezer before you start making the ice-cream mixture.
Turn on the ice-cream machine and pour the mixture in.
Once the mixture thickens and has a soft-serve or thicker consistency, turn off the machine.
It is easy to use, very fast and cleans like a dream.
I also like the fact it does not make a huge amount I have to store somewhere.
This is a great product for small families.
I make Raw Cream Ice Cream twice a week.
I add 6 Raw Free-Range Egg Yokes, a 1/4 cup of Maple Syrup, 2 1/2 tablespoons of Vanilla Extract and 1 tablespoon of Psyllium Husks.
I consider it medicine for my 3 year boy.I find that it does stick to the bowl some.
It's not a problem unless you put it back in the freezer with ice cream in it.
I only do that when I'm leaving soon after making ice cream.
It's not totally quiet, but what do you expect from a motor.
It's quieter than the old salt and ice type.
I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt.
I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt.
I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes.
It was louder then I anticipated, but nothing crazy.
I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams, sorbets, sherbets, frozen yogurts, and even frozen slushy drinks.
It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean.
I bought this for me last summer, and I loved it so much, I bought another as a gift.
It's easy, taste so much better than anything you can buy, and it's fun to be creative.
Great way to use up ripe bananas, and make banana split ice cream.
I've made 3 batches with my machine; here are my observations.
That second batch came out very, very good; in the freezer, it ended up freezing quite hard but smooth &amp; consistent.
So, I tried to find a way to keep it softer.
Simply insert the paddle, pour in the mix, attach the top, and start it up.
Of course, you can always take a sturdy non-metal utensil to it to sample it right away.
You'll have to let the bowl thaw some before hand-washing.
Fresh ice cream has never been easier.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann.
I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone.
I have made countless different recipes in it, and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes.
I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert.
An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!.
I really found this product to be wonderful, compared to others which I have used.
so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced.
I really like this and I ordered it for my son and wife as I love mine.
No mess and you have great home made ice cream in about 30 minutes.
When/if my ever breaks, I would buy another one on amazon PRONTO.
I most often don't follow a recipe but simply create my own.
I don't think I ever threw out any of my creations and I am very picky and do throw out other non-frozen recipes.
I think my secret is to taste it before freezing it; if you don't like it the taste unfrozen, you won't like it frozen!.
This works well, but there are a few points to make it a success.-First, make sure your freezer is cold.
Recommended food storage is halved for every 5 degrees above zero F.
At -10 you are golden for this unit.-Second, make sure you freeze the bowl for a long time.
24 hours should be enough.-Third, make sure your ingredients are cold.
Even if they are cool, it should be ok, but will be softer.Custard based recipes work great.
I'm amazed how many people have become so accustomed to artificial flavors and conditioners, that "real" doesn't taste right anymore.
The old style salt and ice can maintain temps well, and the expensive integrated freezer units are about perfect, but obviously cost more.
You can't fault it for being something it's not though.The dasher doesn't scrape the side of the bowl, it sits off just slightly.
This leaves a ring of frozen icy cream, not a smooth ice cream stuck to the side.
I think the newer version has a better dasher/scraper.I might try running it in the freezer on an extension cord.
The ice-cream maker seems to work perfectly fine.
I have to say though, I am still working on getting perfect, creamy ice-cream from it while using quality ingredients.
I made my first batch of ice cream today.I made the vanilla which was very easy;vanilla,milk,sugar and cream.
i gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it.
i still think this is the easiest one you will find and it's a big plus to not need ice or salt.
very easy to clean and there is an opening at the top so you can watch it work.
:happy dance: I made real ice cream with this little machine.
Also this helps my ice cream not come out too runny.
I transfer it to a container and put it in the freezer and it "ripens" and becomes harder consistency.
I just use the basic vanilla ice cream recipe and for the maple nut I added one cup of maple syrup but used less sugar.
I added walnut bits at the end of the cycle.
Oh there is no timer on this unit so you have to decide when the cycle of it churning should end.
So far everything has come out delicious, I freeze it in a separate container for the "real ice cream" consistency.
This machine works perfect for the price, the amount of work, etc., you cannot go wrong.
I have used this beauty for dessert 4 or 5 nights a week since getting it over a month ago.
I mix up the ingredients and put them in the refrigerator to thoroughly cool, then put the freezer together and pour it in.
10 to 20 minutes later, it's ready (depends on exact mix).
Obviously you have to be aware of that.
just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid.
leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.
Also, you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.
My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.
Other than that, its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.
If you really like ice cream or have a large family, you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.
I've had this ice-cream maker for nearly two years now and love it.
What Donvier started, Cuisinart perfected! There are a lot of great features to this machine.
The extra bowl also helps if I'm in a hurry and don't want to totally chill the mix.
Then I chill it almost to the freezing point in one and move it to the second one.
The biggest problem I have noticed is that relatively few people know how cold their freezer is (as well as their fridge).
So easy and fast - as well as fresh good ingredients have made possessing this machine a delight.
The 2nd reason is inappropriate ingredients that prevent the cream from freezing.
Some of these ingredients are anything with alcohol, fresh citrus fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, etc) and kiwi - amongst some others.
Seems to me that anything that will prevent jello from 'setting' will also prevent ice cream from freezing properly.
If you want it firmer or harder, put it into a different container and put it back in the freezer.
Now get creative and enjoy the fruits of your labors :).
I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.
I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk, condesed milk, and cocoa powder.
At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.
It didn't swish when I shook it, so I thought I was good to go.
After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.
I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.
After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.
I will never buy ice cream from the store again.
This ice cream maker is awesome, I love it.
I can tell you that after 8 years or so of owning this type of machine I made ice cream 3 times.
It was messy, clean up was a pain and it was noisy.
After my machine was ruined by a leaky roof (divine intervention) I looked around and decided to purchase the cuisinart ice cream machine.
Since owning this maching I have made ice cream atleast once a week.
I have even made ice cream to go with dessert for a dinner for 75 people.
Some of the reviewers mentioned noise, they must have never heard the noise produced by tradtional ice cream machines that have a motor.
It is about the level of a food processor or blender.
I keep the bowl in my freezer and chill the ice cream and sorbet mixtures well before pouring them into the machine to begin churning.
I highly recommend buying an extra bowl if you need to make more than 1 1/2 quarts at a time.
With my "old fashioned" ice cream machine (salt and water), they always recommended ripening the ice cream and I continue to do so.
Best of all, I did not break the bank to get good results.
Although I love the end results on some of the pricer ice cream machines, my Dr.
Pepper pockets could not come up with the Champagne cost of those $100.00 or more icecream makers.
I am unsure were the $90.00 original sticker price came from.
At the cuisinart site you can purchase the same machine for $49.95 just like here at Amazon.
All you have to do is mix the ice cream base, pour it in the machine and flip the switch!.
It takes a little practice to get used to what works and what doesn't with this Ice Cream Maker.
For the price though, it is really good.
I messed up my first few recipes by over filling the thing.
Eventually, I was making my own delicious ice creams and sorbets.
So much fun during the summer! My kids were thrilled! ;).
We are very happy with this ice cream maker.
We have no negative comments on this machine.
Some of the recipes in the booklet (and in other recipes online or in other books) might require some additional prep work.
The ice cream maker makes 1-1/2 quarts which is more than enough for my husband and I to enjoy.
It's quick, easy and contains less preservatives than store bought.The only issue I have with it is the mixing attachment is made of plastic.
It feels like it has to be handled very gingerly or it will snap in two.
At times I am concerned that I will make an ice cream that is too thick for it to handle.
I hope this thing last a long time so we can get many uses out of it.
This ice cream maker is easy to use, easy to clean and makes delicious ice cream.
However, in my neck of the woods, sometimes it is difficult to find decent frozen yogurt that is not filled with sweetners and other additives.
I was attracted to the high end ice cream  makers, but the cost was way too prohibitive for me.
No more store bought frozen yogurt for me!! I just invested in a bunch of different Sonoma Syrups (I used Meyer Lemon for this batch).
I froze the tub in my deep freezer for 48 hours.2.
My ingredients were cold when I added them.3.
I took the tub from the freezer, turned it on and immediately added the cold ingredients.
I did not allow any time for the tub to warm up.4.
We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make "Ice Cream" with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.
We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.
We have make banana and strawberry "ice cream" using soy milk and both have come out perfect.
The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.
We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.
We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first.
I BOUGHT THIS TO HELP ME MAKE DIET DESSERTS I COULD EAT ON A DIET.
WORKS WELL, NOT TOO NOISY, EASY TO CLEAN.
RECOMMEND BUYING EXTRA BOWL IF 1-1/2 QUARTS NOT ENOUGH, OTHERWISE HAVE TO WAIT 24 HOURS FOR BOWL TO RE-FREEZE.
This is the second one of these I've owned.
My first one is 3000 moles away at my parents house so I figured it would be cheaper to just buy another.
This makes good sorbets and ice creams (though depends on your own recipes to make them good, right?).
The freezer part is wonderful and will keep a freeze for a good hour or so.
Very simple design that is easy to clean.
This is the first ice cream maker I have purchased, and this seems to have been a good choice.
So far I have made dark chocolate gelato that came out fantastic, and some strawberry frozen yogurt.
After 25-30 minutes in the machine, the consistency and texture are quite good...definitely hard enough to eat immediately.
After having lived in Italy for a year, I really missed creamy Italian gelato, and so now I have my own way to make it.
And it's also nice because I know exactly what goes into every batch.
This machine is pretty loud, but nothing too unbearable.
I would recommend it for anyone interested in a small, easy to clean, easy to use, ice cream maker.
I have made sorbets and various full and low fat ice creams.
It is easy to use if you follow the directions and easy to clean.
It makes a product that is frozen but not hard.
We store the frozen bowl in the freezer with the bottom side down, it seems to get things a little firmer this way.
Clean-up is a breeze as there are only three parts to clean.
I just go to the market, see what looks freshest , and it's sorbet within a few hours.
Ice creams almost as easy and much better than Steve's, Baskin Robbins, etc.
I can't say enough about this little unit that looks like nothing.
It's sure something!  And at less than $50, it's a bargain.
I have wanted one of these for a long time but the price was too high.
Costco finally started carrying them for around $30, so I decided I wasn't out much if I didn't like it.Works great.
I love homemade ice cream but it is such a pain to make, especially since I am single.
The ice cream freezes great if you use an airtight bowl and still tastes freshly made.
Stays pretty soft as well, almost like having tasty soft serve ice cream.
They call for whole milk and heavy cream.
Atkins &quot;diet&quot; ice cream (egg custard sweetened with artificial sweetner) and was surprised how well it worked.
The ice cream custard was cooled to room temp and I used a dairy thermometer to measure the temperature.
Chilling the custard would have resulted in an even firmer mass, but I was impatient.
Ok, I am one who will pour through hundreds of reviews before making a purchase.
Did I mention I ADORE ice cream??I finally bought this machine.
My husband thought I was crazy and that I'd never use it.
I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container.
I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously.
It's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made.
It's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it's whirring around, especially the first batch.
My daughter bought this item for me and I have used it so much.
It is so easy to use  and it makes delicious ice cream.
I will not rehash what everyone else has said, but this ice cream maker is everything I could ask for.
It makes ice cream and other frozen treats super fast, is easy to clean, compact, and not too loud.
Sure, it's not whisper quiet, but I didn't think the noise level was unbearable and conversation is easy to hear over it.
Cuisinart appliances have always seemed to be reliable so let's hope this one is no exception.
I already had one and liked it very very much.
It is easy to use and the product is great.
The red choice made it an even more fun gift.
Keep them clean and wrapped in the freezer.
Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker.
It's so easy and the results are amazing.
I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream.
It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find.
Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream.
I've made mint chip, premium vanilla bean and strawberry.
I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream).
I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!.
This is such a great little ice cream maker.
I've used it countless times since I got it for Christmas two years ago.
Many of the highest rated ones had eggs as an ingredient.
Now we were getting somewhere - eggs add a lot of flavor if you do it right.
So, I made up my own recipe for my first batch of chocolate ice cream.
Oh! My! Gosh!  I have never, ever, ever, had ice cream that tasted so good.
My husband actually complained that he could only eat a small bowl because it was so rich.
By rich, I mean a deep chocolately flavor - sweet, but not too sweet.
My next recipe I tried (and made up) was Butter Pecan.
My husband loves it - because he can eat more of it (it's not rich at all).
Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.
Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.
Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.
Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.
Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.
Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.
Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.In a small skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter and add pecans.
Salt the pecans and stir constantly for several minutes to "roast" the nuts.
I'm also not concerned about salmonella from these.
I don't separate the eggs, and if you do it right, there's no need.
Very easy to use and clean and good basic recipes included in the appliance's booklet.
If you want a lighter ice cream that doesn't have such a fatty aftertaste, however, try 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.
I wish Cuisinart would include some vegan options using almond and coconut milk, too.
Just had our first batch of ice cream from this product.
Easy to use, great end results and fun.
My husband couldn't tell the difference between this ice cream and the store bought kinds.
I would highly recommend this to anyone for ease of use and cleanup.
This is a very simple machine that does what it's supposed to with very little fuss.
I put the frozen bowl part in our upright freezer at least a few hours before I expect to make ice cream.
I make the custard for the ice cream at the same time.
After dinner, I put the frozen part on the stand, put in the mixing blade and top with the lid.
Then I pour the custard in and 20-30 minutes later we enjoy fresh ice cream with no additives.
If you want ice cream that is harder than soft serve, it will need to "ripen" a bit more in your freezer.
But this is a delightful machine that I highly recommend.
I never made ice cream before it, and never want to buy it from a grocery again.
This product is getting great reviews for good reason.
Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way.
Second, chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled.
In not doing these things, I've found that I create milkshakes, and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants.
To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie.
Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly, and I'll experiment with those recipes.
The fruit of this labor has been enjoyed by family and friends who are so glad I went into sharing ice cream.
This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours.
I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours.
At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture.
At 12 hours, I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen.
It also makes GOOD ice cream - I haven't had a complaint yet! Highly recommend!.
When first made, the ice cream is about the consistency of soft serve or a Wendy's Frosty.
That's just fine with me, the flavor is best this way.
After freezing whatever is left of the batch, the consistency is like store bought ice cream.
I do not do anything fancy with it, just follow the directions in the included booklet for basic vanilla ice cream.
Otherwise the ice cream will be real runny.
I try to freeze it for 24 hours before use.
As long as the directions are followed on this machine, it makes great ice cream every time.
This is by far my most used kitchen gadget.
Love it! Am going to buy another one as a gift right now.
I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.
It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.
I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.
I saw some people complained of the noise, but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.
Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.
[...]  I am very happy with this purchase.
It works best if you make sure that the bowl is 100% frozen solid, which means leaving it in the freezer at least overnight.
Also once you've made your mix, put that in the freezer too for a little while so it's very cold.
I bought this ice cream maker after I took an Ice Cream, Gelato and Sorbet class at Sur La Table cooking store.
Because we were making so many different types of desserts, we had several ice cream makers working in the classroom at the same time.
The bowl froze easily (probably in less than 24 hours) in the bottom and back of the freezer.
I originally thought I'd seldom use it, but it's very easy to use and turns out great tasting results!I have no complaints.
The recipe book included with the unit has great basic ideas (I especially enjoy the Coffee Ice Cream, I add toffee to mine).
From there, the possibilities are endless!If you can measure, you can make ice cream.
The noise reminds me to keep checking my ice cream to see if it's "done".
great price, good ice cream, you can't go wrong with this!.
I've made vanilla, strawberry (using fresh strawberries) and chocolate ice cream in this machine and it was all yummy.
I just used the recipes that came with the machine.
Each batch consistently took 25 minutes to make.
It's easy to use and easy to clean.
I bought the red unit which adds a fun color to my kitchen when not in use.
The opening at the top is also convenient for scooping up a spoonful of ice cream for tasting without turning the unit off.
I love how simple and easy it is to use.
But I just make a batch early before dinner and store it in the freezer while we're eating.
I bought this machine for my husband following the recommendations here.
Consequently I also bought him the extra freezing container and two books of recipes,one being the Ben and Jerry's book.
So far he has produced several excellent batches of ice cream.
We are delighted and impressed! It's so easy and so much fun!.
Lets start by saying I hate gadjets, took me years to buy a food processor.
But my sister is on chemo, and I found out she dislikes the taste of commercial ice cream, even the expensive stuff.
They both get a lot of use and get high marks all around!.
This is our 2nd Cuisinart ice cream maker.
This is just as easy as running to the store and buying a carton of additive-packed ice cream.
Freeze the bowl, mix your ingredients, fire it up, add your mixture, blend-blend-blend, ice cream.
The owner's manual comes with many recipes and with sites like Pinterest I have discovered many more.
One of my favorites is 1 cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate, 3 cups milk, and 3 tbsp Splenda for a tangy frozen treat.
A tip: do not use a metal sppon to scrape the bowl, it will leave unsightly scratch marks.
Hopefully I did not ruin my bowl by doing that.
If you want to wow your dinner guests, whip up a batch of the strawberry sorbet.
I purchased this item from another online retailer and bought it refurbished.
It works terrific and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.
Also, I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.
Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.
We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night.
I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go.
I really like how fast it makes ice cream.
I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out.
Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl.
So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream.
The texture is just right when its finished.
I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer.
So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy.
i gave it to my sister after gaining a few pounds of making delicioso ice cream for one summer.
this machine works and it is inexpensive and its awesome to be able to make ice cream in my own home.
I will get an updated model of this next summer (after i workout intensely for 3 months).
I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year.
It was a great price, and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of.
I really was not expecting the quality of product I received in the Cuisinart ICE-20R Ice Cream Maker.
I was buying on the name recognition only, best price, and expected a glorified toy.
But, this little machine is not only cute.
it is EASY to use and delivers! It's truly a professional kitchen appliance that works like a charm!  In addition, it is easy to use.
25 minutes later you're eating the real deal.
From chocolate candy cane, to cinnamon apple crumble, to avocado (yes!) - this ice cream maker helped my vegan ice cream dreams come true.
With better side-scrapers or some kind of middle-freeze-chamber - it could be better.
Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat.
All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly.
I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.
no.I would recommend this product and purchase again.
Without a doubt, this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift, but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).
It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.
Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.
Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it, then improvise.We are healthy eaters.
It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.
It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!.
The savings over store bought ice cream is phenomenal too.
I only have one small exception to our "eye blasting red" ice cream maker (and it is indeed a small exception).
It could be perhaps be a bit quieter.
I bought this for my elderly mother and she loves it!  It's working wonderfuly and making some fantastic ice cream.
She can see it make the ice cream from the top.
I'm sure it would be fun for kids to watch as well.
Take some chocolate milk, cool whip and eagle brand milk.
25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.
It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.
I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.
No salt to rinse out, no ice - just some great, smooth, wonderful ice cream.
After ice cream is made, you just rinse the bowl with hot water, dry and return to the freezer for the next time.
The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.
The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.
I have had my ice cream maker for appr.
one month and I could not be happier so far.
One of the best things about homemade ice cream and ice is that they seem to encourage people to join in making them.
You see, the chemistry of freezing foods has its own set of built-in limits.
Since you'll be serving it right away, you can stop the machine whenever the mixture looks right.
I have purchased this ice-cream maker refurbished from Amazon.com and it works great.
It is very quiet (a bit louder than your average microwave) and doesn't take up much counter space.
However, it is definitely not for impulse ice-cream eaters.
The recipes are by no means plentiful but offer an idea how to make good ice-cream.
So if you like your ice-cream vey solid, you are probably better off just getting a pint of Ben & Jerry's.
I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop.
I was worried it might be loud after reading a review, but it is NOT - not at all.
We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great.
The only thing is, I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says, because it was quite sweet.
The sorbet was yummy and fresh, and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away.
Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream, and it was delicious.
It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish.
I probably only use it about 3-4 times a year, but I could not do without it.
I just finished making Nigella Lawson's (Food TV) Margarita ice cream.
If you have any doubts about an ice cream maker, get that recipe and try it, you'll be glad you got the ice cream machine.
Again, I recommend the Ben & Jerry's ice cream recipe book to go with it!------------------------------I never knew ice cream could be so easy.
Someone at work shared his Ben & Jerry's book with me, which inspired me to get the ice cream maker.
Because of the price and fat in heavy whipping cream, I use part half and half.
And another colleague at work suggested using 1/4 cup or so of Dream Whip for smoothness.
Jury still out on that one.But it's all good.
If you don't have one yet, hurry!  Before summer gets here and you really want a delicious bowl of homemake ice cream!.
Works great...6 cups is perfect for husband and I, never been sorry for purchase.
I just received this yesterday, and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.
I was a little apprehensive, since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.
We've been using our old electric rock salt machine, but now we'll probably get rid of it.
Also, due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker, we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.
The key to this maker is the cylinder which has walls filled with anti-freeze.
If you have any inclination to make your own ice cream, this is the machine to have, in my humble opinion.
The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid.
About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple.
Also, by the way, it's the best ice cream you'll ever have.
Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry.
Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours.
It comes out great, I have very little problem with ice crystals forming.
I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften.
And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream won't freeze - just gets thick.
But it's a great item, and doesn't take up much space on the counter.
I'm especially happy with it since I can't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance.
So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it's very satisfactory!.
I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit.
No mess, quick, easy, home made ice cream.
Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted.
Great for frozen drinks, too, including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction, powerful motor.
The best and fastest way to make excellent ice cream and sorbet.
Wonderful product!!!!!!!!!Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White.
You simple mix-up the ingredients, chill, and then pour into the  pre-frozen bowl.
I highly recommend the book,  &quot;Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream, Sorbetti &amp; Granite&quot; by Pamela  Sheldon Johns as a great add-on.
I ordered the book with the hope of being  able to duplicate the Stracciatella(?) Gelato I had while on vacation in  Italy.
The recipe was simple (heavy cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and  shaved chocolate) and the results were fabulous.This machine would  make a great gift as well!.
The batch is enough for a family, well assuming everybody get a regular size cup.
You have to freeze the container for a day, but it is an unexpensive machine compare to those freezer units which cost a lot more.
I bought mine at bed, bath & beyond for $ 40.00.
I would buy this product again & again.
I picked this up at the start of summer.
i've made quite a few batches of ice cream.
My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book.
There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream.
Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients.
Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in.
I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting.
This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller.
Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream.
This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container.
IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine.
I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm.
Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter.
A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream.
The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer.
This keep the frost out and improves taste.
Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters.
These have the least water and will have the best texture.
I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end.
Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc.
This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture.
They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream.
Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky.
You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day.
I also know of some machines that have a reverse function.
Haven't bought ice cream from the store since.
In a cooking class, I shared a table with a lady who regaled me with all the different flavors of ice cream she experimented with.
That idea appealed to me so that I went straight to Amazon and bought my first ice cream maker.
Just two days ago, my Cuisanart Ice Cream Maker (1 1/2 quart) arrived and the freezer bowl went straight into the freezer.
This ice cream maker is very easy to use and comes with very clear instructions.
I discovered that you must follow the instructions exactly.
If that sequence is not followed the lid won't fit properly.
I have make five pint batches of ice cream in seven days and couldn't be happier with this maker.
This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome, some good, some didn't work.
The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so, which I found strange.
An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy, but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks.
Overall, for $60, it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!.
I purchased this ice cream maker so that my husband and I can enjoy low or no carb ice cream.
It makes the best ice cream, easy clean up.
After that first fiasco, my homemade ice cream has been yummy!.
Use your favorite soda to make great slushies.
My kids love it!!!!You could even use Lemonade flavored with sugar or for adults frozen Marguarita's.
This machine makes ice-cream making SO much fun.
A little noisy, but similar to most ice cream machines...except makes fresh ice cream in 20-30 minutes!.
We run the ice cream maker for 30 min.
It makes a nice soft serve ice cream, if you want it firmer put it in a container the freezer.
I was impressed with the sale price, so I bought this on a whim.
An ice cream maker rookie, I was rather skeptical by the ease-of-use claims.
That's it.Notes:- The instruction book contains a few basic recipies, including vanilla ice cream and sherbet, to get you started.
This is helpful if you want to make a batch right away.- Watch the proportions in the recipies, as they are not exact.
You may want to taste your mixture before putting it into the machine.
As such, small children (with your supervision) can use this to try out their cooking skills.Enjoy!.
As soon as it arrived, I cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer, and checked the parts.
Sure, it's a bit plasticky, but that's okay with me.
Then found a recipe for sorbet, made the base and put it in the fridge.
That's why I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is.
I talked to my son on my cell phone right next to it while it was running, and I had no problem hearing him.
When I was finished, my mixture had the texture of a thick milkshake, so I popped it in the freezer and it hardened right up.
After 20 minutes, the bucket was still very cold even though it was over 80 in the house.So far, so good.
I'm very happy with my ice cream maker, and look forward to a summer of icy treats :).
I ordered this RED ice cream maker to give to my husband's daughter and family for Christmas along with a RED quesadilla maker.
I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are.
It's the perfect size for my husband and me.
Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.
IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things, like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.
I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.
We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something.
Hard to stay on a diet with this on the counter.
Lots of great recipes and the ice cream and sorbet are yummy!.
I did tons of online research and hands down, THIS machine got top ratings no matter what site I visited.
Some places offer a 2nd bowl for an additional price but I knew I wouldn't need that much ice cream.
Try using a high quality buttermilk for 1 cup of the liquid; it's low calorie and adds a nice twang to the end result.
Yes, upfront I'll say it's a little noisy, but that kind of goes with the territory.
Works perfectly, just as described in the directions.
I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.
It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.
Makes great ice cream, ice milk, bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.
I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.
Once you do that you may never make it any other way.
I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.
3 were from the manual that came with the machine, and one was from the internet.
All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.
The ice cream was not creamy and melty, it was either icy or fudgy.
I like the machine, it is easy to use, but also quite loud.
We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.
The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream, but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it.
I have wanted one of these machines for two years.
I finally got a great deal on it at Amazon, and snapped it up.
It says that you can freeze it for 6-22 hours, or until you shake the bowl and can't hear any liquid sloshing around.
So, I froze the bowl for 6 hours and sure enough, no sloshing.
But, this is simply not enough! My strawberry ice cream tasted wonderful, but in the machine never made it past a thick liquid stage.
I had to put it in the freezer for hours to get it hard enough to eat.
I've had one for a few weeks now, and many of the positive points of this unit have been mentioned in other reviews.
The &quot;premium chocolate&quot; is like eating a frozen truffle.
we enjoyed it, but it might be too bittersweet for kids.
The sherbets are under-flavored, and the frozen yogurt is extremely yogurty and unlike what you buy commercially.
Fortunately, you don't have to use their recipe.
I highly recommend Alton Brown's &quot;burned peach&quot; ice cream.
a quick google should find it at food.com.
After several failed attempts, I began to wonder if I would ever be able to make creamy dreamy ice cream at home.
Finally, I ordered the right one!  This ice cream maker really does work.
The only time it will not work is if your freezer is not set to the coldest setting.
I also found the extra freezer bowl to be indispensable.
This drastically speeds up the process.I also use the freezer bowl for other items I want to cool down quickly.
I use it to cool down Jello when making a Raspberry Mousse.
I have been known to place the whole contraption right into the freezer.
I also disobey the instructions and let the ice cream freeze until solid in the ice cream freezer bowl.
I found it just works faster that way.
That way your ice cream is ready in 40 minutes!  Yes, it takes 20-30 minutes and then 10 more minutes in the freezer.
At least that is how it goes in my kitchen.
If you start the ice cream before dinner, you won't even notice the time.Here is a favorite recipe for a slushy.
Heat honey in the microwave and stir into juice.2.
Pour in juice, freeze 10 minutes or until slushy.
Serve in tall glasses with straws.Makes 4 glasses~The Rebecca Review.
My bowl was super cold (overnight, lowest freezer setting) and it got to the "soft serve" stage fairly quickly.
My mistake was that I left it going too long, hoping it would get firmer.
We've had a lot of fun and good eating from this machine.
With a little tweaking of the recipes it turns out a really nice product.The ice cream produced is best if eaten fresh.
After it has been in the freezer it becomes a bit too crystalline for my taste.
This may mean cutting recipes in half but still works fine.
This is a very good model for making sorbets and ice cream.
It costs more to make ice cream at home than if you buy Hagan-Daaz in the store.
But, if you really like to make your own concoction, than this is really great.
Also, the insert will take up some room in your freezer and takes time to ice up.
then it started not working and i realized because it is not forgiving.
you must make sure the custard mixture is thick enough and that it is cooled properly and that the freezer bowl is properly frozen.
it makes great ice cream when you follow the instructions carefully.
Makes ice cream! I am on a no carb diet.
but I didn't want to give up my favorite frozen treat.
the ice cream holder itself requires about 24hrs to freeze prior to use.
You can of course use it before 24 hours.
which is also fine  :)I have never used an ice cream maker before this one.
he said this one is A LOT quieter.I love it.
We were somewhat skeptical about how the machine would work but were pleasantly surprised.
It is simple to use, with complete instructions and recipes.
And it makes wonderful ice cream in minutes.
Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.
So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.
But, i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.
and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.
We are real happy with this for sure.
We tried recipes out of the booklet that came with it, the Ben & Jerry's book and another source.
Something along the line of what we could pick up at the local convenience store.
Then we tried the recipe out of Christopher Kimball's The Desert Bible.
Hallelujah!  Creamy, rich, just what we had hoped for.We had a similar experience with our bread machine.
Mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook.
The fault may lie in the recipe book.
A lot.The Cuisinart Ice 20 Ice Cream Maker enables us to have ice cream with only a half hour's notice.
Is this good or bad?Good, I say! Lick the beater, the cylinder and your bowl kind of good.
That does not mean we eat only Hagen Daas quality stuff (well.
we actually do), but that we could keep a small ice cream shop in business with just our family.
Counting relatives, we could support a chain of such shops.We eat a lot of ice cream and we like a variety of flavors.
SEND THAT IN TOOT-SWEET! This little appliance comes with a 3-year manufacturer's warranty on defects.
Not a shabby deal in the least.Each piece is wrapped carefully in plastic bags, which I suggest saving, too.
Use these to wrap the freezer bowl while preparing it for use.
It does not offer a compressor in order to chill the product as you go.
This keeps that "freezer taste" from getting into your frozen product-to-be.
Use that handy bag that came with the unit, or use a plastic grocery bag to enclose the bowl.
Place it in the freezer and close the door.
For extra-fast chilling, put a bag of frozen vegetables inside the bowl.My bowl freezes in my refrigerator freezer in 8 hours.
No sloshing, or your ice cream won't "ice".
I hear tell it can take much longer for some folks' bowls to freeze, but check your freezer setting.
The methods remain similar, and if you have frozen the bowl you're more than half way there.Come Along with Me.
It's really that quick.Plug in the machine and press "on".
The motor will rotate the freezer bowl and the dome lid will hold the churn in place.
Pretty simple!Carefully pour in your ice cream base and leave the room for 20 minutes or so.
I dare you to try.You won't be able to do it because you won't believe you're making ice cream right there in your own kitchen.
And, you'll want to appoint yourself "Chief Taste-Tester", as you won't want any family, friends or acquaintances to suffer at all.
You're selfless, just as I am!The dome lid offers an opening in the center through which to add ingredients, and I use it to "sample".
Just be careful you don't lose a spoon in there.
Just pop the bowl back in the freezer, covered, for about an hour or less, depending.
I can keep it running as little or as long as I like, but 25 minutes has been the longest running time in my experience.
After that, we're eating ice cream!As for noise, it's tolerable.
I find the Ice-20 to be much quieter than a blender, and only slightly noisier than most dishwashers.
If you need more than that amount it's simple to prepare batches ahead of schedule and freeze them.
It's also possible to order an extra freezer bowl, which I did.
The cord is about 2-1/2 feet long which is plenty for counter top use.
Mine lives on a shelf inside my basement door.
It would fit inside a cupboard, too, if I had a place there.
You could also keep it on the counter top ...And, again, it couldn't be easier to clean.
All the components, aside from the freezer bowl, need only a wipe-down with a damp cloth.
Cool, calm, collected and concise, too.They'll not believe it, I assure you.
They'll want your secret, and it's up to you whether or not to tell them.Share the joy, won't you?.
We use this machine quite a lot during the summer.
It is awesome for ice cream, sorbet and slushy mixed adult beverages....mmmmmm.....can't wait for summer again!.
This is a delightfully easy way to make ice cream that tastes the way you want it to.
Want a flavor no one sells?  Mix it yourself with this easy-to-use machine.
The recipes in the instruction book work just fine.A bit of advice;1)Read the instructions carefully.2)Plan for some lead time.
You need to have the bowl completely frozen.
I bought this because my son was diagnosed with a dairy allergy.
I wanted to be able to provide ice cream without breaking the bank.
There are new coconut milk ice creams available but at $6 a pint I could pay for this unit in a hurry.
I buy my Thai brand Coconut Milk (not lite) from Walmart at $1.42 per can.
1/2 hour later I had what looked like soft serve ice cream.
Our first batch of ice cream didn't turn out so well.
The small batch is plenty for 2 large servings or 4 small ones, so there's never any leftovers.
During the holidays we added a touch of Baileys which was amazing.
We did try a fresh squeezed orange sorbet as well but found it really needed a lot of sugar to cut the acidity.
I'd probably just try frozen juice concentrate next time.Be sure to keep the instruction book!  There are lots of ideas and recipes inside.
I'm looking forward to trying the fresh basil and lemon sorbet this summer.
Overall, for the price you pay and the simplicity of the device, it was a smart investment for our kitchen.
We generally spend about $10 in ice cream every other week during the summer, so this maker has already paid for itself!.
Keep one in the freezer at all times and you are never caught without one that is ready to go!.
My daughter-in-law wanted this for so long to make fresh sorbet, I bought it as a gift for her.
She has already made watermelon sorbet and it came out great.
If you buy this I recommend buying the extra canister so you can leave it in te freezer and always be ready.
I've only used this once so far, but it's pretty awesome.
You just pour in your pre-mixed, chilled ingredients, press start, and set a kitchen timer.
My only complaint is that it's a little noisy.
I wouldn't recommend running it while you're trying to watch a movie or something.
I'm looking forward to using this more when the weather warms up here in Michigan.
This is very easy to use; it's just like another small appliance you can use on your counter top.
It still works great, and I've been able to experiment more.
Even if I don't get the recipie just right, it freezes just fine.
I use frozen berries to make sorbets with less sugar (high fructose corn syrup) than the grocery store kinds.
I've also made a batch of very rich vanilla (with eggs carefully cooked) and it came out wonderful.
It's fast, easy to clean, and makes plenty for left-overs.
I put this ice cream maker on my Amazon.com wish list, and my sweet daughter sent it to me for my birthday.
:)I just made my first batch of ice cream today.
I'm very pleased with both the machine's performance and the taste/texture of the ice cream.
It's not whisper quiet, but it's not nearly as noisy as my Cuisinart blender.
I bought this maker after reading reviews on forums.
I use it to make non-dairy ice cream with Vances Dari-Free which is a powdered milk substitute made from potatoes.
It works absolutely brilliantly and for the first time in a decade I actually had 'ice cream'.
With Vances you must pre-make the ice cream mix in a pot and heat it.
The mix must be allowed to cool in fridge for a few hours.
Then simply place it in the Cuisinart and turn on.
In a half hour you end up with a soft serve ice cream that tastes just like the real thing.
Not to mention the mess with the salt and ice.
This little maker doesn't make so much noise, no mess,  and it only takes 20 to 25 minutes to have firm ice cream.
Transfer the ice cream into a container and place it in your freezer if you want solid as a rock ice cream.
With the traditional freezers, you had to wait until you had a crowd to serve before you went to all that trouble.
This makes one and one half quarts, which is just enough for one starving person, or six normal people.
It comes with a recipe book and you can find tons of recipes on the web.
This is a very nice ice cream maker.
It is easy to use, easy to store and easy to clean.
This is my second summer using the Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1 1/2-Quart Ice Cream Maker, and it's never let me down.
Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite.
As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home, when the ice cream is done, it will.
still be soft, but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable.
I purchased this model about 3 years ago.
I have never been disappointed with the results.
This one is easy to use and it works.
I did freeze the ice cream for an additional 2 hours after it was mixed as the manual suggests.
Yumm  It doesn't make a lot, just a little over two pints.
It comes with a handy little recipe book to help you with your first few recipes.
You will be making home made ice cream in  about 20 minutes.
The consistancy is good, and it is delicous.
Best of  all, you will not be adding any strange presevatives, or anything you do  not want.
I got one of these ice cream makers as a Christmas gift, and it's been fantastic.
I was careful before requesting it to check the temperature of my freezer.
If your freezer doesn't maintain a temperature of between 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit, your ice cream probably won't turn out that well.
Mine stays at a chilly zero degrees, and I've been amazed at how quickly this machine makes great frozen desserts.
I keep the bowl in the freezer, wrapped in a plastic bag and filled with frozen vegetables, so it's always ready to go.
I bought this for my son for his birthday.
Thank goodness my son lives 1000 miles away or I would be in real trouble with this little machine.
The price is good and the ice cream is wonderful.
I had soft serve ice cream in about 25 min's after following the easy instructions.
If you love Ice Cream, you will love this ice cream maker.
I just got this machine and made the strawberry ice cream recipe that came with it.
This is so easy there's no reason to ever eat store bought ice cream again.
No locust bean gum, no artificial color, no preservatives - and you can make it with organic ingredients if you want.
This was the easiest ice cream I've ever made.
They enjoyed being able to see it iwhile the ice cream was making.
My machine didn't work the first two attempts.
I tried two different recipes - I was very disappointed.
2)Container needs to be really frozen - don't put in a cramped freezer, allow space around container so it freezes throughly all around container.
I am on a roll now though and look forward to making many more favors.
I love homemade ice cream, but have not had luck with the traditional ice cream freezers where you add ice and rock salt.
Though less expensive, they are less consistant.The Cuisinart ice cream maker is the opposite.
This handy contraption soft freezes your ingredients in a mere 20 - 30 minutes and is simple to use.
Simply freeze the canister ahead of time, add frozen canister to top of plastic base, add ingredients and turn on!Consistant results every time.
The recipe book included with the machine is very good, and all of the recipes are easy to follow and are delicious.
Some recipes are no cook Philadelphia Style (only cream, sugar and flavorings) though most are custard style (involving cooking the ingredients and adding eggs).
Its definately a must for those who like fresh homemade desserts.
I picked this up when I read some great reviews and I am very pleased.
Great product - Cuisinart never lets me down!.
It's easier to use than any other ice cream maker I've ever owned.
However, there are a couple of things to remember or you're going to be very frustrated by the experience.
First off, the freezer bowl has to be frozen solid.
I suggest you leave the bowl in your freezer for two days just to make sure it's cold enough.
Be sure your ingredients are very cold, too.
I use condensed and/or evaporated milk in a couple of my recipes and a day or two in the refrigerator is really important.
And the thicker the better with this machine.
A custard base is an excellent way to start.Next, don't dawdle.
It begins to thaw pretty quickly, especially in hot weather.
Most of it is just remembering to get things to the right temperature.
This isn't a big, fancy freezing unit, it's a relatively inexpensive way to make your own ice cream at home.
You're going to have to make some adjustments.
This is fun with the kid but a bit messy.
I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THIS CUISINART ICE-20 ICE CREAM, YORGURT, SORBET, MAKER.
IT'SMADE EXCELLENT COCONUT ICE CREAM, AND RASBERRY SORBET.
CUISINART,PUTS OUT A GREAT PRODUCT, AND THE SELLER WAS VERY REASONABLE ON HIS PRICE.
This item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase.
I like it very much and am VERY glad I ordered it.
Thank you so much Amazon.com for the great price, good value and prompt delivery.
I've just gotten this machine and have made the basic vanilla ice cream twice.
It was facinating watching it thicken up for the final result.
Time in the freezer is usually needed after it's done.
I highly recommend this machine!!  I know that we'll be having home made ice cream a lot more often now!.
Works great; there's nothing like home made ice cream and to have it within minutes with so little effort is a miracle.
If you store the tub in the freezer you can almost decide to have ice cream and satisfy that desire immediately.
We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle.
use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit.
When buying the Cuisinart ice cream maker, I really wasn't sure I'd use it, as I rarely eat ice creams.
It's extremely easy to use and cleans very easily.Few notes for better results:1) The bowl must be *frozen*.
While milk can be used, cream results in a much richer, thicker, tastier ice cream.
It stores very well, lasting for a couple of weeks without crystalizing.
I would use mine every day if I could remember to buy cream!.
I purchased this ice cream maker after reading all of the reviews.
I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to purchase an ice cream maker.
I would order from them again with confidence in their promise.
The 4&#34; flex tubing fit perfectly over this fitting for my woodshop dust system.
I'd give it 5 stars, but I had to remove with a Dremel some casting slag from the interior.
I use these in my overhead flexible four inch system for dust control.
The system is attached to an Oneida 1&1/2 hp  system which pretty much covers my small shop.
The marking holes and slots on this protractor are great.
I have used protractors before but had to always eyeball the markings with various degrees of accuracy.
A bonus is that a .5mm mechanical pencil came in the package too.
It is just the right diameter to fit in all of the holes and slots.The T-bar is a good feature also.
You can loosen the thumb screws to slide the T-bar off of the protractor.
Its Incra, its accurate, it is well made.
You need your trifocals for the angle indexes and a sharp pencil , but it is dead on.
I have used the T-rule so much, I decided to get this as well.
These rules are very accurate, and easy to use.
Use a 5mm lead mechanical pencil, and store the rule carefully.
Do buy another mechanical pencil to supplement the one/ones Incra provides.
They aren't great and you won't be happy when you can't get it unjammed while in the middle of a project.
A .5mm pencil will work but a .3mm engineering pencil is perfect.
My husband is very hard to buy for.
The previous two years, he opened his gifts then set them aside.
One he loaned to a friend! This and the other Incra item I purchased for him...he was very impressed.
The whole line of Incra products are fantastic and the marking protractor is no exception.
I like how the aluminum edge stop at the bottom is easily removable with two thumb screws.
It has many different indexed cutouts for precise marking.
Great timer, quality seems to be much better than the other brands I bought over the past few years.
Right now I am using the timer to turn on and off Christmas lights and it seems to be pretty dependable.
Probably will purchase more of these timers in the future.
This item works as expected and shows no signs of problems controlling audio/video gear.
I am happy with it as I always am.
I use one on my cat's drinking fountain.
I use the others on lights in the house.
It is best for when I am gone on a trip.
We bought this AC timer to use in conjuction with a heated pet bed for a crate on our back porch.
It worked all last winter and it is still working.
I use the TN311C heavy-duty grounded timer to control the ON-OFF cycle of a dehumidifier.
This gives me 6 ON-OFF cycles, and it works perfectly with our dehumidifier.
I've set the timer to turn ON the dehumidifier for 2 hours and then OFF for 2 hours throughout the day and night.
Not a big deal but works really well.
I use the timer to turn lamps on in the house so that when we come home there is light in the house.
I own several of these and appreciate the fact that it is 3-prong rather than 2-prong.
I've yet to find a timer with such simplicity and easy adjustment.
Never had one fail on me even when running at rated capacity.
Have used this for several years now for the Christmas decor.
Aquarium light go on and off each day.
It does it's job very well.It is connected to my wall a/c and to my attic fans.It runs well, no problems, i like it.
I'd had these timers for years and had no problems, so the issue is not with the timer itself.
This is a nice window fan with good power and not too noisy, adaptable to different window sizes if you need to move it.
It is nearly silent on the "low" settings, but when you set it on "high," it moves a LOT of air.
If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously.
It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move.
But, so far, so good!-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting.
It does have a few issues, but I can put up with them for how well it works.
It seems a bit flimsy, but once mounted it is relatively solid.
It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.
The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws, so it is removable.
The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.
If it bothers you, put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.
The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed.
The noise goes away on high speed, which is how we run it anyway.
I was looking for a fan that would really draw fresh air into my apartment (5 rooms, total ~1000sq ft).
When this is running on high exhaust, and with only a few other windows open, there's a noticeable breeze coming in those windows.
I notice a distinct change in the coolness and "freshness" of the inside air after only a few minutes.
It is pretty loud when it's on high, but it's not the obtrusive roar that I've seen described in other reviews.
When it's on low, the noise isn't bad at all - it's quieter than the oscillating stand fan I'd use otherwise.
I am using this as a whole house attic fan and it works just fine.
There is little noise and the hot air exhausted into the attic then escapes through the roof vents leaving both attic and house nice cooled.
From 106 degree daytime temperature, the fan will decrease the temperature to exactly the outside overnight temperature.
Does exactly what it's supposed to, extremely well.
Done!This fan gusts air like a tornado!  It's a completely different class of product, vs.
those little toy-like "twin window fans" made by everyone, and sold everywhere, that barely move any air.My house is a 900 sq.
brick ranch, 1950's built with original windows (wooden sash/panels), and no central A/C.
This is truly a whole-house fan for me!  Completely turns over the entire house air in a matter of seconds.
The direction of air flow (intake/exhaust) changes with a simple manual turn-knob.
There is a BIG difference between low/medium/high settings, which enables you to customize air flow to your liking.
Since the knob is manually operated, there are no complex, computerized electronics to malfunction.
While I'm readily technically competent, I HATE it when simple things are un-necessarily complicated, & therefore prone to electro/digital malfunction.
In the front, the grill (& center control knob) extends out into the room about 7".
The entire unit is off-white / cream-colored / neutral.
It looks retro-designer/ mid-century, a bit industrial-looking maybe.
I've searched for 17 years, & this is by FAR the best fan I've ever found.
I put this in a upstairs room to circulate the air up there.
Works pretty good, It has a clicking sound when you first turn it on, but no big deal.
Not real loud on med and slow speed but on high a bit loud.
I really like being able to  shut the window when the weather gets bad.
Wish it had a little more power on high but for the price you cannot beat it.
The barn isn't real big so there's wasn't enough air flow in there with only 1 window & 1 door so.
I love that you can put it in the window & still be able to close the window behind it during bad weather.
I've had this exact model for about two years.
This fan is very good at exhausting inside smoke to the outside.
Electric reversing makes three speeds available for either exhausing or bringing fresh air in directly with just the twist of a knob.
At medium and high speeds it helps to crack a window on the other side of the house.
Think of it as an 'attic fan' in your window.
Closely follow instructions when installing to avoid a noisy fan.
Not properly mounted will result in vibration and more noise than necessary.
(Also make sure base of fan is firmly sitting on the window sill when mounted...this will almost ensure vibration is minimal) 2.
Fan needs to be cleaned at least annually (especially if you smoke).
I searched for an exhaust fan for our new, hot garage.
It pulls and exhausts a lot of air and that is what it is supposed to do.
Don't make life more complicated then it has to be.
With all my searching, Amazon gave me the best deal and with my rewards from my Amazon credit card the fan cost me $54.
What's not to like when other stores wanted as much as $110?.
I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years.
After much research (the original fan's company went out of business) I found this fan was the closest  to my old one.
The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much.
I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised.
The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air.
The fact that is reversible is very useful.
Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house.
I'm a smoker in a small 1100 square foot house and was tired of the lingering smoke, yellowed papers, drapes, etc.
I live in Florida and the humidity is killer so it's not real productive to open windows to vent.
I ordered 2 of these 16" fans and boy are they big! They work incredibly well.
I use one as an intake (High pressure area) and the other as an exhaust (Low pressure area).
I'll probably order 2 of them to use for the winter/spring months then have these 16" bad boys for the summer/fall months.
I can imagine these fans would be heavenly for people with pets, cigar smokers, for cooking strong smelling foods like fish, etc.
As you can see I am pleasantly surprised and very happy on my purchases.
Also love the fact that the fans are both intake/exhaust.
This fan is a good fan but does not move the amount of air I want to move.
this somewhat does the  job but really not enough.
I might be asking for too much for its size etc.
I like the fact that it is reversable and it is adjustable to fit wide or narrow windows.
I'd give it a try and see if it works for you.
I live in LA and summer can get to the low 100s.
In the evenings though the temperature can dip into the 60s.
So I though of venting out the heat and drawing in the cool air, at night and early morning.
I installed this in one of the casement windows in my house.
The way I installed it allowed for the window to be closed without taking down this fan.
It does create a cool breeze as it is drawing in the cooler fresh air.
The indoor temperature does increase by about 5 degrees by dusk.
When the Outdoor temperature goes below the indoor temperature, I open all the windows and doors and turn on this exhaust fan.
This system works very well for us and I am very happy with this purchase since I am saving so much money.
This paid for itself after only 2 weeks.
The first fan I purchased like this was in 1992 from Sears.
It had their name on it, but it was obviously built by Lasko.
That original is still functional, but after 14 years, it was time for a new one.
Must be a proven, solid design to have been in production this long.
It moves the air through my home easily, but my house is smallish, only about 1500 square ft.
My only gripe concerns the fan guard, or grill, which faces towards the outside, through the open window.
This grill is plastic, which we all know doesn't last forever.
Exposed to direct sunlight and the elements, this grill will eventually become brittle.
These are great fans--I bought one for the upstairs hall, and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home.
WIth both of them running on exhaust, the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night.
There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though.
We've used this for a week now.Installation: it is easy, but may require some work to install, depending on your window frame.
I really like these and would recommend them, but with the understanding that you will have permanent screws in the window sills year round.
AS I AM IN AN APARTMENT,FORCED TO INSTALL WINDOW FAN WITH WINDOW SCREEN STILL IN WINDOW---WHICH DECREASES FAN PERFORMANCE.
This is not able to go in front of my window, as the window I use it in is a double.
However, I popped the screen out, and this fan fits perfect.
I make sure at least three windows are opened, and it works great.
I've used the reversible feature a couple times, and I'm glad it's there, but mostly it's on high and exhaust.
The blades spin freely suggesting little bearing drag to strain the motor.
I found that it easily fits several of my windows without actually mounting it (i.e., installing the four screws that come with it).
If my house were bigger I'd buy another.
It works wonderfully either on exhaust or intake.
I am just as satisfied with this one.
My window sill is so narrow, I can't fit a box fan.
The unit went in with 1/2 inch to spare and guess what? You don't have to use the wooden mounting screws.
I grabbed 4 1"long machine screws with nuts to tighten them and extended the screws until it slide into the grooves of the window.
It does feel flimsy at the mount point.
But for my 1100 sq ft place, I can feel the air wafting throughout the entire length of the unit on high.
There is no need to be in the same room to feel the benefit.
I suspect I will use it before I go to bed and reduce the setting or turn it off.
this fan is totally awesome! Its a bit heavy and you will need to kind of brace it in most windows but man.
the vent or exhaust features provide some great airation to the home.
One of the best home fans I have purchased over the last few years.
I just bought this heater after seeing a co-worker's unit.
My office area, in the corner of a very large room, is extremely cold all year round.
I have been getting by with a small DeLonghi Safeheat, but wanted something taller to provide heat to my upper body.
I also suffer from hot flashes so I needed something that oscillated.I didn't read any reviews here first.
Just went by my co-worker's glowing praise for hers.
She does sit in an office and I don't.
However, the features seemed to fit my bill.I am quite happy with the heater.
I appreciate the different heat and fan settings.
The oscillation works as I'd hoped - not concentrating the heat right on me.
It keeps me warmer and cuts the draft from the windows.
It is very nice to have a remote so I'm not jumping up and down to change the settings.
I bought it knowing that it would never really heat my area up to the temperatures given.
I have to use the small one for my feet.
The second problem is the beep!  I can understand fully how this would be a problem in a bedroom.
It would wake me up!The light doesn't bother me since I only use it during the day.
I understand people's problem with them in the bedroom, though.
[g]For me, the heater only misses a score of 5 due to the annoying beep sound.
I use it more than air conditioning when it's hot.
Good fan for drawing in the cool night air.
We leave it on all night in the reverse setting and it's completely changed our sleep pattern for the better.
It keeps our room cool and drones out the loud road noise.3.
I love having the option of having the window open still with the fan off and a soft breeze.4.
The unit is not very attractive so we have a cafe curtain in front of it.
When we turn it on, the curtain just blows upward and is not in the way.5.
Install it on a window with a screen.
They were sucked in and didn't have a chance.
That means that when it rains or cold out, you have to remove the fan to close the window.
Cooking smells are eliminated very fast with the three speed reversible motor.
I just bought mine from rural king for $59.
Im not experienceing any rattles or anything on high speed.
But on cooler nights you can put this fan on intake and bring in the fresh night air which is one thing I like.
You can just open a couple of windows a few inches and feel the air being pulled in.
The fan cannot cool the air any more than the actual temp is but it might feel cooler.
The reason I bought mine is to not use the ac any more than I have too maybe save a buck or two.
Its sort of nice to be able to close the window behind the fan which Ive never been able to do that before.
But we will see how this fan holds up.
This will be my 6th Lasko 2155A Fan purchased since the year 2000.
I have kept 2 to 3 running at any given time between the months of March and November whenever possible/necessary.
This fan is one of 3 that work without flaws.
We've tried to repair the others, cleaned them every year, to no avail.
I painted the wood to match the room paint and it seems to work well.
Our windows are of the cheap variety (drywall with alum.
I just waited until amazon.com was selling this and pounced on it (due to the low price).
I'm happy with these and will probably continue to purchase these if they are still made.
Please comment to this review if you think this could be it.
I use non-aerosol hairspray (on my hair) in the room where the fan is.
Only fans that drew the air from the room were affected.
In prior years, that fan was set up to allow air in, not out, for room re-circulation.
So in that case it was blowing the spray away from the fan.
Opinions? (I have tried google.com to search for this possibility, to no avail).
if you have side sliding windows you have to block off the gap above the fan.
the 'wings' that slide out to adjust the width of the fan are insufficient to support the fan vertically.
not a huge deal I cut a piece of foamcore to fill the gap but prevents window closing with fan installed.
It does draw a good amount of air and runs quiet enough on medium to sleep in the same room.
I started searching for a reversible window fan early, so that when the summer heat hits 99% I will be prepared.
I had a Lasko reversible window fan that my sister gave me used, and that fan carried me thru some hot days for 6-7 years.
I searched and found 3 fans and compared prices and wow-Amazon had the best price.
I would recommend this fan to anyone who needs a great reversible window fan.
for a fan that could pull air thru the whole house, but did not want to pay $200 for one.
This machine seems to have done it, quietly...quieter that I thought it would be.
It is a two-directional fan, so you can bring air in or pull it out.
It also has 3 speeds, I used the medium speed all summer, 24/7.
I don't have AC here so this was it, and it stood the test.
Really, this is close to an ideal fan if you want a window fan.
The biggest issue is the way the fan mounts to the window frame.
When you do it correctly it is secure, but not tight.
There is just enough play in the way it mounts (drops down on screws) that there is a rattle when the fan is on.
For our apartment (1200sf) this fan can make a noticeable difference in temperature and air quality in about 5-10 minutes depending on the fanspeed.
I needed a good window fan to keep the air moving in my country cottage.
I am able to limit the use of A/C if I have a means for proper ventilation.
They will slide but be patient because they will also break if forced.
Still the cheapest whole window fan I could find.
I installed this on a horizantaly sliding window.
It probably took about 10 to 20 minutes to install.
It comes with a guide for the position of the screws which helped.
I went for this 16" and it does the job just as quietly as the 20".
Very easy to install within the window frame and no vibration.
I only wish that the side extenders were metal like they are on the Air King.
The grill on the front of the fan is metal.
I am very happy with this purchase and that's why it gets FIVE STARS.
These are both excellent, high quality fans and I would not hesitate to purchase again.
This replaced a fan I broke in a drunken episode on St Patrick's day.
That was just plain dumb on my part but I am so glad that happened as this is the best fan I have ever owned.
Wife and I sleep with a fan and I instantly noticed the fan pushes way more air then the other last fan I had.
I sleep like a baby and even get cold from time to time which I never did before.
We have central air conditioning but only one control unit downstairs, so the second floor is always warmer and less comfortable than the first floor.
The best feature of this fan is the pivoting ability of the fan.
The fan pivoted and held its position straight out of the box, I did not need to adjust or tighten anything.
Photo #1 shows the fan pivoting, Photo #4 and photo#5 show two views of the fan at the bottom of my stairs.2.
Photo #3 shows the fan on the digital scale.
The fan is fairly light just under 7 pounds and 2 oz.3.
I like handle on the top of the fan.
It makes it very easy and comfortable to carry it around.4.
The fan is fairly quiet even on the high setting.
It producing no rattle noises of any sort, the sound you hear is white-noise type sound of blades pushing the air.
It is so quiet that on a number of hot nights I took that fan into the bedroom.
I am a light sleeper yet the noise from this fan did not bother me even as I was trying to fall asleep.I DON'T LIKE:-------------1.
Minor: the switch to turn on the fan in the center back of the fan.
So when you pivot it up you need to reach under the fan to turn it on or off.
Close-up of the switch is shown on Photo #2.2.
Minor: the length of the cord is 6.5 feet.
From April 2012 to September 2012 the price of this item (when sold directly from Amazon with free shipping) varied between $30 and $34.
At the time of writing this review the best price is on this oneLasko 3300 Wall Mount Fan.
For it's size this really is a light weight fan that blows a lot of air.
For the price I don't think you'll find a better fan.
We usually run it on low and it is relatively quite.
The only complain I have is the on/off controller switch is located on the back of the unit directly behind the fan blades.
Put it on top where it belongs! Who wants to do a reach around on a fan??.
I bought my windmachine after my smaller honeywell fan finally died after a number of years.
In truth, I wanted it first and foremost for white noise for my bedroom at night.
It's a powerful fan, so both the high and medium setting easily drown out any unwanted noise.
Note that this is not a small fan.
The sound is smooth and steady and it does a tremendous job circulating air in a hot or stuffy room.
I leave it on every night and it both helps me sleep and keeps me cool.
I could see this fan lasting for quite awhile and I'm still very happy with it a year later!  Included 2 images for a visual.
Before I finally installed air conditioning, I used this fan.
In fact, I had two of them and used them for several years.This is the most powerful fan I've ever had.
It doesn't rattle or clang like metal window fans.
You can tilt the fan up or down and than lock it into position using the knobs on the side.
I still use mine to dry clothes that I don't want to place in the drier.
I hang them over the shower rod and turn the fans setting to high.
The clothes are dry within a couple of hours.
I had one for about 7 years and absolutely love them super high powered.
The low setting is still very strong and kinda loud.
but high is like sitting inside a wind tunnel.
I have a standard box fan and this is 10x more powerful.
It it large, but light weight and easy to move around.
It moves a huge amount of air totally silently.
I had another Lasko Wind Machine and it lasted for years.
It finally bit the dust and I ordered this one as a replacement.
I'm not particularly fond of the &#34;on&#34; button being on the back, but the machine is very good at moving the air around.
Not quite as powerful as my old one, but still very good.
I use it by door and it blasts in cooler air in evening.
I use this fan to keep the air circulating; living in an old house where the AC is not too efficient.
I will most likely buy another one in the future for another part of the house.
It is an outstanding fan! I'm using it with another older wind machine from Lasko to help cool down my home in early morning hours!.
Have 4 Lasko fans and all work great.
This is the second Wind Machine that I've owned, our first one just stopped working after almost 10 years.
We use ours almost exclusively in our very large master bedroom on the high setting (we like the sound and the breeze).
Others mentioned that it's not all that powerful, but we find it plenty strong for indoor/casual use.
It's not an industrial shop fan by any means, but it's great for cooling a large room, painted walls, even outside on a deck.
It's very light for it's size and the tilting feature is nice.
We use floor fans so we can keep the AC at 80 and still survive in South Texas.
This was our first experience with this model, and we plan to get more of them.
They circulate the air superbly and make surprisingly little noise for their size.
I need a fan to sleep by...the white noise is perfect.
I'm extremely happy with it and I think you will be too!.
In my experience, Wind Machines are the best fans out there.
They are essentially the only type of fan we have used for years.
An added bonus is that they are ready to go right out of the box, no assembly required.
I don't often rave about a product, but this one deserves it.
This is what I so love about it: 1.
Just a steady strong stream of wonderful air.
It arrived in the military pouch system with the box a bit smashed, but not a single dent on the item.
I can cart it room to room very easily.
Even though it's so light, it sits on the floor very stably.
The only sound it makes is the sound of air moving.
The design is compact, extreme care given to maximizing output for the footprint.
This fan is really handy to keep around.
It is a bit loud on high, but I expected that with this type of fan.
I can use it anywhere in my house and move it from room to room as I need it.
I think this is by far the best fan I've ever owned.Will post a couple pictures for you to get a better look at it.
I would recommend this to anyone in need of a fan.
The Wind Machine fan by Lasko is exactly the way it is advertised here on [...].
First off if you are looking for a quiet fan, go somewhere less because this is not what you are working for.
I highly recommend for those who need large air flow and a good noise level while they sleep.
Works just as good as the heavy duty silver fans.
It brings all that cool night air right into my house.
Burrrrr I'm getting goose bumps now because I'm freezing.
Let me get up and turn it to low now since its extremely cool in here.
I used to have 3 but the third one disappeared.
Oh Well , anyway fan is definitely worth the price.
Compared to those pricey fans that don't rake reviews half as good as this.
I had one of these fans that ran great for about 6 years....being used every day.
Good fan though and I will likely replace my dead one with another one just like it.
I'm surprised they still make this one and sell it.
A great fan, light weight, easy to move and aim!  I have especially appreciated this fan in our immediate 100 plus temps.
We use a heat pump which looses effectiveness past the ground level.
The price is right and it moves air very well.
I used my two seasons, chucked it and got another one.
This fan is really doing a good job.
This fan helps the whole house and keeps the air fresh and moving.
Even on the lowest setting, this thing is definitely a wind machine.
While my apartment is central air conditioned, I like to keep the thermostat on 78 to save energy.
I purchased this to use with my indoor bike trainer.
Is somewhat loud but certainly does the job and more.
I only wish it came with a remote control to change speeds.
My apt gets super hot in the summer and without central air, it can be tough during the days.
The AC we have isn't quite strong enough to really cool down the place below 77 degrees or so.
This fan has made the summer so much more bearable.
Moving air in the apt makes a huge difference.
It usually stays on the low setting, as that is more than enough to provide adequate current in the room.The fan is pretty quiet.
There's 3 speed settings, and of course if you have it on high, it can get a little loud.
But it's not nearly as loud as other fans I've owned, so I was pleased with that.
It barely weighs anything, so moving it from one room to the next, if necessary, is easy.
It has a nice handle on top for easy transport.
The fan can also be tilted easily so you can direct the air wherever you'd like.
If you don't want the air blowing right on you, you can tilt it so it blows towards the ceiling.
If you want it pointed at you, pivot it to the necessary angle.My only issue with the fan is the ability to clean it.
It doesn't have any easy way to disassemble it, at least that I can see.
Because it sits on the floor, it often sucks up my girlfriend's lose hairs and the catch on the grill.
We originally got the first one like this from Walmart years ago and they no longer carry them.
I bought it because it was cheap and  be easy to operate.
I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker, how to gauge time and amounts of water etc.
Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers.
As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.
This style cooker has the "jiggler valve" on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds.
Personally, I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside.
I was afraid of pressure cookers most of my life and this inexpensive one has soothed my fears.
It does the job and does it well.
The wife and I got married in 1953.
We got a mirro 4 Qt as a wedding gift.
Use the cooker at least once a week.
The lid gasget, jiggler, blow out plug are all in good shape.
On thing we have always done is to wipe a little olive oil on the gasget.
I think this little lubrication is the reason the gaget has lasted so long.
Great old  pot--- I have a whole chcken jiggling away right now.
I have been cooking with pressure cookers for 30+ years now.
I had an old Mirro cooker (8qt) that I used for over 20 years.
I had to buy a few gaskets over the years but it kept on working.
Believe it or not, a mouse got into the garage and chewed out the pressure check valve.
I could not get a replacement because the cooker was so old!!! I bought the new one and I read the directions.
Imagine my disappointment when I read that the cooker would not get hot enough on a ceramic top stove.
I have had a ceramic top stove ever since they were invented and have used other pressure cookers on them with no problems whatsoever.
Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run.
A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it.
What can I say except that this does exactly what it should.
I no longer have to borrow my mother's food press to make blackberry jelly.
Next year I'll make sure to make even more, since I won't be stuck doing it on a schedule.
Used this food press for making jelly and to prevent seeds and other impurities when canning strawberry jam and jelly.
My 'ricer' - collander - food press arrived just an hour ago.
I have fond memories of this 'ricer', a favorite kitchen implement of my Dad's.
I still have an old pestle from the old days.
The design is a little different from the ones of my childhood, but I think this design appeals to me more.
I love 'riced' potatoes and anticipate using this 'food press' to make tomato purees and finish other fruit.
Good if you are working with small quantities.
For larger quantities, use the kitchenaid mixer attachments.
Can  not live with out this if you do any canning.
Have a OLD ONe and got this one so my daughter has one she is starting to take interest in canning  Recommend.
Great when I used it for Apple Butter.
I will be using this for many years.
This food press is perfect for tomatoes and apples.
It's sturdy and sits perfectly in a medium size bowl.
I would recommend this Mirro food press to everyone that likes to can.
I got this for my parentsThey didn't want a large size, and this was just what they were looking for.
They've had it for a little over a month, and so far they have no complaints at all.
Working Great! I have only used it a few times but so far very happy with it and it's smaller size.
As always with Amazon, fast and easy delivery,.
Back in the day, moms all had pressure cookers and made beef stews and pot roasts in them.
These cookers are being rediscovered and are making a big comeback as they're not just for stew any more.
Hundreds of new recipes are appearing and Amazon has some really good pressure cooker cookbooks available.
size (just for 2 of us) but larger sizes are available.
Mom was right, they are FAST, make delicious food and will impress guests.
They're not expensive - give this a try, you won't be disappointed.
i love using a pressure cooker because it makes meats tender...also is faster too cook with.
I got for camping and keep my big one at home.
Also as its aluminum it's much lighter weight for the trailer.
This one is a 4 quart, very easy and fast to use.
I used it when I had a family of 5, and is still useful today with just my husband and I.
I've only used it a couple of times but would recommend it for small to medium roasts, etc.
Our 20+ year old 4 quart Presto pressure cooker has had at least half a dozen gasket replacements.
For those of you who eat things like wheat berries, this is the gadget for you.
If you have a family, get the next bigger size, but this is good for one old guy who camps.
I was finally convinced that I need a pressure cooker for meat due to my work hours.
I looked everywhere for the smallest size, they were either unavailable or too expensive.
Reviews here showed great product so I bought it.
I used it the very first day and I couldn't be more satisfied.
Meat cooked in 12 minutes vs 30-45 minutes.
I gave it four stars only because the color changes after washing it but that doesn't affect the cooking.
It comes with directions which explained how long each food takes to cook.
I have read several comments about loose screws on the handles.
Go to your local auto parts store and ask for &#34;Loc-Tight&#34;.
You clean the screws of any oil, put on a few drops of &#34;Loc-Tight&#34; and replace the screws.
Let then cure a few hours per the instructions...and...Problem solved.
I am using the cooker for about 3 years now and so far everything is going fine.
Throw anything in it, it can make a nice well cooked food in 5-10 minutes.
Key is let it cool off on its own.
However, I really wish I purchased the steel one since aluminium body looks kind of ugly after some use.
It cooks very well, easy to use, zero problem and I use it regularly.
One suggestion: add a switch to let the steam go out once the cooking is done.
So many great meals she prepared with it.
After a few days of them here we went to buy  cooking utensils and kitchenware for our new home here in Miami.
I purchased for her a Presto 6 quart and 4 quart cooker.
Do not have to say she was delighted.
I still have these Prestos and they are like new.
I just have ordered the gaskets and pressure valve through the Presto site here in the Web.
Just to say I cook a lot myself and used them very often.
Presto stands back on all their models and have replacement parts for all their cookers old and new.
They even have the originals Manuals with recipes and user instructions and times for every model the have ever produced.
I should say these cookers would last for generations if well treated and cleaned.
They are part of the dear memories I have of my family.
I really wanted to use this for sterilizing pint canning jars, but it is not tall enough.
however, it does cook an artichoke or two, and they get done fast, and they are cooked all the way through.
It was a great unit and we hated to have to replace it.
This new one works just as well as the old one did when it was new.
You can pay a lot more for a pressure cooker but I don't see how it would work any better.
Includes recipe book and time tables, very important information when using this pot.
So easy to use and doesn`t take up much space.
This is my first pressure cooker and I can't complain so far.
I had always known that cooking under a higher pressure would accelerate the cooking process.
I had just never realized by how much.
With this pressure cooker, hours turn into minutes.
Even slow-cooked chili which normally takes 6 hours of slow cooking to get it right can be done in 30 minutes.
Amazing!This pressure cooker is sturdy and easy to assemble.
It is also remarkably easy to use, just put the lid on and rotate it sideways until the handles lock.
It is also easy to clean, as easy as any other pot or pan.And there are soooo many recipes!Very much recommended!.
I live at 9500 ft altitude where it can take many hours to tenderize anything.
I cook stew meat in 25 to 30 mins, pot roast in 50 mins, veggies in 5 mins after it gets up to temp.
I use mine a lot, 3 times a week ($7 for both at AMZ) which is why I am here commenting.
Don't get the aluminum ones, not good for you.Very safe and fool proof.
It is well made and the perfect size for our family.
We have cooked beans, chicken, beef, and many other items in it and it works great and is high quality.
The first one is still going strong, in constant use since 1984.
This is the first time I owned a pressure cooker.
It's very easy to use and helps me cut down the time to cook beans, meat,.
At first I hated the heavy metal cap that sits on top of the steam valve.
I always forgot to take it off before opening the lid, and one time it fell down hard on the floor, almost hitting my toes.
It's a visual/audio indicator of how much steam is coming out.
If it rocks too fast then I'd need to lower the fire.
On a pressure cooker, more heat doesn't cook any faster.
If you do this, be very careful or else you'd get burn.
Seriously, this is hotter than normal steam.It works very well.
But the bottom has a layer of other metal to absorb heat, so it's not any different compared to my aluminum Mantra cooker.
Stainless is easier to clean as well, and looks better.
Some people worry that aluminum causes alzheimer, but there's no medical proof of it.
Oh well, at least I get the stainless steel so that I don't have to wonder.
Brand reputation matters, we are sure that replacement parts from Presto will always be available.
Boy could I not have been more wrong.
And at that temperature it can break down the tough parts of meats and cook things very quickly.
Yet it also retains nutrients and tastes good.
Well it does cook fast and it is tasty.
I will take the experts opinion that it is also a healthy way to cook.As a PC newbee I had no idea what to expect.
First off is a little bit of assembly.
This is not a pan or a microwave or something like that.
It is safe..but also something that is, well, under pressure.
After getting familiar with the parts of the pressure cooker we cooked our first meal, a pot roast.
We used, frankly, a pretty cheap piece of meat but it came out tasting fantastic.
Once the pressure seals the cooker most of the time you have to then reduce the heat.
We have done some chicken dishes and some rice dishes.
It has turned out perfect rice in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise.
We are still getting a feel for seasoning.
Granted it has only been a couple of weeks but we have eaten out much less these 2 weeks.
We picked up a well regarded cookbook on AmazonPressure Perfect: Two Hour Taste in Twenty Minutes Using Your Pressure Cookerand so far so good.
This could easily become the main way you cook, it has that a good a combination of benefits and realtive ease of use.
What it excels at is...great results/unit of effort and time.
I can't see many other ways that you can maximize your cooking effort and cooking time than a PC.
I am very happy with this pressure cooker, seems to be very well made (which is important for safety).
This is my second presto pressure cooker in a year.
I tried all the thrifty tricks to get out scorched ick but it didn't work.
My Presto is my go too pressure cooker for potatoes, makes great cheesecake, I love pressure cooking squash, carrots etc.
The construction is heavy and seems well made.
Just received this unit, and I'm very happy with it so far.
It is easy to assemble, sturdy, and most importantly has a very simple design which I anticipate will be durable into the future.
My previous pressure cooker was a complex affair with springs and components tucked away in plastic housing so that they could not be accessed.
This design, on the other hand, is much more simplistic, which is a very good thing.
It cost about 1/4 the price of the cheapest PC that I could get in local stores (including postage), and is a preferable design.
I have only had this for a few weeks.
I have cooked Winter squash a couple of times and it worked great.
I don't admit to being an expert on pressure cookers but this one seems to work very well.
The handles came loose the first time I used it, so tightening them really good the second time seems to have done the trick.
It's the right size to cook a roast and it's easy and safe to use.
What I usually use it for is to cook up a 3-5 pound boneless chuck roast (when it's in sale).
Here's what I do:put in a couple of tablespoons of oliver oil and brown the meat top and bottom.
This is my first experience with a pressure cooker.
Coming from an asian background it's not something we normally cook with.
We normally go the "slow cooking" route instead to make our soups and broths.
This item is great in that you can make some good stock and soups etc in about 60 to 90 minutes.
I tried using this for the first time yesterday and it was great.
I find the size of the cooker to work well for 3-4 adults.
One of the better pressure cookers we've owned.
We cook rice and lentils a lot in our pressure cooker and this makes it perfect each time.
No issues that we've had with other brands like Prestige.
This one is easy to handle, good quality, and so far so good in terms of stains.
I read the instructions, and follow them to the letter.
I had one of these great cookers long ago.
This one is made of stainless steel and seems to be lighter.
I had to attach the handles, so some assembly on this one is required.
My first recipe was, 'Ham Hocks & Navy Beans', and I cooked the pre-soaked beans and ham hocks in about 25 or 30 minutes.
I plan to cook many more dishes in this quick-cooking appliance.
Be sure to read THOROUGHLY, the instruction booklet, to safely use this(& all) pressure cookers.
I cook daily in a pressure cooker so this product is very important to me.
I have a Hawkins 2 liter cooker, prestige 3.5 liter and a presto 6 quart pressure cooker but they are all aluminum.
I've had the presto 6 qt aluminum for at least over 6 years.
What I didn't like is that the steaming plate that comes with the cooker is  made of aluminum.
But its not a deal breaker for me.
I think that Presto is a very dependable brand and I'll happily recommend it to anyone.
The handle seems to loosen after using it several times.
I had another one, and it did the same thing.
Presto is one of the best, but I think they should address the handle problem.
I remember a bit of a kitchen disaster during my childhood when the seal blew off my mother's pressure cooker.
It's super for quickly making beans and brown rice which otherwise take so long.
Everything cooks to perfection in just a fraction of the usual time.I like the fact that this Presto model is stainless steel rather than aluminum.
This pressure cooker set includes a special insert rack that allows you to cook multiple foods at once without their flavors intermingling.
When filled, it is a bit heavy and it take two hands for me to carry it.Clean-up isn't difficult.
I wash it by hand even though it is considered dishwasher-safe.
It comes with very good detailed instructions for cooking various foods.
The instructions addressed questions we had without having to do further research.
The cooker can only be about half full for some items and two thirds full for other times.
I will check those line markers and update if I got it wrong.
We have tried Beef, Poultry, and Pork in various different vegatables in the cooker and have not had a failure once.
The stainles version is the only way to go.
This replaces it's predecessor aluminum 4-quart Presto Pressure Cooker that Aunt Mildred gave me when I married.
I'm 76 now and was searching for a new gasket on Google.
I found the gasket and a new handle (the handle is cracked from so many years of use).
I also saw the new stainless steel 4-quart pressure cooker that I looked at again after ordering the gasket and handle.
I ordered it and am so pleased that I did.
It works as well as the old reliable that has served me for so long.
I like the rocking steam escape sound because I can monitor it for adjustment without going and looking at a gauge.
I had bought another brand some time ago but had gone back to my favorite Presto.
I was looking for a replacement for some weirdo one my hubby's ex left him years ago.
I have a giant-sized Presto pressure canner and love it.
So I like Presto and liked the size of the ex's weirdo canner.
Six quarts is just about the perfect size since I rarely cook for a crowd anymore.This is a nice, solid, reliable cooker.
Presto does a good job on the owners manual, some basic recipes, etc.
The cooker has a little rack so you can keep your meat off the floor of the cooker.This is not a canner.
You could (and I have) use it as a little baby canner for a small load of small jars.
I have used it as a canner for about 4-5 pints.
The instructions do not say this is a canner, and you probably should know what you're doing if you plan to can with this.
This takes some practice, and knowing your food and your stove.
It makes a rythmic rocking noise, not too fast,not too slow.I find clean up a breeze.
I soak it a couple minutes, if needed, then pop her in the DW.
I would go for the 6 quart for extra room next time.
I have an electric pressure cooker that has a hard anodized interior that is sometimes impossible to clean.
This stainless steel pressure cooker is a breeze to clean.
I soaked some black beans and after only 4 minutes cooking under pressure, I had a pot of beans.
The 6 quart size is perfect for me since you can't fill it too much.
I have been using this one since about 2008.
Very reliable, nice flat bottom that is very thick.
I use it on a glass top stove without any problem.
My firstPresto 01781 23-Quart Pressure Canner and Cookeris for canning.
It is this huge cooker, not for your everyday meal.
I picked the 4 quart cooker for its' size.
If you give me a large pot, I am going to fill it up! Then I have to deal with all the left overs.
This cooker is the right size for two with plenty of left overs for the week.
My first recipe was with dried beans (black, pinto) for chili.
The booklet said only cook for 3 min.
Because I have tried to cook dried bean on the stove top and it took hours and hours.
And they still weren't done to my liking.
So I left the beans in about five min.
they were almost over cooked, tender and delicious!I am going to love this cooker.
Keep in mind you can only fill it 2/3 full while cooking with pressure.
I believe this so food particles don't get trapped in the vent.The basic theory is you cook the longest cooking time ingredient first.
Let's say, chuck roast then you release the pressure when almost done.
That's the time you add Potatoes, onions seasonings and carrots.
After reading the booklet for cooking times and recipes it is almost faster then a microwave oven.....REALLY!.
We have had a pressure cook for many years.
It was great for camping, for we could make New England Boil Dinner.
My wife has our old one at the shore, and we use it a lot.
Now, I can make the dinners here, and we thing they are the best pressure cookers around.
i bought this over a year ago and finally decided to write a review after having used it.
I didn't think it was gonna be a very smart purchase as it seemed to be limited in the uses.
well let me be the first to say i was wrong.
Making soups and stews are a no brainer, making a modest batch of soup stock in short notice is such a time saver.
why slave in the kitchen when you can be almost a one pot meal.
plus these meals are awesome in the fall.
in this pressure cooker to about 250 degrees F.
For instance, the tougher fibers in meat will convert to gelatin, making the meat more tender.
As a result,  pressure cookers are great for braised dishes with tough meats, such as chili.
For these purposes, this pressure cooker rocks.Larger pressure cookers can also be used for canning (because the higher temperatures can kill more bad things.
This pressure cooker really is not large enough for this task.
If you are not a canner though, compare the prices of this against those larger models.
I think you will be back looking at this one.
I had purchased a Kuhn-Rikon cooker but it finally failed.
I bought this one from Amazon and it works great for one reason: It cannot fail.
I'm a novice pressure cooker user but this one "just works".
Simple to use both for pressure cooking and for sauteeing.
I like that it's stainless and that it was cheap!.
Aside from it being a pressure cooker, this is the nicest pot I own.
It also comes with a useful recipe booklet.
I can't add much to all the 5-star reviews here, but for what it's worth, 'I like it too!'.
Presto is one of the few old time manufacturers that have maintained quality.
This pressure cooker is very well made and works perfectly.
I would recommend it to a friend (or even a stranger).
I am very happy with it and fully expect it to last for many years.
I've been using a pressure cooker ever since I was young.
Everyone in my family has one and they do last for a long time.Now, I cook professionally.
One of my valuable cooking vessel is the pressure cooker.
It takes really tough meat and make is buttery soft.
I haven't tried cooking veggies on these things, just because they are more delicate than a piece of shank.
By the way, I just ordered two for gifts.
And it made from stainless steal.One word of caution though!!!.
When cooking with this, make sure after you hear it whistle, turn down your heat to a low medium to a medium!!!.
It's compared to having a roll boil and a boiling water; it's just a waste of energy.
I've heard form a couple of users who neglected this "alarm", actually had their "tops" blow up.
A couple of users also reported, they actually got burned by the steam.
But, don't let this scare you!!!  Like any other tools, you have to know how to use them properly.
Always clean the rubber seal coz, it does accumulate food residue.
And always, always be careful with dealing with high pressure and high heat.
This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be.
Every now and then, it releases the steam so no pressure can build up.
If I jiggle it, to get it to set, it generally falls down into the kettle.
Remember, this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching.
Love this long lasting and dependable pressure cooker! I got it many years ago and haven't even had to replace the rubber yet.
I was going to spend more money on a more expensive model.
IT does the jobs without frills and cleans up great.
if it hits the fan than i can just buy another to replace it.
She is very happy with her new one and so are we.
I always avoided pressure cookers until a little over a year ago.
I love it, but it is annoying to have to drag it out when I wanted to use it.
I saw this smaller size stove-top variety and hoped it would be as good as the electric.
It's better!  I never put it away because it has become my go-to pan whether or not I'm using the pressure cooking feature.
It's a good weight, great heat distribution, NOT aluminium, and sturdy.
As a pressure cooker, I find that I can turn the heat on my stove to between 2 and 3 and it works beautifully.
From using the other pressure cooker once or twice a month, I find I use this one three-four times a week.
Minor issue - yes - the screws do rust.
One of these days, I'll take one to Home Depot so I can get a non-rusting version.
I like it, and I use it occasionally.
my mother used her pressure cooker to feed 5 kids on a regular basis, and the stories of her mother's old ring-style pressure cooker, well.
Learn how to use one and you will never live without one.
This one is quite good because if the cooker isn't stainless steel, putting it in the dishwasher will turn it white.
And certain ailments claim a link to higher levels of aluminum in the blood.
This order was a terrific bargain!  The product is excellent.
I would recommend to prospective buyers that they ascertain their needs first.
I gave this Presto 6-quart pressure cooker to my daughter for her birthday.
She works full time and thought this would be a real time-saver for her.
It has met her expectations and is very happy with it.
She's able to prepare meals in minutes, which means she's not only saving time, but eating better.
In comparing this unit with others available, the price was great and turned out to be a very good value.
This pressure cooker is our first one and our first time to cook with one.
We used one of the recipes printed in the user's manual, Herbed Chicken.
The recipe calls for basil, celery, oregano, parsley, onions, and garlic, along with other readily available ingredients.
It was not difficult to use, and clean up was effortless and fast.
Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery service, and thanks Presto for the fine pressure cooker.
We look forward to using it on a weekly basis.
I have used this cooker quite a number of times and it does an excellent job of what it is suppose to do.
I've used a Premium grade, Innova 8 Qt.
for years, It is way too big for every day, single person use.
The Presto works decently, but not well built.
The handles are fastened by only one screw.
The lid closing stop, catches past the point it should be.
The lid pressure open-lock safety takes effort to seat when heating up.The 4 QT and 6 QT are both 8 1/2 in.
Without the lid, the 4 Qt is 4 1/2 in.
height, the 6 Qt is only 2 in.
A few recipes are too big for the 4 Qt.Induction compatible??? A magnet sticks to the bottom and top, but not the sides.
This was purchased as a gift for my daughter.
Hopefully she will enjoy hers as much as I do mine after many years of use.
It's a good pressure cooker that works well for most of my cooking.
I use this to cook mostly my meal consisting of a vegetable & fish mixture.
I use 1/2 cup of distilled water (which in my opinion is the bare minimum).
You must always start by adding at least a 1/2 cup of water before adding any vegetables.
My veggies & fish cook in about 2-1/2 to 3 minutes, after which i run cold water over the cooker to cool it down.
The only problem i have had is getting the lid to go on sometimes.
But these pressure cookers are really good, you can cook some really healthy food quickly in them.
I replaced my old Aluminium Pressure cooker (4 Litre) from India with this wonderful stainless steel pressure cooker.
The quality is great and the price is fantastic.
This cooker does not blow the whistle by itself (starts rocking) but instead I manually let out the steam 4-5 times.
Saves a lot of energy and cooks quickly.
I have 2 dabbas ( containers ) from the previous cooker that fit inside this cooker.
That way I can cook Dal and rice at once.
I ordered an extra gasket just in case :) Always better to keep extra gaskets.
so far i have made great indian food successfully with no problems and its fairly simple to clean.
I have had a 4 quart Presto stainless steel pressure cooker for 28 years and it is still going strong.
I decided I needed a 6 quart for larger meals.
This item is replacing an aluminum 5 QT cooker.
Stainless steel is far superior for cooking and cleaning, and the 6QT size is perfect when four are being fed.
Even spaghetti sauce is a snap with this unit, something I never attempted in the old aluminum pot.
Cooks for 2 people easily..***A cooking rack comes with it, also....!!.
I have several larger pressure cookers, but there are just two of us now that the children are gone and married.
Like the extra handle on the opposite side - easier for transporting from stove to sink.
My old MirroMatic pressure cooker was over 40 years old & I decided it was time for a replacement.
Instead of the old all aluminum pan I decided to get the stainless steel pan for ease of cleaning.
What a difference!  The aluminum core on the bottom provides the even heating, & the stainless steel makes for the easiest of cleaning.
I really enjoy the rocker weight on top instead of my old weight with 3 different pressure settings.
Tonight, I'm making Swiss steak with only 18 minutes of cook time.
The cool down time is much faster than with the old aluminum pan also.
Moderately priced and cleans up well I hand wash this.
I can't believe I waited this long to buy a pressure cooker.
Just the right size and seems to be of high quality.
Now I wish I'd have ordered the 6-quart.Even though it's stainless, it's very lightweight.
This is handy as I have permanent chest pain after surgery, so lifting can be difficult.It works fine.
It makes very concentrated fast broths in the summer when I don't want things simmering on the stove for hours.
Similarly, I can cook big batches of legumes and freeze in meal-sized portions fast.
made a whole chicken in less than 30min.
Very pleased with this product!...Just wanted to add a note.
I never run water over the pan to cool it down...as it is still cooking.
I know how long meat and veggies take when cooking traditionally, so I time it based on experience.
When you let it cool on it's own, that is part of the actual cooking time with the pressurization.
Follow the instructions and you can't go wrong.
I just shut the fire down about 10min less to incorporate cool down.
I already own a 6qt Fagor over 15 years old and a 2qt Kuhn Rikon.
I used locktite red on each to prevent them from loosening.
Note the top is not stainless though or is a cheap imitation thereof.
Unlie the KR and FAGOR this pot weight wobbles making a noise.
All in all for $36 a good deal.
because the screws keep pulling out of the handles (no inserts like this one) and other things keep failing like the gasket and handles themselves.
I did quite a bit of research online before purchasing this pressure cooker.
It's definitely not top of the line but it absolutely does the job at a economical price.
This is my first pressure cooker so I wasn't even sure if I would use it often, but the Presto has won me over.
I use it multiple times each week - it's a fantastic convenience.
Note that there is some minor assembly required.
I've used pressure cookers for many years including some of those very expensive models.
This is one of the best cookers I've ever owed.
This cooker is constructed of high quality stainless steel and is very easy to use.
If you follow a few simple rules, you'll never have a problem.
I use my cooker weekly for everything from cream of potato soup to braised lamb shanks with wine sauce.
My only con: wish it was made in the USA, otherwise, highly recommend.
The only caution is if you are cooking for more than 2-3 people you may want to get a 6 or 8 quart.
You can only fill 2/3 of the pot up and it limits how much you can cook.
When my last cooker warped I asked for a replacement for Christmas - yep, that's how much I love them.
My last pressure cooker was also a pressure caner for putting up vegetables.
However we are down to just my husband and I so we don't do much canning any more.
Obviously it weighs less, takes up less room in my cupboard, and comes to heat much quicker.
What isn't to love if you are cooking for only two people as we care!.
I had an older model for years, and I wanted another Presto.
This one, as my older model, works great!.
This was a gift for someone that was just getting into caning.
Some assembly required, but appears to be a quality product.
My last one worked well for 25 years, no reason this one shouldn't do the same.
The excellent instruction manual that comes with this cooker lists appropriate cooking times for many kinds of food.
I really appreciate cooking brown rice in only twelve minutes and pre-soaked beans in less than that.
This prevents a dangerous explosion of a loose lid.
If you feel some resistance in closing the lid, don't force anything.
Make sure the sliding flange is not preventing the cylindrical plug from rising.
The heavy rocker wobbles merrily reminding me of an old fashioned steam locomotive chugging along.
This action informs me how much I can turn the heat down to keep on cooking without wasting water or energy.
It helps save energy and it will last a lifetime.
Great product to have in the kitchen for cooking.
Much safer than the traditional ones we grew up with, great size and useful recipe book enclosed for time comparisons.
I am just very glad that they were both wrong!This is definitely one of the best purchases I have made on amazon.
I still cannot believe they sell this for $35! The pot does not feel cheap at all.
It has very sturdy handles, and a thick, heavy bottom, which holds in heat well.
Although we have guests over regularly, I find the capacity of the pot to be very good.
My hands are small, and when you've closed the top, the handle is kind of big.
I have long been familiar with the Presto brand.
Presto Pressure Cookers have been used in my family for many many years.
After the first use, I was totally sold!!!  It is easy to use and the directions are very clear and easy to understand.
Funny story, because my mom was used one before and blows up.
So when I got first time try it out I was hide in the backyard until the trimmer running then I m relax.
Shorter my cooking time and pretty good meterio.
I've looked and checked out many other pressure cookers before buying this one.
From the costly ones in department stores to others online.
Department stores prices were to high and I couldn't get any product information from the sales people I would talk with.
After reading the reviews here I decided to purchase the Presto.
The Cooker is great looking after using it for four different meals.
We have enjoyed a delicious pot roast, chicken with veggies, and a hard to cook oxtail stew.
There was no problem with reading the directions on how to use.
I did it without my husband my assistance.
I am planning on using it at least once a week for hardy winter meals.
We are living at 6,000 feet elevation, and this pressure cooker has made cooking dried beans and grains a snap.
The delivery was prompt, packaging excellent, and product quality also excellent.
This is a great addition to my kitchen.
It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal.
I first purchased 16-qt cooker/canner then purchased this one and 4-qt also.
Now I use these 3 cookers for everything.
This is a well-made, top of the line product for such a great price.
Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws (holding the handles on the lid) since they rust after a while.
Other than that, I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others.
I would definitely recommend using this to speed up crockpot recipes.
I had to replace an ancient pressure cooker that was passed down to me many years ago.
This one is much smaller but, since I don't do any canning and only cook for three people, it is the perfect size for me.
With all the warnings now about the dangers of too much aluminum in our diets, I love that it is stainless steel.
It will make the toughest cut of meat so tender that it falls apart.
Magic!  I don't know why I haven't used a pressure cooker before.
You can make lentil soup in like 10 minutes.
And this one is nice and sturdy and easy to use.
I was thrilled to discover that the stainless steel model that I purchased would work with my induction cook top.
Of my 25 year old pressure cooker, the exact same brand and style, anything that you can use for 25 years is an amazing product!.
I use this all the time I wouldn't want to be without it.Cooks fast & would buy again.
Because it cooks so quickly, we're not only enjoying dinner faster, but saving a lot of energy to boot!  Highly recommended!.
As a child I was scared to death of my mom's pressure cooker and swore I'd never have one.
If you are instructed to let it cool down on its own, it can take up to 30 minutes to cool down.
The only thing I would add to this pot would be a temperature indicater.
I would build it right into the pressure cap so I would be able to set up an optimum temperature.
At the price, it must cut some corners, right? Not so! Presto has been making these things for a long time and it shows.
Works perfectly, easy to clean, and replacement parts are widely available if needed.
I wish Presto sold it in a kit with the glass cover and vegetable basket, but...it gets an easy five stars anyway.
Not a big deal IMO, but if it bothers you, you'll need to spend two or three times as much.
I've been using Pressure Cookers for years, and was under the assumption that "size does matter".
Some tools are nice to have for those rare times when you need them, but this one gets used regularly.
I talked her into replacing it for something new, shiny and fancy.
The quality is there, and the locking mechanism is STRONG.
It's not a latch on the handle like a traditional pressure cooker.
This unit has slots all around the pan that link up to the lid, and you rotate the lid to seal the unit.
That means there's more than 8 latches on the pan.
Those beans aren't getting out any time soon.
Some people have dinged this product because it is small.
I wanted a smaller pot for making smaller batches.
The only thing that is a bit flimsy is the pressure regulator.
I had this in my wishlist & received it for Christmas.
I've used it several times & I love it.
Its smaller than the one I had previously but that is perfect for us.
Only 3 at home anymore.I love that this is made of stainless steel.
I appreciate that a LOT!Its a great product and Im so happy to have it.
Before purchasing this pressure cooker, I went to Macy's and bought an aluminum pressure cooker because it was on sale.
After cooking my meal, I noticed the inside of the pressure cooker had become terribly discolored.
I did not want my family eating out of that pressure cooker.
It is stainless steel, easy clean-up and no discoloration.
I should have known better because I had a Presto for over 25 years.
The rocker on my old one wore out and I knew it was time to get another.
If you're looking to replace an older model or just plain looking for a new pressure cooker, you won't be disappointed with this one.
I used this as a Christmas gift and the recipient couldn't have been more pleased.
I had a very bad experience with a pressure cooker.
I swore at that time to never let one in my house again.
Well, time passed and my patience with cooking grew more thin.
Beef and pork roast as well as turkey breast have been brought forth in no time at all.
Potatoes cooked to perfection in short minutes.My biggest probem is where to keep it so it is handy at all times!I highly recommend this item.
Once I finally pulled it warily from its boxand sealed it for its first trial in my home, I was hooked.
I decided to get rid of my old aluminum pressure cooker due to concerns about cooking in aluminum.
This one is way nicer, once I figured out the gizmos.
I bought this as a replacement for my 40 year old pressure cooker.
This one is stainless steel and has a heavy bottom to prevent sticking.
It cooked a chicken in about 20 min.
It is very simple to use and also inexpensive.
Have used several times and I must say I am not disappointed in my decision!  I use this item at least 1-2 times a week.
My hubby and I bought this pressure cooker last year for our first experimental use with a pressure cooker.
We were unsure of what exactly we were doing but this pressure cooker was pretty self-explanitory.
We've used it to can salmon fish and every single can came out sealed to perfection.
We were SO pleased! We've also used it for ribs and potatoes and they are soo good.
We've turned tough peices of reindeer meat into butter with this thing.
I bought this one to replace a weight-less pressure pot.
That one has an issue of leaking steam and hence does not work.This cooker is lightweight, but works very well.
The size is great for 2 or 3 people but I would get a larger one for more people.
Everything comes out tasty and the meat are tender in such a short time.
The only problems I had were in the beginning.
Also be careful when you wash the lid.
I am so pleased with my purchase of the Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker.
For shorter cooking times, pressure cooking is certainly the way to go for beans and grains.
I am totally in love with this cooker.
Simple to use and a good looking cooking tool.
I've owned several pressure cookers over the years.
This one is my current favorite for several reasons.
It's the smallest pressure cooker I own and perfect for cooking for one or two people.
Next, I'm happy with the  quality of the product.
It's hefty enough to feel substantial, yet not so heavy that it's difficult to use and clean.
The  stainless steel seems to be of very good quality--I've  had no problem cleaning it.
Last, this pressure cooker seems to cook  faster than my Fagor 6-qt.
I don't know if it's a difference in the pressure cooker or because I'm cooking less food in this one, but I like the speed.
I don't find this pressure cooker particularly noisy--I turn down the heat once pressure is obtained.
I have nothing negative to say about this product--I'd buy it again.
It cooks quick and is easy to clean.
I have had several pressure cookers over many years and this one rates up there with the best.
Sturdy, well made, now has a heat-difusing plate on the bottom.
You need a good arm to lift this cooker whether it's full or empty as there's a lot of steel there.
Yes they're outsourced from Wisconsin to China - but someone is staying on top of the process and this is still a good product.
Full size thick heat disk on bottom for even heat distribution, heat retention (for searing) and efficiency.
The most dishwasher safe pressure cooker I've looked into (though I don't have a DW and wouldn't bother to use one).
The fairly wide base was not too wide, and worked fine for cooking a single serving of rice (1/2 cup dry rice).
I have the fingers of a professional cook and have touched the metal part w/o getting burned, but it is freaking hot.
This is a gift item and it is perfect for the Christmas present recipient.
It is the right size for use and for storage.
I've owned a Presto pressure cooker for many years and have been very satisfied with it.
I purchased this one for my brother, who loves to cook and loves new gadgetry.
Mission accomplished: we're both very happy with our purchase.
Just a note, when considering pressure cookers, look for stainless steel.
It cooks better, cleans better, feels more secure.
This seems to be a high quality product at a very reasonable price.
It quickly cooks two or three pounds of chicken for salads, sandwiches, or freezing.
Cook a pork roast with your favorite barbeque sauce in 30-45 minutes and enjoy pulled pork sandwiches infused with the flavor of the sauce.
This would be a great tool for the cook who likes make- ahead meals and stocking the freezer for quick-reheating weekday dinners.
Get the stainless steel model to avoid the reaction of aluminum to acidic foods.
all the reviews are really good which led my purchase.
after three uses, i found the quality is not any superior than my previous pressure cooker.
i give a four star rating for its quality and three star for its price.
We love the Stainless Steel pressure cooker, instead of the aluminum pressure cookers that are apt to leave contaminates in your food.
this is by far the best product for a family of two.
We enjoy the ease of use and easy clean up.
This is a very basic, high quality pressure cooker.
There are no &#34;frills&#34; (does such a thing exist on such a utilitarian appliance?), but it will suit your needs perfectly.
It is large, and can fully cook beans in 20 minutes instead of 2 days.
This is a simple but good pressure cooker.
I have owned the same model for several years.
I bought this one for my daughter and gave her a few &#34;cooking lessons&#34; with it.
This is a heavy gauge stainless steel pot!  The gaskets are thick and sturdy.
It has a lid locking mechanism that is a great safety feature!  It is a roomy 6 quart pot.
I owned another one for many years--it eventually had to be retired.
My daughter replaced it with a TFal brand pressure cooker which neither one of us was happy with.
I think my daughter learned not to buy any other brand of pressure cooker but a Presto.
The only down part is that you can;t see through the lid to notice if you are running low of liquid :(.
I had a Presto 6QT pressure cooker that was stolen by a Bimbo.
I got an 8QT foreign made pressure cooker but I liked the Presto, missed it and decided to get another one.
The old one was American made and the Stainless Steel at the top seemed to be a bit heavier.
This one  has a heavier bottom due to the sandwiched in clad aluminum.
The one Drawback is that it is Made in Communist China.
I can't detect any difference in the way that it cooks.
This is an investment every house cook should make.
The meats come out super duper tender and it takes no time at all.
I love my pressure cooker and this smaller size is perfect for my husband and I since it's just the two of us.
Aluminium eventually peels off and isn't as durable, plus it's toxic for you.
Oh, and cleaning is a snap!!! Dishwasher safe and even is  you do it by hand, nothing sticks :) good purchase.
What more can you say?  Replaced an old Presto pressure cooker that served over 30 years before the handle broke.
Steer clear of the cheap Mantra pressure cookers sold in Target.
Those ones are dangerous and are not UL approved!.
I bought this to quickly make stocks, and cook soups and vegetables.
It really does work, and makes yum-yum foods quickly, when one doesn't have the time to spend 3 hours making foods.
I'm impressed by the quality of the stainless steel, particularly the bottom, which is pretty thick.
I don't see any downsides to owning one.
Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately.
Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster.
It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook.Pressure cookers can be dangerous, so make sure to read the safety precautions.
Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity.
You do not want aluminum for health reasons.- We have been using this for more than 5 years.
Other pressure cookers (but more expensive) has a  non-removable pressure valve.
It is often get misplaced.- The rocker makes quite a bit noise.
Am a strong believer in pressure cookers and have used them for many years.
Have always used foreign made cookers because years ago they were better quality than the American made cookers.
Have a Magefesa and several Fagors and started having quality and service problems with them (see my review under Fagor's 6qt.
Finally, in desperation, decided to try a new American made Presto since they were now made of Stainless steel and had good ratings with Amazon.
Got one on sale from Amazon with free shipping and received it lickety-split in great shape (thanks Amazon).
Read the user's guide which walked me through an easy assembly and proceeded to cook a pot of beans.
Straight forward simplicity and as well engineered as one could ever expect and as a bonus, much easier to clean.
Kudos to current American products for a now great cooker.
If you like pressure cookers, give the Presto a try!!!.
This is my second Presto Pressure cooker, the first one had wooden handles, and was made of aluminum (still in service).
Aluminum not being compatible with Induction Cooking I got the Stainless Steel.
The encapsulated bottom creates that perfect heat distribution for searing and browning.
The new sealing ring is a wonder all by its self when compared to the ones of the 1940's.
Do I sound happy with this cooker, That's because I am.
The first thing I cooked was a pot of Pinto beans,(see photo) the pressure cooker cooked them 14 times faster than a conventional pan.
Clean up is a breeze, and to keep that just out of the box look I use Bar Keepers Friend.
I shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future.
This review was written assuming the reader knows a little bit about Pressure Cooking.
It's a simple design, a pot and lid.
I've been using them for 20 years and the expensive ones are no better than the Presto- Only an amateur cook would believe different.
The Prestos cook just as good and just as fast as the Rikons.
Save your money for the good espresso maker.
Now I'd absolutely hate to be without this fast and safe way to cook.My first experiment was a recipe for Chicken Cacciatore.
Three pounds of chicken cooked for 10 minutes (at 6000' altitude) and was fork-tender and delicious.
My next endeavor was a ham and bean soup, which cooked for 35 minutes without having to presoak the beans, and it turned out perfectly.
Next came a pot roast with potatoes, which cooked for 45 minutes starting partially frozen, and was perfect.
Then tried a chicken with plum sauce--again a nine-minute success.
The safety precautions are easy, and are fully described in the accompanying manual.I also recommmend Lorna Sass' book "Pressure Perfect", for beginners.
This book is a well-written primer on pressure cooking, with recipes that are reliable and carefully written.
The recipes have a degree of creativity, but are all things that "real people" eat.Happy cooking!.
Cleans up easily & love the fact it is stainless steel.
I also have the 8-quart stainless steel model by Presto and I don't like that one as much as this one.
I like the little rocker on top better because I know exactly how much pressure it has.
You just have to be careful when you do this.
That method takes about a minute, plus there's steam all over the place.
This size is just right for one or two people.
Reviewed many pressure cookers before deciding on this one.
While it requires a bit of assembly (handles and valve) these are minor issues.
Very well made cooker and the 64 page booklet included useful information and recipes.
Bought the 4 quart model since use for one person most of the time.
Not having used pressure cooker before appreciated the warnings and useful tips on how to use safely.
Like the fact that Presto has replacement seals when needed.
Obviously cooker is useless if do not have this seal and in time am sure will require replacement.
Buying one for my daughter as well who is busy career woman and wants to eat healthy and quickly.
Keeping nutrients and vitamins in the food a plus as is the savings in time cooking a good meal.
Easy to recommend this item.The instruction book that comes with this cooker is probably one of the best I have read in recent years.
At the same time it is also very detailed in the care, maintenance and handling of the cooker.
For example, it recommends replacing the seal and the safety plug once every two years.
Of course that probably depends on the amount of use and the care you take of the product.
In any case recommends replacing the safety plug when you replace the seal.
Both are available on Amazon but this will mean a continuing cost to use the product.
At the moment using Amazon Prime cost is about $15 for the pair of items or roughly $7.50 a year if replace every two years.
I do highly recommend anyone wanting to use the product to read the instructions very carefully and perhaps highlight the key items.
For example what foods to cook and more important what foods not to cook.
What level in the pot to use for various items depending on their expansion during cooking.
Various tips on how to clean (and how not to clean) the pot are very useful.
The instructions with this cooker are quite different.
They are important to use the product safely and to get the most value out of the product.
But an hour or so spent learning about he product will pay off in better cooking, shorter time spent cooking and more healthy eating.
I plan to show her mine and see if she will spend the time to learn the system.
Or give her mine and buy second for myself.
To me it is worth spending the time to learn about safely using this product but I can see that it is not for everyone.
It is not a pot you just pour water into, stick lid on and fire up the burners.
But once you learn how to take care of it and use it I think you will be extremely pleased with the cooking experience.
And the time spent learning and caring for the cooker will pay off in shorter and better cooking.
For those willing to invest a little time, bon appetite!.
This pressure cooker is made of heavy gauge steel, and you immediately feel the quality over the cheaper ones.
My wife uses it to make Beef Stew, and pork chops, and everything comes out tender and juicy, with no burning.
As many folks out there, including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers.
After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual, as if for a school test.
The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat, which is essential for good flavor.
The rubber gasket and stopper can't go in the dishwasher but the other parts can.
I also like that's it's stainless steel as opposed to aluminum.
I ordered the Presto Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker, I have nothing bad to say about the product or about Amazon.
I got my order pretty much on time...1 day late with free shipping.
I've ordered from Presto before with no complaints or with Amazon at this time.Mookie in Chicago.
My good friend was longing for a pressure cooker, so I thought I would surprise her with an early birthday present.
It is nice looking and has the same footprint as the 4 qt.
cooker (which is nice in a small kitchen).
She brought some beans she made in it to a cookout, and they were delicious.
I think it is a good value for the price.
I have always been afraid of pressure cookers because as a child my mother always banned me from the kitchen when she was using one.
Well, twenty some odd years later I finally purchased this one.
I read the instruction booklet and the first night made mashed potatoes and a pot roast.
It was so easy to use and easy to clean.
I am already planning on making BBQ pork ribs next!  Whoo-Hoo! Buy it! Use it!....but read the instructions first! Enjoy:-).
My mother bought me this nearly exact cooker many years ago, and it got lost in a move about 5 years ago.
I had used my old one for about 7 years and it was fine.
16 minutes later, drained the water off and used my handy dandy mixer and had the best creamiest fluffiest mashed potatoes ever.
IT WAS AND STILL IS A GREAT COOKER.
I've owned this pressure cooker for two months now and it's working like a dream.
model I bought thePresto 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerand love it just a bit more than this smaller size.
I've owned and used a 4 quart pressure cooker for 38 years and have been delighted that parts are still easy to get for it.
It is, however, well designed for cooking and the design well executed.
The handles (there are three) are not attached but are easily assembled using 5 phillips screws.
I used some heat resistant anti-seize compound sparingly on the threads.
The same as I use on the spark plugs in my car.
The lid interlock prevents the lid from being opened when the pot is pressurized.
It just takes a little more attention to alignment.
The lid sealing ring is thinner, but is actually easier to grease and install in the lid.
Finally, the gauge of the stainless steal is exactly as thick as my older 4 quart cooker although it appears thinner.
The sides, lid, and bottom of the older models are uniform thickness and are heavy enough to spread heat evenly.
This cooker now has a layer of aluminum to help spread the heat evenly across the bottom of the pot.
This layer is clad in stainless steel, so all exposed surfaces, most importantly, the bottom, are stainless steel.
The pot and lid are highly polished, but the bar code sticker was a little difficult to get off the side.
I can do things with a pressure cooker which cannot be done with a microwave!.
I bought this pressure cooker to make chili.
I've never owned or used a pressure cooker and was a bit nervous when I fired it up for the 1st time.
It heat up real quick using a ceramic glass cook top, and I was to able to brown the meat realitively quick.
The contruction of this pressure cooker looks very high quality and well made.
I think anyone who desires to cook should have a pressure cooker and this is a verygood one.
I received this a few days ago from Amazon.
This is a great pressure cooker and the size of 4 Quarts is ideal for me.
I made beef stew (cuban style) which is stew beef and potatoes with olives.
It came great and this 4 Quarts is big enough  for this recipe, with gravy and everything.
This is a great product for its quality and price.
Got this cooker about a month ago haven't stopped useing it yet don't know how I got along without it for so long.
glad i didn't get an electric one I saw on QVC.
It works on my induction cooktop well also.
A little delicate if bumped, and a little hard to clean,  but otherwise good.
My Mom always told me horror stories about pressure cooker, but I really wanted one after listening to my friend's successful experience with it.
I've had one before and someone from the moving company we used stole it.
We had used it for 10 years and it was still nice enough to take.
And now I find it on Amazon for $29.99! Can't beat the price.I hope the stew recipe is in the new owner's manual.
It was some of the best stew we've ever had.
I love meals from a pressure cooker way more than meals from a crock pot anyway.
Sturdy construction and the additional support tells you that it was made with quality and comfort in mind.
I doubt if you will find a 4 quart pressure cooker with the additional support handle.
Check this out before you buy another one.
I good some collards in this and it works just fine.
I prefer the stainless over aluminum.Presto is a good name and it's been around a while.
Actually, I prefer these first generation cookers where you have the jiggler on top that jingles when the pressure is built up.
Was looking around to see is there any way to cook some things faster and I found this Presto Pressure Cooker.
I can't imagine how we (my wife and me) did all cooking before! It is soooo faster and easier with this pressure cooker.
Made in China, but quality is outstanding and overall construction is very sturdy and will last long.
I feel it safe enought also, they are 3 different systems integrated so it will not blow in your hands.
With no doubt, must have item for every house.
I'll get 6-Quart Presto sometime soon to coock large quantities which I will pack using FoodSaver and store in the freezer.
It definitely worth every penny and I can't believe it cost only $30.
I was raised with Presto pressure cookers, and have used others.
I purchased the steamer for my daughter and myself,  and the lid for myself.
These products have been welcome additions to our cooking tools.
Do not be afraid to spend the extra money for them...they are well worth it!.
I was so delightfully surprised to see how quickly this pressure cooked cooked my meat and stews.
This pressure cooker packs a real punch by tenderizing my poultry in a short space of time.
Great value for such an awesome pressure cooker.
Presto 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure CookerThis pressure cooker has many positive points:  stainless steel, included rack for inside the cooker, and a good locking lid.
I've cooked beef, chicken, and pork with it, and it performs very well.
It's far superior to the aluminum one I had.
The recipe booklet had excellent suggestions so I can easily adapt my other favorite recipies to the pressure cooker.
Presto has been around for years and I had one in the way back but was a bit afraid to use a pressure cooker.
Now...many years later....I bought a new Presto and I don't know why I was ever nervous.
This one is so simple and the instructions could not be more clear.
I especially wanted it to cook dried beans.
Not only are they much cheaper than canned beans they actually taste better.
The thing is holding up and has not been discontinued yet so we are quite satisfied with it.
I found this pressure cooker to be everything I wanted.
Great size, easy to use, easy to clean up.
I purchased this for my mother who loves to cook (for everyone).
It helps her cut the cost of using her oven.A good buy.
I have never seen any signs of the metal layers splitting, the pot warping, and there has been no denting from handling and washing.
Pressure cookers prepare these things quickly and make them taste like they've been cooking forever.
This basic model is fine for weekly use in my household.
I am definitely curious about newer types of cookers, but personally wasn't ready to pay more money for something I wasn't sure I would need.
I hate to cook and have never used a pressure cooker.
After reading all the helpful reviews I made the leap and bought this one.
I LOVE IT!!!  It is not hard at all and I can't believe how fast it cooks.
I bought this 6-qt stainless pressure cooker and have been very pleased with it.
It is 'induction' ready, too, for those who cook by this method.
It finally bit the dust so I decided to try a stainless steel cooker.
This one is taller, but not as wide, as my previous cooker.
However, it is plenty big to hold a 3-4 pound chicken or roast, which is what I usually cook in it.
So far I really like it - and no problems yet with hardware rusting like I've read in a few reviews.
I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a not-too-big pressure cooker!.
I am very happy with the quality, price, and versatility of this pressure cooker.
I have made some great tasting quick meals in a pinch, and use it as a 6 quart sauce pan as well.
As with any pressure cooker be careful with moving it!.
6 quart is the perfect size for beans and lintels.
If we were omnivores we'd need a bigger pot, but for vegans, 6 quart is perfect.
Stainless steel is high quality and supposedly healthier than aluminum.
I was so glad I got this pressure cooker and use it fairly often.
I don't know why it took me so long to get one.
I look a lot of lamb and beef , this makes the job quick and easy.
1 min pressure and meat is tender but maintains flavor.
Needs rubber change in 3-6 months depending on usage.
This is nothing fancy, but it works wery well.
You can't open it if it's under pressure because it has a lock by the handle (safety feature).
The Kuhn-Rikon also allows less water to escape.
I keep both of them but I haven't used the presto for 4 months now.
Considering I bought the Presto in 1999, it's amazing that it works perfectly even though it got heavy use.
I even put the rubber seal and the lid in the dishwasher every time and it still held up.
It's my backup cooker now as I can't let go of something that still works fine.
This is my first pressure cooker and I really like it.
For this price, it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much.
Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker.
I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it.
As long as it is under pressure, you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product, it is overly large for my needs.
Because the pressure cooker is so fast, there's really no need to make large batches of things.
I never really thought I would be writing a review to praise a pressure cooker.
This cooker is a pleasant surprise, because none of these problems happen with this Presto.
I simply dumped lentils, carrots, peas and pearl onions altogether into this cooker and boom, after 30 minutes, the lentils soup was ready.
Now, you may think what is so special about this.
It blended the lentils and vegetables in such a beautiful way that it was just ready to eat.
So, that means, nothing was spilling during the cooking process.
It is the most controlled and well-designed cooker I have ever used in my whole life.
I am guessing the cool down time is also part of the cooking process.
The instruction/cook book that comes with it is very right on and helpful.
Very east to clean, make sure you take out the rubber gasket from the lid and clean it well after each use.
I have read that pressure cooking retains more nutrients in the food than any other type of cooking.
Makes sense because so little steam or anything escapes.
I have owned and used this cooker for several years.
It is the perfect size for my 2 person household.
Many empty nesters and those with small kitchens will find this a terrific product.The accessories make this pot multifunctional and expand its usefulness.
The options are unlimited and so you are not stuck with only pot roast or stew.
You can even bake  cheesecake in the pressure cooker.
Many hardware stores (mom and pop as well as large chains) carry thePresto Pressure Cooker Sealing Ring/Overpressure Plug Pack (4 & 6 Quart).
I needed a 4-quart stainless steel sauce pan and a stovetop pressure cooker.
I already own an 8-quart electric pressure cooker but wanted something smaller for the smaller meals.
So far I have used it as a pressure cooker 2x, searing meat 1x, and sauteing unions 2x.
I'm glad I went this route instead of buying this Presto cooker and shelling out another $50-60 for another stainless steel sauce pan.
It replaced a broken belt in the Eureka c2000 series upright, and after month later it still works.
Although the description says Genuine Eureka belts, they came in generic plastic bag.
They seem to wear about as well as the original belt.
While you're at it, stock up on bags, too.
I have tried generic belts in the past and most have suffered from premature failure and "burnout".
Some have even cracked and broke as a result of the heat and friction created when the motor is running.
It all depends on the type--and quality--of the rubber folks.
There is a reason manufacturers recommend sticking with genuine replacement parts.
Though generic belts/bags *may* fill the void, my experience has always been less than positive.
These fit my 30+ year old Eureka upright perfectly and make it run like new once again.
I also refuse to part with this machine because I firmly believe it outperforms many of the newer models on the market today.
What's more, the maintenance and design of these older vacuums are such that you can usually do the work yourself.
If you understand how these vacuums work and are mechanically inclined, they are virtually maintenance free.
There is literally nothing that can go wrong on these machines except the belt and the occasional light burnout.
I generally need to change my mine roughly every 2-3 months depending on use.
Also, carpets with tassels and loose threads wreak havoc on these things--get rid of them.
Overall, I'm quite pleased and hope that Eureka continues to make these available for the long term.
Do what they are supposed to, work well with my vacuum.
Don't kid yourself into buying non-name brand belts.
These belts are not joined horizontally which would cause them to break much, much more quickly.
They're bonded vertically all the way around which makes them very strong.
It's worth a few extra pennies to buy something that's going to last much longer.
In the past I have taken my vacuum to a vac shoppe to have belts replaced.
Decided to try it myself, but couldn't find the belts in local stores for my vacuum.
These work and it was easy to do.
I got this for my old Vac.Fits fine, works, i have a spare, life is good.
I ordered this belt for my vacuum and it turned out to be the wrong one.
GoVacuum customer service researched the correct belt and offered to not only give me a refund, but send the correct belt free of charge.
Very nice people to deal with and extremely knowledgeable about products.
I've been vacuuming for over 40 years and I enjoy trying new products.I have a myriad of machines, from $100.00 to $1400.00.
No matter what I try, Eureka makes the best vacuuming products and this particular model is best for carpets.
It's easy use is a huge plus for me - no need to disassemble, re-arrange, clean or empty trays, reassemble, etc.
I just tap the 'On' button, release the handle and go.
I'll buy one of these for every floor in the house and keep each plugged in and ready to go.
I've only had this vacuum for 2 months but it's everything the other reviews said it was.
I have two long hair cats and it has no problem with all of the shedding.
Assembly is a cinch, took me under 1/2 hour.
Returned my Oreck in favor of this one.
It still runs, but the motor bearings are worn out.
This one appeared almost identical to the original so I couldn't resist ordering it.
The shape of the motor housing has been modernized a bit but most of the machine is identical, wheels, handle, belt, bag, etc.
It is reasonably quiet, quite light, and is inexpensive.
(The bag-less is better on carpets.) In addition, it works well for use in our RV.
This vacuum really sucks....but in a GOOD way.The motor is plenty strong.
You can actually see it pick up the carpet.
You'll probably need to replace the handle before the motor gives out.Overall, I'm glad I bought it.
The $ (dollar) value of the vacuuming power is awesome.
It is a great advantage to not have additional attachments that will take away from the main vacuum.
At the value of this vacuum, one can afford an independent and highly effective smaller hand-vac if hose attachments are desired.
The long cord (20 feet or so) doesn't retract, you just wind it over hooks on the handle.
It's also a lot less noisy than my smaller bagless.
It comes in a flat box, minor assembly required.
My original vacuum had a hepa filter on it that needing replacing and apparently the manufacturer no longer made them.
I ordered this vacuum because all it needed was a bag.
It cleans the carpet just as well as the old model.If you just need to vacuum the floor, this model is great.
Great to be able to get replacement parts for my machine.
Have enough to last me for guite awile now.
They're easy to replace, and they do a good job filtering the dirt out.
They fit the model of vacuum I have and do a good job of filtration.
They fit the vacuum cleaner and they retain dust and dirt.
What else is there? They work OK, in other words,.
These are vacuum cleaner bags from the original equipment manufacturer.
They are inexpensive, they fit, they work, they make you happy.
Been useing these vacuum bags for many years they are good quality and the price here was very good wold recommend to others.
Since I didn't write at least 20 words the first time, I'll more fully recommend these bags.
a convertible and a concept two (which I think is from the 80's, and still is wonderful) so I use a lot of bags.
I would much rather throw a bag away than have to empty that cylinder every day.
Well, since I found that I can buy them locally for the same price, or the Arm and H.
Hopefully I have covered the subject well enough for Amazon.
Just did a review for a different bag from Hoover & as stated there they work, did the job and no complaints on my part.
I am a Hoover fan and avid user of their vacuums.
Therefore I always purchase Hoover Vacuum Bags where I know I will get the same quality of bag as I have in the vacuum.
These never disappoint and a great prize on Amazon.
I don't know what else is there to say about a vacuum cleaner bag, but this one is a good one.
Easier for me to purchase from Amazon than to go out to the stores.
The bags were received promptly and are everything I needed (with the exception of 1 million dollars).
I love buying things I use constantly from Amazon instead of searching through stores looking for different items.
When you get a bit older and knees and arthritis bother you,  Amazon is heaven sent.
These bags work perfectly for my old Hoover vacuum.
Bought enough so I won't run out for quite some time.
There's not much to say about vacuum cleaner bags; if you need them, you buy them.
These bags are durable and easy to install and remove.
I've used a number of them and never had an issue of bags breaking or leaking.
They are allergen filtration bags and trap dust mites, mold and cat dander.
Well, it's hard to write a review about a vacuum cleaner that you honestly don't love.
The bags are murder to install in the cleaner.
The Hoover F4300 Floormax Supreme I ordered Dec.
I have not used it to polish, but I'm sure it would do a good job.
I just have a lot of hard floor to scrub.
Blessings to you in all your floor maintenance adventures.
And it has lasted for years through a lot of abuse.
But it is light weight and buffs my wood floors nicely.
I am actually looking forward to when I can use it.
The price is also well within range for the average person.
I have used Hoover products regularly for most of my adult life.
A bit tricky to put together, tube to the water dispenser didn't fit right, but I rigged it up and it works fine.
No other alternative in this price range, I'm overall happy.Mike.
This is a GREAT, light weight cleaning machine.
I'm cleaning a house to put on the market and this little machine has already saved countless hours.
The entire lower level is tile and the upper level is carpet with a linoleum floored kitchen.
I got the tile cleaned in no time with this machine, it did a beautiful job cleaning and restoring the tile to like new condition.
I have started cleaning the carpet and am very pleased with the results.
The carpet brushes get right up to the baseboard so there are no dirty carpet edges.
I also cleaned the old linoleum in the kitchen and was surprised how beautiful this old floor actually is.
I expect to be using this buffer for years to come.
My Mom bought me one of these from Walmart when I was in middleschool.
its lasted half a lifetime and still doesnt even have a strach on it.
I bought four of these for $27 each at Home Depot.
I carry them in the back of my pickup truck when I need tools and toss them in the garage when I don't need them.
It makes it easy to load my truck in a hurry.What I like about them.1.
Lid is fairly sturdy--you can sit on one if you are careful.4.
Having a bunch of them, means they all are the same height if you want to build a platform.5.
Locking handles have a solid secure feel to them.7.
With only one handle locked it act like a hinge--you can open it from one side.8.
You can write on the lids with a Sharpie pen.9.
I've had something similar but larger and found it was too hard to lift when loaded.
These are a good size.What I didn't like.1.
I was going to return it, but they were out.
I can repair it with a drill and a cotter pin--so I decided to keep it anyway.2.
Hard to find more locally.I'd buy more of these if I could find them.
I use them to sort tools and activities by type.
For example, I use one for power tools, one for fiberglass materials, one for general tools.
I'd like one for camping gear.I'd give it five stars except for the one defective one I purchased.
I'd recommend buying them locally and carefully inspecting them to be sure you have ones that are defect free.
For transport or storage these can't be beat.
I use them for power tool storage and another for camping stuff,.
We purchased two Action Packer cargo boxes to fit on our Valley Cargo Carrier.
The 48-gallon and the 32-gallon boxes fit perfectly side-by-side on the carrier.
We expected the boxes to be rain-proof and waterproof, and they do not disappoint.
We leave them outside when we camp, through some severe thunderstorms and still no rain gets in.
But it is certainly an option for those who want it, and looks pretty easy to accomplish.So why 4 stars instead of 5? The handles.
I wish that the handles were deeper or perhaps had folding handles.
The boxes are difficult to carry when heavily packed.
I might try to drill out holes to add rope handles, but that water tight issue has stopped me so far.
Other than that one detail, these cargo boxes are perfect for us.
This box is absolutely perfect for what I intended.
Maybe even a bit of overkill on my part (this thing is super solid) but better safe than sorry.
The latch hole might be a bit tricky with a different style of lock.
Not impossible, but a heckuva lot harder to use than the cable.
OMG!!! this thing is HUGE!!!I just love these things.
I bought this to mount on a bike trailer from CycleRevolution in Oregon.
This was perfect!It clamps down well, is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time.
Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping.Otherwise, its a small, durable storage box.
Bliss to Iraq and so far it has held up 10X better then those flimsy foot lockers that they sell at the exchange.
Still locked, still in one piece, lid still closes.
Looks great, and everything inside is in one piece.
Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it.
As built now, you will need two people to handle this huge bin.
Would also help if the handholds were deeper.
Overall, very good.Update 11/22/11:  Not as durable as I had originally thought.
And yes, the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance.
Still, it's a decent box that continues to function okay.
Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable.
I fit a metric crap-ton of stuff in this thing.
Use it for a table when you're camping.
If you drop it in the water it will leak, but otherwise this is the best tub ever.
I bought it for the back of my daughter pick up truck (dodge Dakota).
My only disappointment was that it wasn't long enuf to kinda touch each side of the back.
I was hoping for it to fit snug but otherwise it's exactly what I was looking for just not long enuf.
I purchased it to store my hunting clothes.
It has plenty of room for bulky down jackets and insulated coveralls.
This is a great size, It fits, snugly, in the rear of our Sedona van with all the seats in place.
It is a nice size I carrly my tirechains, washer fluid, oil, stc.
Plus it looks very nice with our grey interior,.
Whatever issue the previous reviewer's had it has now been resolved.
This is a great product and came exactly as described!.
I bought an ActionPacker box exactly like this one many, many (20?) years ago to serve as a newspaper box on my front steps.
Wanted a storage box for my automotive products and rags.
It fits just fine in my smaller 2015 Honda Fit, solid build and keeps things orderly as I like it.
Its big, but you need room for a bunch of products, this is a good choice.
OTOH, if a tablespoon full of water is something you can tolerate, then it'll do that OK.
I suggest drilling weep holes in the bottom.
It worked for me carrying camping gear where I can live with a *little* bit of water in a rainstorm.
I have to say that I have this box mounted on the back of my KLR650 and it is freaking awesome.
Hurry and buy this now for your KLR.
We've used a couple smaller ActionPackers for camping.
Got this one for a "camp kitchen." Should have room for all the gear plus dry goods, etc.
These things are great--can be used as a seat or table.
Tough enough to deter many pesky small critters and should stay dry in most storms.
They stack very nicely and are lockable (2 padlocks not included), if additional security is important to you.
I have looked for a while for a wall mount fan and saw this at our Credit Union behind the cashiers.
I purchased it through Amazon and it's PERECT for my home office.
Very quiet, three speed and small enough to NOT blow papers around.
I don 't understand why they don't sell these in stores???.
The end result is that there is no power cord showing (just like in the picture (where the power cord must have been removed)).
The Leviton 688 and fan mounting plate also had to be modified just slighting in order to accommodate each other.
This is just the fan I have been looking for.
I have another 16&#34; of the same brand and they are very well made and I expect I will have many years of service.
I live in an apartment and it gets super hot sometimes.
I have one of these in the kitchen and one in the bedroom, both positioned next to windows to blow in fresh air.
I use the one in the kitchen when it gets hot from cooking, the one in the bedroom when it gets hot in the night.
I have no complaints about these, I will probably get another for the living room when it gets warmer outside.
Wall-mount fans are so practical, yet difficult to find.
This fan was the perfect solution to keeping cool in a small office with absolutely no space to place a fan otherwise.
However, read the instructions because, while easy, mounting is not necessarily intuitive.
In a small space (my office is approx.
9' x 10'), the lowest setting circulates the air plenty.
It runs quiet and has an extra-long cord to minimize the chance you will have to use an extension cord.
It includes a convenient cord, one tug on which turns the fan off.
The fan head adjusts up and down by hand-clicking into one of several pre-set positions (nothing to loosen).
The oscillation knob is in the traditional position on top of the fan, so keep that in mind when mounting.
If you mount it too high, it will be hard to reach.
Not an issue for me, because I always let it oscillate.
This is the second fan of this model I have bought and have not been disappointed yet.
I have had an older model Eureka mighty mite canister vacuum for over ten years.
I have had quite a few vacuums over the years where models have been discontinued and it becomes virtually impossible to find bags.
The new hose is much softer and tends to kink easily.
I still like the product but have to deduct one star for the hose quality.
She says it works great is lightweight and easy to move around.
We have only tile and wood floors so this is the best little vacuum for us.
I have owned a LOT of vacuums in my day, both canister and upright and some of them were really expensive.
But this little Vac has the most powerful suction of anything I have every owned.
Even more powerful than my old Dyson!  I could hardly believe it when I turned it on.
So there's no hepa filters, or bagless, or retractable cord or fancy light or carpet beating head.
And you can hit it with your foot so when you go from the rugs to the floors you don't have to stop.
There is also a thing on the handle to open up so that it reduces the suction on the head.
Before I knew what it was I sucked my hand in and pinched my finger.
But it will let you cut down on your suction.All in all, I'd say this is well named and an excellent buy.
It seems well made too and I hope to get a lot of wear out of it.
My husband had one for years and it finally died.
He was very pleased when we were able to find another one to replace the old one.
Mind you this is only one of probably 5 different shop vacuums he owns.
Like cooking you need the right tool for particular jobs.
Disposing the bag keeps all the dirt together.
This is a very lightweight, all plastic vacuum - not really a true canister vac.
I purchased this vac solely for use in vacuuming my automobiles and it is perfect for that.
The unit is extremely light - perhaps only four pounds or so - meaning that it can easily be lifted and moved around.
As well, the small head attachment is double-headed.
The only tool that is lacking somewhat is the narrow wand used for getting into tight places.
The wand is designed with a notch cut up into it, so you cannot achieve full suction.
The bag is large enough that you could vacuum dozens of full sized cars before having to change it.
The unit functions perfectly for such use, but it is a bit noisy and gets very hot from even a couple of minutes use.
It is a very light duty vacuum and not one that I would consider using extensively in my house.
Fed-Ex just dropped it at my door a matter of minutes ago.
Thought I would give it quick test on the kitchen floor.
Before I realized it, the entire 2 bedroom apartment was clean in a couple of minutes.
It whizzed across the ceramic tile floors and short nap throw rugs.
Who knew this kind of power could be had for 65 dollars?  Excellent value.
How can such a light weight vacuum have so much power?  It took me longer to write this review then vacuum the entire apartment.
I ordered this vacuum nearly a year ago and absolutely LOVE it.
BUT the hose that came with it was flimsy and would collapse, thus limiting suction.
I contacted Eureka about this and they shipped me a new hose which is much stronger.
I was very impressed with the customer service.
We own a cleaning company and use the commercial version of this little vacuum almost exclusively.
It cost less than half of the commercial model but had the smaller motor.
It is a large filter that attaches over the exhaust port at the rear of the vacuum.
I've only seen one model that takes it although there may be others by now.
I like this vacuum and am glad I purchased it.
The price was good and for hard floors it it easy to use and is quite powerful.
It is hard to clear it but the suction hole in the handle helps enable you to "fish out" whatever is in there.
I wish that the handle was not bent.
It may make it easy to hold but the tendency for clogging is greatly increased.
You cannot beat the price and for hard surfaces it works better than any upright I have owned.
For the carpet in my bedrooms I do use an upright for so I would not suggest using this for plush carpet.
However it does work well on area rugs and low pile carpets.
Let's be honest: this is an inexpensive vacuum and yet, it lives up to everything the manufacturer says it does.
With the recent move, I didn't want to spend more than a $100 dollars but also didn't want to regret my purchase.
After carefully reading the reviews here - I decided on the Eureka.Here are some pros:1.
Very long extension - can reach high places easily4.
The hose where it connects to the vacuum rotates, creating smooth movement5.
The extension tubes sometimes don't stay attached while vacuuming (can be annoying)2.
It's still in the new stage for us, but so far I like it.
Very easy to use with all the adjustments.
I'd rate it a 5, but the parts are plastic and I'm not sure yet, if they will last.
I will update this review in a month or so.
This is one of the best vacuums I've ever come across.
My mom had an old Hoover that she got in the 1950s, and she had it for 30 years.
It would probably still be working if she hadn't ditched it for a newer model.
That was a super heavy-duty machine that could have taken care of twenty houses a day if need be.
I can reach all the way up to my 10-ft high ceilings with ease.
It grabs ALL the dust in corners and the attachments actually work getting into tight spaces.
I expect I'll still be using it in ten years, which, in this day and age, I can't say about very many things.
I inherited an expensive Hoover from my MIL (from the 1980s) and it was crap.
I did a better job sweeping with a broom! This little Mighty Mite could outdo that one any day of the week.
It also does a great job on upholstery and on the car.
I have cats and it's great for getting up shed hair, it's fantastic for crumbs and larger particles.
I've not had any clogs so far.Highly recommended.
For the money, this is a fantastic deal.
I use a Shark upright for area rugs and it does a great job.
Dragging them around was like often like trying to drag a reluctant mule out of the barn during feeding time.
Plus the hoses could be like wrestling a boa constrictor.
The Mighty Mite is light and easy to carry, follows along easily when pulled, and the hose is easy to handle.
The hose swivels easily on both ends and it is long, light, and easy to deal with.
The vac sits up politely while you coil it around the cord holders so it's not a hassle to wind in place.
Suction is good for such a small vac and it does a fine job on bare floors.
The bags are a decent size.CONS:  Suction control is in an awkward place near the handle so it's easy to accidentally adjust.
Wrapping a piece of blue tape (the handy girl's secret weapon) around it solved that problem.
The attachments are a joke as you might expect from a $56 vacuum.
However, this is easily solved by purchasing a high quality floor brush, duster brush, and upholstery cleaner.
I had several I had saved from previous vacs and they fit just fine on the round end of the wands.
You can get adapters if the attachments are too big for the wand.
You will probably NOT be happy with this vac if you have wall to wall carpet.
It does not have a powered carpet head so you can only do superficial cleaning of low pile rugs.
The cord is fairly short:  20 feet, so you'll have to move the plug more often than one with a longer hose.
Even if I had to replace it every year, the price would make that not prohibitive.
After our quite old Eureka canister vacuum had finally gone belly up, we were looking for an appropriate replacement.
Because this was needed primarily for cleaning hardwood floors, there were a few critical criteria.
It had to be strong, yet compact in size.
It should not be too loud, and the tool assortment should be appropriate for floors and vacuuming cat hair of various furniture items.
Finally, we did not want to have to mess around with cleaning out bagless vacuum containers.
The Eureka Mighty Mite 3670 came through with flying colors on all fronts.
It produces a powerful vacuum, easily maneuverable, convenient for storing, the noise is not too bad, and a good price.
This vacuum cleaner gives an excellent value, and, certainly, gets the job done that we bought it for.
Just got this to use for cars, garage (blow feature), and bare floors.
We are both tall and this has a good length of the rigid hose, and the flex hose, also of the cord.
We have a Dyson for carpets, but this is easier to handle, and for the price good performance, especially for hardwood, stairs, garage use.
Good price and light weight, makes it easy to store and carry out to the garage to clean the cars.
Nice long wands for ceiling cleaning (lots of spiders around here).
Drives my dogs crazy but what the heck, they get a treat later.
I chose this canister vacuum after reading the reviews.
I have an Oreck for my carpeting and am very happy with it.
It picks up dirt, lint, and dust with no problem.
I have not found the length of the cord to be a problem.
For a larger home, you will probably have to switch electric outlets.I rated the vac as a 4.
The crevice attachment was fine, but the combined brush and flat attachment was an odd configuration.
When doing my baseboards, I had to concentrate on keeping the brush end positioned correctly.
Also, the attachments are small in the area they cover.Another thing that may aggravate some folks is that this canister vac is very light.
I would not recommend this vac for large carpeted areas.
This is the best vaccumn cleaner I 've ever used.
Its not heavy and I'm way up in years.
It has a great  suction, it even cleans your baseboards.
However, the local vacuum cleaner store insisted that I examine the features before storming out of the store, so reluctantly I did.
I did purchase the better quality dusting brush as an acccessory.
And, my Dyson power-head for fur removal from upholstry fits the wands perfectly.
(Not so lucky with the Bosch I just gave away)Suction is excellent.
Wands simply pull apart -no tabs to lock together- which makes it faster when you want to add a brush.
Wands are made of plastic rather than metal & I've found they attract dog fur through electrostatic energy.
So, I gave them a spraying with "Static Guard" & voila - no more fur sticking to them!This little guy maneuvers easily & is lightweight.
It stores easily as well because of it's small size.
Bags are small, but they hold an entire houseful of fur so I only have to change them after one cleaning.
I've been spoiled by my other vacs which had them.
The cord is much longer than the one on the Bosch I just got rid of.
It's long enough to enable me to do two rooms, however, it's cumbersome to wrap underneath the vacuum when done.
It's an amazing little vac without all the expensive frills of higher priced units and does an amazing job for a tiny price tag.
I think I'm going to keep this one around for a LOOOOOONG time.
I wanted a small hand vac to get into tight places and to suck up bugs from the windows.
Mighty Mite was recommended and had good customer service rating plus the price was far below what I would have paid locally.
I have used a Eureka for years, so didn't hesitate to buy this one.
The vac works great but the head is poorly designed--I wish they would have kept the old configuration.
Maybe I just need to get used to it.
Our old one was a workhorse and served us well for many years.
This vacuum has great suction for a low end unit.
It arrived with a dented box, but everything in side was oaky.
The only feature I miss is a cord retractor.
So light and easy to move around, it's perfect.
These are very hard to find at local stores for some reason.
I didn't expect too much for an inexpensive canister vacuum.
I was purchasing to vacuum cat and dog hair on my carpeted stairs and to vacuum my car.
This little "mighty mite" packs a big punch.
Superb suction, compact and light weight, but does not feel flimsy.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a canister vacuum.
Absolutely love my Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum!The suction is great, unbelievable.
There has been a lot written on this vac so I won't repeat what I have already read.
The main things I can add are that 1) to beware that the inlet where the hose attachment is has no one way valve.
If you stand it on it's rear no problem.
2) the power switch is under a plastic bar which bends when you press it.
That means that some day the bending will eventually break the plastic bar and the switch will be exposed.
It is recessed and you would have to poke your finger into the hole once this breaks and it will.
Plastic only bends so many times before breaking.
Bad design, but for about $65 how can you complain.
I have all hardwood floors with cats and there are dust bunnies everywhere.
I think the cord length is perfect too.I just don't know when to change the bag!.
minus a star because the cord is manual.
It is a little awkward to move around, but I've managed to work with it.
I've had one of these for a couple of months and so far, so good.
The long hose is good for reaching under things but makes it a bit of a pain to store.
I think the plastic it is made of is a bit cheap and I wonder if it will hold up over time.
I didn't want to spend a lot though and think it's a good product for the price.
But good suction, a color I thought I'd mind but I don't, easy to assemble, stores easily, and does the job for a small apartment.
I only ever buy stand up vacuums but this one had great reviews and I thought, what the heck.
I hardly ever notice it trailing along behind me, and it has a really good suction! I love the long hose and different attachments.
Whereas I used to just vacuum my rugs, now my cleaning routine consists of me vacuuming everything in my house.
It goes from hardwood to carpet easily, the bags last a long time.
There are 2 cons on this product in my opinion.
1) the cord does not retract, and 2) the hose is somewhat thin and occasionally kinks.
It does seem the hose won't last long but I can't imagine it is much to replace.
Overall I like it, it does a great job cleaning the carpet and tile floors of my apartment.
The cord is long and the long handle makes it easy to get cob webs or in narrow spaces.
One only complaint is that it is a bit loud, but for the price and performance it is a small complaint.
This is a very handy, well made canister vacuum.
We had an older version that lasted for many years, we purchased a new one for my mother, then needed a new one for ourselves.
My law office is 2,000 square feet of carpeted and tiled floors.
We have an upright and a steam vac for the carpets and they do fine.
But for sucking up loose junk on tile and in between tiles it is great.
It is also great for cleaning drapes (floor to ceiling) and hard to reach spots because of the long wand extensions.
Wanted it for getting pet hair around the corners of the floors and the stairs.
Don't have to stoop over to use it.
This new little wunderkind is worth its weight in gold.
Not only arrived when you said, this NEWEureka works really, really well.Thank you all for being great to work with!  Ding.
This powerful little light-weight machine cleans my house in no time.
When the bag gets full, pop out that one and replace it with a new one.
My house is about 1500 square feet with only one small area rug.
But the floors with dog and cat hair, dust bunnies and garden bits tracked in are clean in no time.
Then I vacuum the big velvet couch and other furniture, dog pillows, and even the cob webs that appear now and again.
My last Mighty Mite lasted for twelve years, the previous one for eight.
Hard to look at another brand for vacuuming for me.
It is very powerful in such a small unit.
It is surprised me at the first time when I used it.
There is a small vent hole in conjunction of the handler.
I accedentally put my left hand over the hole (I should xeal the hole first).
The vacuum suck force made a bruise on my hand.The unit is very convinient (portable).
I used it for the hard wood floor and on my Mini-Van.
I do not need to buy another one for my mini-van.
The attachments are great for removing dirt in higher areas i.e.
The model number I am reviewing is the 3670G.
Fairly basic, but with all the necessary tools.
The hose is long enough to reach the ceiling without effort.
The suction is adjustable and far superior to that of an upright with attachments, which is exactly what I wanted.
Works very well on bare floor and carpet too.
Note, this does not have a beater bar, and don't think it was really designed for carpet only.
So, it is not going to take dog hair, for instance, out of a carpet as well as a regular upright.
For the purpose I need it for, it is wonderful.My only complaint is the cord, which is stored/wrapped on the bottom of the machine.
I recently put in hardwood floors and was looking for a light vacuum to use that would be quick to get the job done.
The cord doesn't retract, which is kind of annoying, but I'm willing to out up with that.
I need something to reach the ceiling easily - this fits the bill very well.
This vacuum cleaner is so much easier to use than the one it replaced.
The HEPA filter it had was a royal pain in the ...., it would clog up in not time at all.
After the first bag filled up I pulled it out and replaced it with a new one, simple, easy, done in no time at all.
It is so easy to maneuver it around the house you almost forget its following you.
This vacuum cleaner is one I should have bought in the first place, not to mention the amount of money it would have saved me.
Very pleased with this unit, and also the super service from Amazon.
I bought this because I have bare floors with just a few scatter rugs.
It works great on the floors, and is easy to move around, with a very long cord.
The thing we don't like is that the cord is not retractable, my husband thought that it was.
I have the suction back!First of all if you read the directions, there is something called a "blower" on the vacuum.
You need to disconnect the hose and re-attach it to the blower on the back of the vacuum.
here I found some clogged hair and lint.
I used some needle nose pliers to pull out the clogged debris.
Then I detached the hose and carefully used a straightened wire hanger to see if I could push anything up to the nozzle.
The clog was very small but had a huge impact on the suction.
The hose is kind of cheap, so you have to be careful/gentle with it.
The vacuum is awesome for specific purposes, but trying to use it on carpet and more intense jobs will wreck the vacuum.
I really like it for the hard wood floors though.
I had given it one star, until I unclogged the hose, now I realize it does work and you can fix the suction issues.
But you have to keep this vac just for specific purposes.
I figure that it served its purpose and just ordered a new one.
Not my dream machine, but certainly does the job.
good power and easy to maneuver compactaccessories are a bit flimsy -deserves 3 3/4 stars because of flimsy accessories.reasonable price.
I have all hard wood floors and love this.
The hoses and cords are really long too.
I can vacuum really fast with this, very good suction.
The woman who cleans for me, is happy as well, since this does the heavier jobs that need to get done.
Works on carpet or a small change and back to bare floors.
The bags are large for a small canister vac, they are VERY powerful (no comparison between this and the Oreck canister)!!!.
I also use this for my car-great for cleaning cars and in garages.
I also use one for cleaning the wood floor on my screen porch.
Would replace them again with this in a minute.
I volunteer my time cleaning at a cat rescue.
I run this vac almost two hours straight cleaning cement basement floors, and carpeted cat perches/furniture.
The machine can get hot, but it still has a powerful suction to a concrete floor with the vac head attachment.
Even with a overly full bag it still has suction and the cord is long.
I just wish the bags were larger though, as they fill up fast with cat hair and litter.
:) I do not suffer from elbow fatique considering how long I am using the machine.
The only issue I had was when a tiny cat toy got caught in the plastic pipe at the connection to the corrigated hose.
This happens quite often and the person who owns the vac fixed it by disconnecting those pieces.
This vacuum can handle being run hard and still works great.
I purchased one for my mother in law because its so easy to use, carry and to change the bags.
I think this Eureka Mighty Mite vac is better then the expensive mini Riccar I own.
We have a nu8mber of vacuums since we are compulsive cleaners.
This was a replacement t for a similar one we had owned for years.
Better than our last one which had seemingly died of old age.
affordable and efficient little giantIt is easy to use and really picks up dirt, feathers and hairI recommend it to any  one.
My unit is an older model which is called &#34;The Boss&#34; but is the very same as this.
Mine has EXCELLENT suction and I don't mind that it is a little noisy.
Mine is used for cleaning up around the woodstove.
It does an excellent job of sucking up ash and wood particles of various sizes.
I don't understand the negative reviews, unless these people received &#34;lemons&#34;.
I would highly recommend this vac for small jobs, I don't think it was intended to be used for  whole house vacuuming.
This is one of the best household products I ever bought.
This is a very powerful little unit and makes all those hard to clean areas a snap to clean.
I don't know what I did without this before.
I now can get all the floor corners and ceiling corners that were so hard to get with a regular Vacuum and attachments.
And, you can vacuum your car with this too.
You can't go wrong with this canister vac.
My wife had one of these from 10 or so years ago.
It was still going, but a rough step son had broken the plastic rods, etc.
My wife loves all of the Eureka products.
This is the second one of these that I bought.
I took the origional to use in my shop and garage and the new one is for the house.
They are powerful and dependable little portable vacs.
We used to have 4 which we used in our janitorial business and I don't think they can be beat.
Mighty Mite is a good name for this vacuum.
It has great suction and gets the job done for a price that can't be beat.
I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood.
I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off.
My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose.
That sliding mechanism is great, but it's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum.
So, from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand.
That said, i can always slap a piece of tape on that part, because otherwise this vac is so good.
We needed a new vacuum and I could not decide on what i really wanted.
So far this thing has been pretty sweet for the price.
Your are obviously not going to get quiet, super cyclone, bagless, blah blah blah and I was not expecting that.
This thing is loud, takes bags and has is not easy to store.
Good suction whether the bag is empty or 3/4 full.
The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the hose: the hose is too fragile and kinks too easily.
I wound up replacing the hose with one from another vacuum by swapping the ends.
Now it doesn't kink if you look at it wrong.And that is the ONLY negative I can find about this machine.
We own this vacuum and it has performed wonderfully for several years.
This purchase was a gift for our daughter.
I have been wanting a light-weight canister vacuum for stairs and hardwood floors.
This one has more suction than I'd imagined, and it is very light.
My only complaint is I wish it had a retractable cord.
I finally found a vacuum i like! I recently figured out that the upright vacuums I usually buy are not for me.
I had bought an oreck and got the buster buddy free...well the oreck upright bit the dust while the buster buddy trekked on.
It sucks so hard it pulls the carpet up a bit..and talk about pet hair.
With two angora long hairs i have to vacuum every day.
The head has a fabric which is like the old hand  lint removers we used to use.
I bought the Mighty Mite about a year ago and have been very pleased.
On the plus side, it has very strong suction and enough nozzle variety to get the job done.
It is light weight and easy to store.
There is no beater brush, but the brush on the nozzle and the great suction make up for it.
For what you pay, it is a very good purchase.
I have 4 dogs and this little vacuum has worked miracles for me.
Changing the bags is a breeze!  Great purchase for the money.
Bought this as a gift for elderly mother.
She was carrying her canister up and down the stairs and I wanted her to have one for each floor.
I liked the first one better, this one seems a bit on the cheap side.
The cord is stiff and the hose kinks up all the time.
we had one of these vacuums before and loved it until my wife turned it into a wet/dry vac which broke it.
we tried other replacements but in the end this vacuum was the only one that could do the job.
This is my second one, exactly same model.
I bought one for my summer house and then bought one for my other house.
The uprights pulled up the nap from my hand-knotted rugs and was causing bald spots.
The Mighty Mite has just the right amount of suction to clean the carpets but not denude them.I'm very happy with these canister machines.
I already had this vacuum for the first floor and wanted another for the second so I don't have to lug one upstairs.
At this price I was able to afford it.
This is one of the best vacuums for hardwood (or linoleum, tile) floors.
I also use it to suck cobwebs and dust off the ceiling with the brush attachment.
But, be warned, the suction is so strong that if you have wallpaper it could suck it right off the wall.
Be sure to lower the pressure which is adjustible on the side of the hose.
I can't say enough good things about this product.
It's lightweight, is easy to manuver, and cleans very well.
But, at this price, you can't have everything.
This vacuum is light weight, powerful, and maneuvers easily.
It works well on bare wood, tile or vinyl floors, upholstery, cobwebs, dusting, etc.
It does not work at all on carpet or rugs.
The hose, wands and attachments are all made of cheap plastic so be careful or they will crack.
The vent between the wand and the hose is located exactly where you hold the wand.
The first time I used the machine, my hand twisted it in such a way that it pinched my palm.
The pain was sever enough to make me consider returning the wretched thing.
My solution was to wrap the vent in duct tape.
Now it is useless but it can't bite me again.
The flimsy plastic hose and wand make it feel fragile.
The cord stores in a very unhandy place.
Should store somewhere on top for easy winding.
I hate, absolutely HATE, having debris on our hardwood floors.
So I did a lot of research and found this vacuum.
It has a very powerful suction AND it doesn't scratch our floors.
It is also lightweight and has a very long cord.
So when I vacuum, I usually gently tug the vacuum while holding the hose and the little guy follows me around like a loyal companion.
It is very versatile and includes different attachments to suit your vacuuming needs.
Changing of the bag is easy and mess-free.
I'v e had many vacuums over the years, but this is my favorite.
Does an equally good job on carpeting, wood floors and throw rugs.
Having had Eureka Mighty Mite for the last year, I am confident to say it works very well for my hardwood floors.
It sucks strong and is easy to clean out.
It is a great deal at its price point.
I have a Mighty Mite that I got 2nd hand 30 years ago.
I bought this because it had many rave reviews and it was cheap.
I just step on the power button to start and it will click on or off.
the parts are light and easy to pull around and easy to maneuver.
Wish it had a self winding function but you can only be so lazy.
I use it on a daily basis since I have laminate flooring covering most of the house and sweeping will take forever.
I use it to clean my floor, suck up hair, clean my car.
No need to go to the carwash to use the vac!  Awesome product.
Still going strong with no wear on the new hose since it's better than the hose that comes with this vacuum.Suction is still going strong.
I change the bag about 2-3 times a year.
not so much because the suction becomes weak, but rather because the vacuum gets heavy.
I LOVE THIS VACUUM, it's 100% perfect for apartments or quick spot vacuuming in homes.
I especially LOVE the old "tank" design as opposed to the current square "canister" design all vacuums companies are now using.
Look no further in it's price range THIS IS the best on the market.
If anyone has any recommendations about the switch, let me know.
I'm not handy with things like that though unfortunately.
It was a trooper! I recommend you find the should strap somewhere, also, and then it is easier to carry around.
IF you can call them vacuums, that is...My 30 yr.
One of the FEW products I ever bought that I have no complaints about.
Seems to have lots of power, and wheels!  Also bought a small shop vac that has lots of power but no wheels.
I use that in lanai, and this on my tile floors inside the house.
Would not buy for carpets, got a lightweight vac for my rugs.
I have lots of tile so this helps a lot!  Good price!  Always liked Eureka!.
We don't have any issue with winding the cord around the bottom.
In fact, the automatic rewind on my old Mighty Mite which we used for about 15 years caused us concern when young children were around.
It's got fantastic suction and works amazingly well on tile, wood floors and rugs.
Have been using it for 3 months so far and would reorder in a heartbeat.
This is a wonderful vacuum for hardwood floors (or tile, viynl ect.) will not work on carpet so don't even try.
On hard surfaces I have had no problems with the unit turning over while dragging it around as some folks have complained about.
In fact it is light enough that sometimes I just pick it up and carry it.
The only thing I really don't like is the combination tool.
The hard nozzle side is a bit redundant as well -- I find the longer and thinner crevice tool more useful.
This unit will mark if you aren't careful, but not nearly as bad as some, especially the ones with rubber bumpers.
stairs etc,just a great sweeper for a very reaaonable price,im happy happy,.
This is the second Mighty Mite I have owned.
It's a great little machine, a bit noisy, though.
I figured it was time to write a quick review after three years of regular use.
As my age progresses, it is getting more difficult to get certain household appliances from one room to another.
Not so with this little Eureka - small enough to store under a work bench in the garage, light enough to carry up the stairs.
Two areas of concern keep it from a five star rating:  it does not do a good job on dog hair on auto carpet.
It's larger cousin has to handle that job.
Additionally, the attachment hose jams up quite often.
That's easily fixed by running a long rod (like a skewer) through the hose to loosen up the debris.
Then it will usually just pick up where it left off.
Be sure not to go bonkers with the unjamming process - you don't want to poke a hole through the hose.
The main question:  does it do the job effectively?  Answer:  an absolute yes.
this is the third mighty mite vaccum i have owned, but this one gets hot when i use it, so that don't impress me.
as a mater of fact it sort of scares me.
I read all the reviews on this one before purchasing it, they were very helpful.
This is a great vac, I have tile throughout the first floor of the house and it works great on tile.
As in other reviews it is ok on carpeting, and they are right.
It is good for a quick spot pick up on carpeting but not a full vacuum.
The suction on this canister is powerful and I would recommend it.
I've owned Might Mite Canister Vacuums for the past 30 years.
This vacuum is very inexpensive so I wasn't sure what to expect.
I can't complain about the power of the product, it is fantastic.
If I could just put the motor in my 30 year old case.
The on/off button is built into the case and I don't believe it will stand the test of time.
The combo brush tool is a joke, don't bother just buy another full sized brush and upholstery tool.
I do like how they put the attachments on the case.
Just don't expect the out of the box product to last very long.
I've changed the star rating to a five because this thing performs so well.
I have changed the plastic tubing with my metal telescoping and I use a better dusting brush, but everything else I have left the same.
All of the sand disapears out of the grout and it actually sucks down to the floor and carpeting.
I used my upright on the one carpeted room with a new bag and a new belt on the brush.
Then I put a new bag in the Mighty Mite and vacuumed again.
I love it! The suction power is unbelievable! Anyone wanting a great machine at a low price I say buy it.
You will be as happy with it as I am.
I can't say enough about my Mighty Mite.
This vac is the best for compactness and easy of use.
Powerful suction and for the price you can not go wrong.
I love this small vac for my bare floors.
It is a bit loud but most vacuums are so that's not an issue for me.
It does a great job and is light weight, easy to carry up and downstairs.
All in all, a great little vacuum cleaner for the money.
After reading many reviews the overall ratings for this vacuum were quite high.
For a small sweeper it has good power and the price was reasonable.
Has a broader mouth than the one I purchased previously.
Then I bought another one for my church.
They have GREAT suction, light-weight, easy to use, and last forever.
My mom has had hers for probably 15 years and I've had mine for 6.
My son has hard wood floors in most of the house, but carpet on the stairs and hallway.
This is just the right size for him.
Bought this vacuum cleaner for those hard-to-reach places which I can't get to with the upright.
The general level of suction however is good and it picks up most dust and dirt without trouble.
It does seem to work especially well on tile.
I purchased this as a classroom vacuum, but ended up using it in the art studio.
It's light, powerful, and gets the job done.
I use on hard wood floor and it has become my back's best friend.
The only downfall is the power cord 1) it's too short and 2) you can't retract it.
Aside from that, it's exactly what I was looking for, cheap, light and efficient.
I use this vacuum on a lower floor of my house which has ceramic tile.
It's very small, easy to use, and picks up very well.
Very handy, and I'm glad to have bought it.
I can't believe  this little machine is so powerful and compact.
The price is unbelievable and  I am thrilled.
Thank You  for making my work day  FUN!  and  I therefore  give  5 STARS *****.
I had a Eureka Mighty Mite years ago.
came back to this one because it served me well before.
This little vac can suck a bowling ball through a soda straw....not really but the suctions it develops is amazing.
I have two long haired Cavalier King Chas Spaniels and porcelain tile floors on two levels and the hair accumulates daily.
I have to vacuum every other day and this thing makes it a breeze.
Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor, easy to clean filter and good accessory package.
Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors.
First, the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily.
It has no reinforcing, so you don't want to step on it or bend it around a corner.
Second, the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length.
This gives the hose a little strength, but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds.
I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it.
If it feels weak, I need to take off the hose and shake it clean.
In good clean condition, it works as well as any canister.
The suction on this little machine is unreal.
Sure, the parts are made of plastic and with careless throwing around, parts will break.
But if you are careful and don't step on the hose, you'll find this is a gem.
I have no carpets; just 2 throw rugs with non-rubber backing.
The floor feature is just what I need for my 2 floors of hardwood.
And the price?  OMG, if it quits in 2 years, I will have gotten my money's worth.
Needed a small, light duty, vacuum for our store.
After checking various reviews, purchased this item from Amazon.
It is compact, lightweight, has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag, which I prefer.
It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord.
We use it for bare floors and low-pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations.
But, the cord wrap-up holder is well designed and located.
I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed.
All, in all, this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive, convenient vacuum.
So I could get into the really hard places to reach.That my Hoover Vacume fears to tred.Like behind the Headboard of my Bed.
It is totally made from plastic.And plastic components.Like the Hose, The Machine body and the attachments.,It runs a little hot when using it.
The machine,  looks a bit like a Shop Vac.
You want to have a machine that is powerfull.
And when this ring rolls around? It cuts the suction power in half.
So this is a plus and can be used to clean the cars upholstery.So it's a good machine all around.
Just wish they were not so stingy with the vacume bags.
I mean , if your going to save Money Eureka.
By making the machine totally from plastic?  Would'nt it  Wiser?.
to add a few more bags for the Customer ?  Two,, is hardly enough.
and I own a small home.GREAT when it comes to reaching into the spaces where a floor machine just cannot get into.
This is an awesome little machine for the money.
The plastic is a little cheap and it is a little loud but you cannot beat the price or the power.
No it does not leave marks on wood floors.
No the canister does not easily tip over.
I honestly don't know where some of these silly reviews are coming from.
This is a great little vacuum for the price.
If you want perfect go spend two hundred dollars.
Excellent small vacuum for tile or hardwood floors.Doesn't clean carpet very well at all, but Eureka doesn't claim it will.
the other setting is a little loose, needs a middle height setting.
For stone and vinyl floor where spinning brush was kicking small particles all over the floor.
Good enough suction, compared to useless oreck free canister vacuum.
Parts fit well enough and stay if I push them tight.
Hose good enough also, undamaged from stepping on it.
I was sick and tired of using a broom so was in the market for a small vacuum.
It's not a big deal, but it's kind of weird.I wish that the attachments and hose had a way to break down easer for storage.
We have one area rug that's very short and close to the ground it works fine on that.
The vacuum is very light and powerful enough for bare floors.
One burnt out because the person using it was trying to save on bags and repeatedly let it get too full.
Another one lost a wheel, but it is so light it is easy to carry.
It has a surprising amount of power, but I am not sure you would want it as your only vacuum for rugs.
It is certainly not the vacuum you would buy for extensive wall-to-wall carpeting.
The previous ones I've owned have lasted for very many years.
It does everything you would want it to and more.
Light weight, easy to move around and store.
Gets into all those corners and tight spaces you want to reach.
This is the third or fourth Mighty Mite that we've had over the years.
They are extremly durable, useful and can be counted on to last for ten years, with normal use.
The first a Eureka  100 - a BIG Floor standing Model.
Did my 3 Bedroon unit with upstairs and stairs without much effort.
The extra brushes, and long handle and tubes are very good for window sills and odd corners.
Does hard floors well.The free shippind was a great help.
Thanks Amazon for assisting  in the Free Shipping.
I purchased two; one for our main house and the other for our vacation rental.
I own a Miele fior the heavy duty cleaning but this little vac is wonderful for quick pick ups.
Works great on my area rugs and jute rugs.
I also purchase extra filters and the extra battery pack.
I rinse out the filter and always have a back up filter and battery pack.
I have a baby just beginning to crawl.
I also have three pets and all hardwood floors.
I was tired of picking up my baby and brushing off all the hair from his clothes.
I decided I needed a light, quick, cordless vacuum to do a quick once over on the main level every day.
This vacuum fit the bill perfectly.It is very light.
Cordless, so I can do the whole main level in two minutes flat, never unplugging and replugging.
It easily vacuums up the course dog hair and the fluffy downy persian cat hair.
Also gets up dust and dirt, and even ice melt salt that is tracked in from our front porch.
It even works fairly well on the rug in the nursery, removing the surface dirt and hair quite well.
It will not replace your big vacuum for deep cleaning.
For my purposes, this has not been an issue.
And it is a little harder than expected to empty the canister.
Maybe it'll get easier with practice.For the price, I am ecstatic with this little guy.
I have used it every day since getting it.
I am very happy with this cordless vacuum.
I had previously purchased the Hoover Linx (approx $150) - which I loved.
However, the Linx roller stopped working within a year.
I purchased a second Linx - which also had had a problem with the roller.
So, I began looking for a much cheaper vacuum that would work, but be much cheaper to replace when needed.
Heavier items may need 3 or 4 swipes with a change of direction.
I've had the Eureka for several months and it is working well.
All things considered, this is a much better value than the Hoover Linx.
Because it is light-weight and fun to use, I usually vacuum a larger area than I intended, take it to another room, etc.
So my entire house gets done and it seems effortless.
Not so - the "two-in-one" refers to cleaning both carpets and bare floors.
I also use the floor setting (no brush action) when vacuuming  area rugs, rugs with fringe, etc.
- anything that might get tangled up in the brush.Another thing I like is the fact that the dirt container is bagless and easily accessible.
Once in a while, I lose something that is small and important or valuable.
When that happens, I am afraid to vacuum until I find it.
Now, I think I could actually use this vacuum to find things, because it would be easy to sort them out of the canister.
Works well on both hardwood and short carpeting.
Battery last a long time before needing to use bonus battery.
These are great to use for quick cleanups on my hardwoods.
Got them for gifts as well and they have been well received.
Overall, this seems to do a decent job.
I've had it less than 2 weeks, but have been using it daily.
This picks up dog hair (I have 4 Cardigan Welsh Corgis that bring in a lot of dirt and shed a lot).
I have a 1900 square foot house with wood, travertine, and ceramic tiles.
My opinion based on cleaning doormat rugs is that this product would not be a good on carpet.I use it daily on the carpet setting.
I try to vacuum quickly before the battery charge runs out.
The batteries don't always get my whole house (even with using both batteries).
I'm not sure if they are charging all the way.
It does pick up the majority of the dog hair.
It can go under my couches, but it is inconvenient because it is kind of wide.
The canister is on the small side, but it does the job.
Also, it is somewhat inconvenient to put back on.3 weeks later:  The batteries are not charging so I'm going to send it back.
but will try ordering another one in case this one was just defective.
After reading all the reviews on here, I wanted to thank everybody.
Vacuum is very powerful, and collects lots of stuff.
Hairs tend to get stuck on the brush, which I sometimes have to cut with scissors to remove.
Would have paid a bit more if there is some way of attaching a smaller hose (like for the car interior and stuff).
Overall, I'm very happy and would buy it again.
Best and easiest little vac for kitty litter and short carpet areas ever.
I now own 4 of these, one for bedroom, kitchen, garage and our garden shed.
Saves your back compared to the old dustbusters.
The brush roller works great (I always use it, even on flat surfaces).
I can't think of anything to improve it.
I have purchased a lot of these , because after so many years they get too old to work.
But I use it everyday, to pick up cat liter and cat hair, to pick up crumbs and anything else.
It is very strong for a little guy, I couldn't live without it.
It does a fine job, for what you should expect of it.
This is a great small vacuum I've had one of these since they first came out and I wouldn't want to do without it.
Best Price I can find for a cordless.
It's new so in 6 months I will update if it is as good as I hope it is.
The lame design was that the switch was too flat to turn on easily.
I built the switch up w/ hot glue, & now the vac is perfect.
The most brilliant feature is being able to trade the batteries quickly.
I make it attack dog hair, small leaves, dust bunnies, coco mat shedding, & coffee grinds.
It is super fast to shove around & easy to hide away afterwards.
I did a lot of research before purchasing this machine.
This will not replace your vacuum cleaner, but serves as a quick easy clean up machine for small messes.
I wanted something to help with stairs instead of lugging our big machine up the stairs one at a time to vacuum.
I also wanted something in the sense of a motorized &#34;dust pan&#34; for small messes--crumbs from the kids, etc.
But it is so lightweight and small and you can use it just about everywhere.
Now, it does come with a second battery which is helpfull but they do not last all that long.
As I mentioned above, it does what I wanted it to do.
It's great for stairs, small messes and cleaning up a small room.
Don't expect to replace your normal vacuum with it.
This little vacuum is the best for the daily picking up of dog hair from wooden floors.
We have three big dogs and it just has to get done every day.
The battery lasts just long enough to do the entire bottom floor of our (big) house.
This is not made for big jobs, but for a quick touch-up it's great.
I see there are some mixed reviews, but I am really loving this gadget so far.
It has been really helpful in picking up kitty litter and dust on my wood floors and low carpets.
It seems to have a good amount of power, especially when running the beater brush.
The battery is lasting quite a while, too.
It's nice that it came with an extra battery.
I think the handle is a bit flimsy, and could have a better design.
Love this little vac for cleaning our stairs and other quick pickups.
Much easier than lugging around the larger vacuum!.
I believe this is the best cordless vacuum out there for the price.
(I've tried Shark vacuums and they were awful.) The suction is great.
The battery lasts long enough for me to vacuum three rooms using the carpet setting.
I will own one of these for the rest of my life!PS: These make awesome housewarming or wedding gifts.
One messy African Grey together with a kibble-strewing canine in a kitchen where bread is baked 3-4 times a week was driving me nuts.
I was so tired of schlepping out the Dyson 2-3 times a day to vacuum the above mentioned mess.
The Eureka Quick Up Cordless is my new best friend.
It was ridiculously easy to assemble and mount the charger.
The bonus battery pack ensures there is always plenty of power to get the job done.
For those little messes that make you tired of dragging out and plugging in the big guns, the Eureka Quick Up is friggin' awesome!.
It's now gotten to the point where the machine needs to be taken apart, and professionally cleaned.
I decided to try another type of cordless vacuum, and chose the Eureka Quick Up Cordless, after doing a fair amount of research.
I will say that, for the most part, it works well.
I like the idea of having an extra battery pack.
The cleaning head has a much more open design, and has easy access for cleaning it out.
In my household, there is absolutely no getting around this last step, after I have vacuumed.
For the time being, I think this little vacuum will serve the purpose for my needs.
There is no question, however, that it will never take the place of the larger, more powerful vacuum cleaners.
But, for quick pick-ups, it does the trick.
I have a very large apartment with all bare floors.
During that week, I use the dustbuster to just go over the floors between washings.
Bending over using the dustbuster would just kill my back.
I used this machine Sunday for the first time-wow-it's as strong as the dustbuster but I don't have to bend down at all.
Today I used it again and got perfect results.
dog and it picks up all his hair with ease.
I took the handle off and vacuumed my couch.
Only reason to keep my dustbuster is to get behind the toilet and my tv stand.
I usually get about half the (small) house vacuumed in a single charge on the brush setting.
I haven't found the non-brush setting to be very useful even on hardwood floors.
I tested it out on various crumbs, dry dog food pieces, etc, and I was surprised at how little it was actually picking it.
I love the fact that you can charge the sweeper and the extra battery at the same time.
I swept our whole first floor and it didn't even sound like the battery was starting to die.
I definitely would always use it with the brush on.
I disregarded it since the other battery was more than enough to vacuum our fist floor.
When we refinished our hardwoods on our second floor I definitely needed that second battery to hold a charge to finish the whole house.
When I contacted Eureka about the problem with the second battery never charging, they were kind enough to send me a replacement battery.
I was so amazed at the great customer service provided by them I had to give them another 5 star updated review on here.
After almost two years with this vacuum is it by far the best little sweep vac I've owned.
On carpets it does a good job grabbing surface dirt except when *really* close to the baseboards.
I find it lightweight and easy to handle for quick tasks.I love that it came with two batteries so it's always ready to go.
I don't use the extended handle portions so for me this stores in a really compact space.
The beater brush setting can be on on or off.
Pleased with this purchase and recommended for light cleaning tasks on all flooring types and low to medium height carpet.
I had to rate this well, although I'd never buy another one.
I purchased this on recommendation from my local vacuum shop.
It works fairly good, short battery life with the beater brush turned on (10 min.
Max) but that's okay because it came with two batteries.
I've had it a few year now so it's been reliable.Here's what I don't like.
Don't even think about removing the dust cup indoors.
March the entire vacuum outside and take note of wind direction before you remove it.
Another issue is the amount of dust this kicks up.
I know I don't have to turn it on but then it's just in the way and blocks debris from getting past it.
For now I may splurge for the Miele s194 because of the bag and hepa filter.
After knowing I was inhaling a gazillion dust particles, the Miele might be cheaper than the co pay on a lung transplant.
Lightweight and easy to get off the wall as well as powerful for as small as it is.
I needed a vacuum but was at a loss because there are so many to choose from.
Although this is not the exact same model, I like the portability of a cordless and it's a strong vacuum.
It's easy to maneuver and there are two settings, one for carpet and one for bare floors.
The battery stayed strong for my first go around and looks to be ready to go a second time.
O.K, I took a chance even though some reviews had complaints, and bought this with the extra battery.
I AM SO GLAD I DID.It works and it works WELL.
I am 'aging' so bending over, extra steps, weight of objects all matter, now.
I do not have to bend over to unwind a cord.
I do not have to bend over at all to use this not even to empty the dirt cup and filter.
You didn't know that dirt was down there!  Great for the cat litter box, little tiny hard objects, dust, dirt,hair etc.
I am going to order one soon for the travel trailer.
It works on hard floors and on low pile carpet.
I can do my whole house on one charge.
And so easy and convenient to just pop a recharged battery out and in...Wish I had had it years ago.
I use it on the furniture too...The handle 'seems' a little loose.
It does 'seem' that way, but it's actually the way it works.
I have had it going on a year now..UPDATE January 2014,  I own 2 of these.
Have not had the first problem with either of them.
I can go over my house and still not have to change the battery if it's just a quick pickup.
It DOES pick up hair, dog and cat hair, dust bunnies, small items, and cat litter etc.
I wonder how people are having complaints and claiming it doesn't pick up.
And the fully-charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power.
Glad I don't have to lug out my big vac as often.,  This works so great on my tiled floors and area rugs.
They all after several years need their battery changed but other than that i woud highly recomend!.
I like that it has 2 battery packs - we've never had the disappointment of picking the vacuum up and realizing it's out of charge.
The only issue was the first time I emptied it, dust flew all over me when I removed the cup from the vacuum.
The brush got pretty wrapped up in hair, but it was easy to cut free.
Overall, a solid vacuum, but nothing insanely life changing.
Does a great job on my marble and low carpet areas.
I have 3 dogs and I love that I can do a quick clean up.
This is my third one! I have retired the other two over the years due to constant use.
It's a great, durable item for the price that does a really great job! Highly recommend it!.
I bought this vacuum to keep bedroom and bathroom floors tidy.
Definitely glad this one came with an extra battery so it can be switched out if you need to vacuum more.
This is easy to use, easy to clean and perfect for quick clean-up.
It works on carpet, but is not meant to be a primary vacuum cleaner.
I got this to use every day as I have a dog who sheds a lot.
This stick vac does an amazing job of picking up hair and pet dander.
My only quibble is with the original batteries that came with the vacuum: one refused to hold a charge.
The vacuum is light weight, and picks up dirt and hair quite well.
It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery.I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base.
The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws.
I'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years.
The Eureka is very reasonable priced and does a great job.
It's also pretty quiet for a vacuum and my dog who is terrified of the regular vacuum is not bothered by this at all.
For the money, this little Eureka is excellent.
It seamlessly switches from carpet to tile without effort is surprisingly powerful.
I've never had to use the extra battery because the first one holds a powerful charge.
I would recommend it to apartment and condo dwellers without hesitation.
We keep this very lightweight little vacuum right in my question, making clean up such a breeze!.
For a battery stick Vac it's not bad.
It works better with the roller bar engaged.
I use it to pick up dog hair on my tile floors.
It's a good deal for the reasonable price.
Others have posted recs on how to elongate the handle but the mfg.
should man up and make it up to par.
I bought this vacuum cleaner because I live in a very small, very crowded studio apartment.
I wanted something that was light weight and maneuverable.
I charged the batteries and today for the first time I used it.
I have low pile carpet throughout the apartment.
Other reviews state that the battery doesn't last long enough.
I had the second battery charged and ready to go but did not need it.
If more than one speck is on the floor my husband drags out the vacuum.
So I bought him this little one that hangs in the closest.
He is in little vacuum heaven buzzing around.
If you've never tried a stick vac, I highly recommend them.
Super great for quick pick-ups or a run-thru when company is coming.
I have owned several stick vacs over the years but this one tops them all.
The extra battery comes in handy and the clear top makes it easy to see when the brush needs cleaned.
Hang this near your mess area and make clean up quick and life simple.
It does a great job on hard surface flooring or carpeting.
The battery really doesn't last long but it comes with two & we always keep them charged! We use this in our camper.
I got this for my son when he moved to his own place.
It's got hardwood floors and area rugs so this is perfect for it.
Do NOT buy unless you get two batteries.
Notified them of the charging issues and they were awesome and provided the type of customer service that we rarely see anymore.
Hoping a new charging unit and batteries will improve the use time  but regardless.
customer serviced  from Eureka has me believing that if I ever have more problems, they stand behind their product.
I have birds, so before getting this stick vacuum, I was sweeping my carpet area every night around their cages.
This vacuum works beautifully, and picks up things very well.
It's not a &#34;suction&#34; type &#34;vacuum&#34;, but it does a great job mimicking one.
The other great thing is this comes with TWO batteries, so you are never without power.
With this, if your power dies out, you have another one waiting, and you continue on.
I can vacuum my living room area, the hall, etc., maybe three nights before it starts to sound low.
So it has a good longevity to the battery.
Again, I love this thing! I'm so happy I bought this!.
The extra battery pack is a bonus, tho' I haven't run down the first battery pack yet.
The battery seems to last a long time.
The mounting bracket is great for the vacuum and the extra battery.
I can do the upstairs and downstairs in a small home one one of the batteries.
Really lightweight - easy to pull out and use.
I hate traditional vacuum cleaners because of the noise, but this is really quiet and light.It is powerful enough for hardwood floors and wool rugs.
I have a shop vac, so if anything major were to happen, it's there.
You'd really be better off with a shop vac than a regular vacuum if something major were to happen anyway.
I use it on bare floors, and it works great.
It is not so loud, and I appreciate that.
I had trepidations about the power of this device, especially since it had a carpet brush.
I thought, as battery powered,at first, something has to give as a tradeoff.....either power or run-time.
Well, all worries came to ease after it's initial charge of 16-hours.
It is perfect for our use, which is, to pick up stray cat litter.
It not only achieves this, but also serves to pick up crumbs or just about any small items from a hardwood or low-pile carpeted floor.
It has run for more than fifteen minutes, with no degradation of power, on the initial battery.
if one has to sweep longer than this, of course, the battery can be changed with the charged one in less than ten-seconds.
I bought this vacuum about two years ago (the version with only one battery), and now need to replace the battery.
Since this package is about the same price as two batteries, I figured I might as well just get it and replace the vacuum altogether.
It is easy to use and works very well.
Make sure to empty the container once you see it getting full, I emptied about every 3 uses.
The other version with the clear orange container is nice because you can see how full it was without taking it off.
Come to think of it, I'll be keeping the dirt catcher from the old one too.
Having two batteries to alternate now should make them last longer, I'm hoping to get three years of use out of this package.
I ordered this primarily bc it was cordless since I have handicap issues never expecting it to pick up like a regular vacuum.
every time I use it i'm  amazed all over again.
I wholeheartedly recommend this vacuum for anyone regardless of physical abilities or disabilities!.
This is the second one of these I have purchased.
I bought the last one several years ago and it is still running strong.
I wanted a second one to keep upstairs.
This little Quick Up is exactly as advertised.
It is  light and weight has considerable suction for a cordless.
It is a little Go To machine and I think anyone would be glad they purchased it.
This would be a great gift I think anyone would be delighted to receive.change.
this is my 3rd Eureka Quick Pick Up cordless sweeper.
They are great for picking up cat and dog hair and light floor cleaning.
I use it daily as I have 2 inside cats.
The previous two did not.If you want a light weight easy to use cordless sweeper, you won't be disappointed.
I'm surprised at the power this little cordless has! It picks up the dirt, dog hair and even little pebbles.
A single battery lasts a long time, and with the spare battery ready, I can actually keep my place easily quick-swept.
It does clean so well, I'd recommend getting a spare filter or two (they're cheap) so you can rinse one out and have another ready.
I've owned other small Eurekas at my cabin and they have been dependable and long-lasting.
While it's not a deep-cleaning vac it does what I bought it to do.....bare tile and hardwood floors.
The sand and grit hauled in by me and my dogs not only grinds on my nerves, it dulls floors.
The Eureka was easy to assemble, hang and use.
The extra battery pack was the final factor that caused me to purchase this.
For bare floors and very smooth rugs/carpets it performs very well.
The beater brush, used for rugs, winds up lots of rug fabric and thread around the yellow brushes.
There isn't a way to open the beater bar and clean it.
This is especially helpful when doing a casual clean up of dog hair on the bedroom medium nap carpet.
While emptying the bad is still messy it does reveal how much hair, dust and grit you've spared your floors and carpet from.
Bought this for my parents for quick clean up for their dogs.
I like how it comes with an extra NiCad battery, even though I wish the batteries were Lithium Ion.
I don't expect this vacuum to last more than a couple years just because the batteries are NiCad.
But it cleans the floors pretty well and can clean both hardwood and carpet with two different settings.
She loves this!  It came with an extra battery, so she always has it charged.
It does a good job when needed and is light weight and convenient.
The Eureka Quick Up Cordless w/bonus Battery pack works great.
It works great on bare floor and carpets.
We bought a little sweeper just like this one about 6 years ago.
When the batteries finally died, we decided to look for a new one.
Overall, we have been very happy and I would recommend it to anyone.This sweeper is just what we were looking for.
It is pretty much a dust buster with a wider mouth and long handle so you don't have to bend over.
It has a charging base that mounts to the wall, which holds both the sweeper and the extra battery.
For someone without dogs, this would work great.
It is also nice if you have a small mess to clean up and don't want to get out the big sweeper.
This is my third one--need I say more? A great quick clean up tool--surprisingly efficient--super dog hair pick-up and light weight too!.
We retired in Florida and about half of our flooring is tile.
We needed a stick vacuum that would properly sweep the tile floor so we could then steam clean it with another device.
It's quick and easy to use and it weighs very little.
When done, we put it on the charger and it is ready for the next time we have a need for it.
It does take about 16 hours to fully charge the batteries, but it's not really  a problem, since we don't use it every day.
The extra battery should come in handy over time, since all batteries lose their ability to hold a charge.
This cordless stick vacuum is exactly what we needed and it was a good purchase.
Used it on furniture and it had adequate spray and suction.
Once I got used to the motion of cleaning it went more quickly.
The suction is quite powerful and leaves the carpet just a tad damp.
my carpet dried in about an hour.The steamvac is light and easy to carry around, even when full of water.
I don't consider the noise level a drawback.
The biggest problem in cleaning spots and stains out of furniture and area rugs is lugging around a heavy piece of equipment.
This Hoover is small enough to carry with ease and fills simply from the top.
It even has a  built in mechanism so it can't overflow.
I liked its performance overall  and found it as good, if not better then other household machines.
Of  course it seems to work best with the cleaner it came with but since it's  an economical product that isn't a problem either.
The best feature it has  is two separate tanks which means you won't end up cleaning your sofa with  dirty water.
Overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself  in one use.
With a one year old and two year old around the house, there is no end of messes, spills, leaking diapers,etc.
I highly recommend it for small jobs that don't require professional cleaning.
It'll definately get you through and do a better than expected job.
No assembly and ready to go out of box.
2 ounce of cleaner and 1/2 gallon hot water to fill the unit through a convenient fill hole.
I just got this today to clean up a mess my cat made on my couch.
There was plenty of dirty water in the recovery tank, which proves that it does suction.
Many small cleaners like this spray solution on, but don't suction it back out.I didn't think it was overly loud, considering it is a vacuum.
It is very light and easy to carry.
The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because it doesn't have a rotating brush to help scrub out stains.
Of course, I knew this when I bought it, but it would've been a nice feature.
today and had pet stains waiting to be cleaned.
After they'd been around for a few weeks this little device didn't hold back the cleaning power.
Suction is awesome and I was so impressed I started to find things I wanted to clean...couch pillows, etc.
I just couldn't stop!  I'd recommend to anyone who's considering a handy, powerful tool of this nature.
Because of the many favorable reviews I bought this little vac last week.
I also ordered the Advanced Deep Cleaner with protector and I was AMAZED with the results.
I've had a beige sofa bed that was dangerously close to be thrown away like garbage after several years of all types of kid abuse.
My sofa looks brand new, smells great and it's soft and fluffy.The machine is noisy, but it's not as bad as I expected.
The fabric on my sofa dried up quickly because the machine sucks up till the last drop of water in it.
I bought this machine on the recommendation of reviews from amazon.
We have cat vomit, juice spills and other marks made by little children and they all got cleaned out on first try.
I actually used it successfully on a mattress which had some spilled milk stains.
I purchased this timer to replace an earlier version of the same timer that stopped working.
In our condo we had these timers in two of our bathrooms and I love them.
Did it myself - female with VERY limited electrical experience but I am good with tools.It works.
We haven't' had it that long so I can't speak to longevity but it is currently doing what it's supposed to be doing.
It's installed in our main bathroom and it gets a lot of use.Directions were very easy to follow and it looks ok when installed.
I mean it looks exactly like the picture, nothing fancy or especially decorative.We bought 3 more for other fans.
We got these for our bathroom exhaust fans and they work just fine.
I'll be sure and update if there are any problems.
This is a nice little wall switch timer.
Easily installed in the wall switch box and operates quietly.
Seems well built and 60 minutes is the perfect max.
First, you cant turn the dial back to off.
Really, I needed a bit more information than "connect the wires here".
Maybe that schematic drawing would be useful to an electrician but its hieroglyphics to me.
Thank god for all the "how to" sites on the web.
The white wire and the green or bare wire (ground) from the romex don't  go to the switch at all.
They both connect directly to the proper terminal or wire on your fan /light /whatever.
In other words, all the timer unit does is regulate the current goes through that black wire.
I bought 4 of these units from Home Depot in 2005 while building a new home; I paid 15 bucks each.
I use them to automatically shut-off three bathroom fans and a laundry room fan (Broan-NuTone QTREN080 80 CFM, 0.8 Sones, Energy Star Fan).
The timer instructions and face plate say to turn the nob passed 10 minutes (at least), which I do.
They still work great after 6 years.They were easy to install.
I would purchase one of these again, if it ever failed.
BOUGHT TWO OF THEM, ONE FOR EACH BATH SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF BED TO TURN THE EXAUST FAN OFF.
After changing out a light switch in the full bath, I discovered mold in the box (its a partition wall, wasn't from another source).
The fact that I have used this timer daily for 5 years without a hitch is confirmation of its durability.
It is particularly useful in the bathrooms to control an exhaust fan.
As soon as we moved into our latest house I put one in the Master Bath.
Now I am installing them in the other two bathrooms as well.
In my previous house, the one in the Master Bath there, the only one we had, lasted 15 years.
This one is beginning to get stuck and not winding down to off position.
Each bin holds about 100 .223 or .40.
Will hold a couple of boxes of nails with no problem.
Easy to lift off and replace when necessary.
These are the same bins that came with both of my reloading presses.
I wanted a couple of extras, but for the price I just bought this six pack.
Strong, stable, stackable, 'nestable' - these boxes have it all.
Would be nice if Akro included a few labels for the front.
they do, but they want you to pay for them, so I'll just cut out some card stock.
These also can mount to the Akro wall-system which is nice, and may be the way I build my next garage work bench.
Currently they're sitting on the bench stacked 3 high.
I liked them so much I placed a second order!.
I bought these storage boxes to go with my Lee Precision Turret Press.
Great price and they look outstanding too! I would highly recommend these items to all my reloading buddies.
Yes, they are &#34;tiny&#34; for Akro bins, but that is exactly what I wanted.
I cannot downgrade this product for what bothers me--my brooms bang a bit when I open and close the door.
It does exactly what it is supposed to do without a lot of bells and whistles.
Quick and easy setup -- no installation required, even though it comes with screws.
Mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary.
A great investment for an organized utility closet! Shipment was fast and product seems of good quality, nice and sturdy.
I like that it is white so blends in with my white door.
The only thing I dislike is that the brooms and such easily slam against the door when using it.
But I don't think it's the products fault, that is just the way they hang.
I don't know how they would hang any differently though.
Why drill holes when you don't need to? It was a little difficult getting the bracket attached to the peg part.
I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
I still have this on the inside of my W/D door.
Was very excited to get this product--installed it IMMEDIATELY as our house really is short on storage/closet space.
I was able to get all my cleaning tools stored on it, including my steam mop!  Great product!.
Gave this as a gift to an elderly lady.
They work very good...but this is a great way to shop and you get exactly what you are looking for.
Vacuum cleaner bag - put it in and later take it out when it is full (or nearly so).
Works as it should and the cost - delivered to the door - is better than going out looking for it.
I've tried off-brands, including Rug Doctor, but the Hoovers seem to be more substantial and better made, so I'm sticking with them.
We purchased these bags for the first time in May 2001.
I installed a bag and thought it worked OK.
My wife who is very sensitive to house dust recognized the difference.
After a very short time my wife said she could smell the dust when the vacuum cleaner was in use.
I changed the bag in our vacuum back to a Hoover bag and the probem was cured.
This prevents these particles from escaping back into the air in the house.
This will be short, it's a replacement bag for Hoover vacuums, it's OEM, it works, no manufacturing or quality issues.
If your vacuum uses this size, I see no reason not to get it.
As long as my self propelling Hoover continues to run, and it has been running for over a decade, I will get these replacements.
I double checked, and the previous bags I used were &#34;Type Y & Z&#34; - the last one is still in the vacuum.
I replaced that one with this Type Z - fit just fine.
I figured - why bother saving fifty cents a bag or whatever, when these bags last months.
Not worth the hassle of having something not fit or work properly.
Received my vacuum cleaner bags earlier than expected, they were the best price anywhere and this is a great vendo!  Will come back many times.
They can be a little difficult to install,but that maybe a vacuum design  problem.
With cats and dogs I felt  it would be a good thing to use.
The belts are quite durable as we had the last one for 4 years.
There's not much to say other than it works as expected, as it should being an original part from Hoover.
These are an exact replacement for WindTunnel models by Hoover.
I have purchased generic in the past but the Hoover seem to last longer and are less prone to breaking.
They fit and seem to be genuine parts.
Don't be surprised if they look a lot smaller than the one you take off, they stretch.
I just purchased this double pack and I rarely use the vacuum, as there's only a single rug in the house.
The belt fit perfectly and the brush spins as it's supposed to.
You never know when a belts decides to go out and then no vacuum cleaner.
I would have given it 5 stars but it overheated on the 3rd use.
I e-mailed hoover and they said to make sure  all filters are clean.
I discover a filter above the dirt canister and it was clogged.
The new routine is to check that filter when dumping the canister.
The Hoover folks said that the motor needs lots of air flow to keep it cool.
Really impressed with how much dirt it removes from the carpet.
Last time I bought belts for my hoover they were OEM.
And if you hold the OEM alongside this orginal belt there is a SIGNIFICANT difference in quality.
Needed accessory with new vacuum, get them up front when purchasing new vacuum, installed ones working well thus far, with no issues.
Put one of these new belts on & now it vacuums like new!.
Got these for my Hoover Tempo and they fit real nice and now can vacuum again thank you will order again.
So much better to have a belt on hand when one breaks, rather than ordering and waiting.
And they are brand name, so I know they will work.
They do the job, and it is nice to have a spare on hand.
Hoover windtunnel  belt has been in use over 6 months with no problems, what can I say it works I would purchase again if needed.
The Hoover Tempo Widepath has a lot of brushing action and tends to burn through belts fairly quickly even on low pile berber carpets.
GLAD I BOUGHT EXTRA WHEN I PURCHASED THE HOVER VACUUM.
THE BELT IN THE VACUUM DIDN'T LAST BUT ABOUT 2 WEEKS.
I previously boughtHoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum, Baggedabout two years ago.
Most belts wear out over time- a few-dollar fix verses throwing away an entire vacuum should be a no brainer!.
The belts as such are excellent but the Hoover keeps killing them every few months.
My wife uses it carefully but the belt is so tightly stretched around the pegs it is bound to snap and thats what happens.
They do not make things like that any more!!!!!.
The Hoover Belts brought new life to the vacuum cleaner as you could tell the difference after they were installed.
The packaging was more than adequate and the delivery was fast.
It's really helpful to have these belts available, especially at the same time you buy the product.
I can keep them on hand and I'll be ready if the vacuum belt in use malfunctions! Thanks!.
Work as I had hoped - decent quality and price.
The belt seemed a bit tighter than what I had originally on my vacuum but that is okay since these do stretch.
The description and Hoover's part# could be better.
As another reviewer notes, 40201160 is Hoover's part# for TWO of the belts that I was trying to find using the part# in my instructions.
We started smelling a rubber burning smell and cleaned out everything we could, but it still smelled.
These are of the same quality that were original to the sweeper.
They tend to last around 5 years with our use and are much easier to find on Amazon than a retail outlet.
I bought a vacuum  at the same time and several of the reviews stated the belts broke while "breaking in" the vacuum.
So far, haven't needed the back up belt.
I feel it is proactive to get agitator belts before my new vacuum cleaner needs them.
They arrived in good shape, in a timely manner.
The belt in my vacuum broke and while I figured out the problem thought my vacuum was rendered useless.
However, as soon as I found the broken belt, I placed the ordered, got my new belts and my vacuum was as good as new.
I've used my vacuum with the replacement belt for more than a year now, so I can say they're good quality and long lasting.
Haven't had to replace the belts on our Hoover vacuum yet as we only recently purchased it.
If the need arises to change the belts I will update this review with useful information.
I ordered this 2-pack and they came quickly.
I found that my Hoover vacuum's belt broke after only 2 months after purchase.
I bought these and they seem to last longer.
They are difficult to get on, because they don't stretch very well.
You just have to be patient and ask someone to help you with it.
I clean for a living and some vacuum belts break so easily that it's a real pain in the butt.
I searched for these and in my area they were hard to find in the store.
I haven't used them yet as the old one isn't broke, just yet.
But I felt like having them in the house before it actually broke.
Product arrived on time and was well packaged.
I have not used the replacement belts yet, as my vacuum has not broken the one that came on the machine.
The product appears to be of good quality.
These belts are just like the ones I have bought at the dealer's store.
They fit the machine just as they should.
I have the Hoover Windtunnel Max vacuum cleaner and these belts fit.
Buy them in advance, because my vacuum cleaner picked up a blanket and I pulled it out when the vacuum cleaner was still on.
You are supposed to turn off the vacuum cleaner, then pull out the blanket.
I had one, because I went and bought this 2-pack along with my Hoover.
The belts are going to last us a good while.
they don't seem to go bad too often.
Glad they came packaged with the vacuum so that I have them when needed, Thinking ahead is not a bad thing.
I really wish the vacuum would have come with more than one of these belts.
These seem to break when I vacuum over something that gets wrapped around the agitator and then causes the belt to part.
This product was perfect for my Hoover vacuum though.
It replaces the original and works as expected That's all you really need to know when making a purchase - right?.
This belt made my vacuum good as new! No need to purchase a new vacuum anymore.
Sturdy,I have used it every night for at least 8 hours for the past year.
It moves a large amount of air, and is very,noisy.Its electric use in minimal,which is another bonus.
I got this for my sister when her fan stopped working for her.
It makes her room much more comfortable for her to sleep in, thank you very much.
I came very fast and she did not have to wait too long for it, only a couple of days after I ordered it.
For some strange reason, I have a lot of trouble getting to sleep if this fan isn't on.
It doesn't matter if it's snowing outside, this fan has to be on.I have been using it for 2 years and it still works great.
You have to unscrew the plastic screens, wipe the fan blade, hose down the screens, and screw them pack on.
This fan is essential for me! In the summer heat it helped keep me cool.
I've actually had this one for 7months now, and had the same exact one earlier and it was perfect.
The motors don't seem to make much noise, but there is a noticeable amount of turbulence noise from the fan blades.
These are too short.=== Summary ===These are cheap box fans, and I found them to be quite serviceable.
They could certainly be quieter, and move more air, but for $20, they work great.
If you are looking for the absolute highest volume of air, or quietest fan, you can certainly get it by spending more money.
The blades were wrong or the motor was a piece of dog poop.This fan is near perfect!  The three speeds are great.
The motor noise is NORMAL given the amount of air this thing can move.
I use mine mostly outside on the patio because I love the outdoors even on a hot day.
It really helped cool the motorhome and keep the air conditioner from freaking out.The price is right, the fan really works, really cools.
First they need 2 on each side, not just 2 on one side.
Four legs about an inch or two longer would have been a huge bonus.
I am THRILLED it keeps me cool and has some great power in that little motor.
Replace the same model which we had used continuously for 5 years.
That is saying a lot in the tropics.
This works well if you put it in your window to pull in fresh air.
the 3723 model from two years ago is fabulous.
this newer model you have to be within 2 feet to even feel any aire.
They a very useful fan! to help move air to cool my place during the hot day of summer !.
i bought this for white noise when i sleep, and it makes a consistent whirring sound which suits my noise needs just fine.
i sent it back, got another, and, and, and.
it didn't affect the fan really, so i called amazon, got a 10 dollar credit, and kept it.
they said they would be flagging the company, whatever that means.
never a problem with returns etc at amazon.
but since this is a review of the product, not the packaging, there is no star reduction.
the fan works well and it's too noisy.
I've had many "bottom end" Lasko's over the years.
rectangular steel box, 2 braces holding the motor (one end only) and a 5 bladed fan.
The box owes its rigidity to the two plastic screen grids screwed to the front and back.
All seem to have plastic "feet" to help stabilize it front-to-back so it stands better from the force of air being forced through.
They typically are all 3 speed.Lasko's are mass produced, American-made fans retailed widely at many outlets, at least in the USA.
They normally retail for $15-20 and represent excellent value at that price.
If you order by mail and have to pay shipping, much value is lost.
(this particular offering sells 3 units so the shipping is shared to bring the per-fan cost to around $25 each.
they just get so they won't "go" when powered on.
Of the many brand names I see on these box fans, I believe the Lasko is the BEST quality and longest serving.
they are designed and made in the USA.Good points*they are cheaper than virtually any other option (except a few other similar clones.
when you move this much air, it makes noise.
not sure if all blades are that brittle.
I don't think I have had a one that hasn't fallen over several times.
made to sit in a window and survive the occasional rain storm.
In that case the thermo control could be more valuable for unattended operation.
If you run it on the highest speed naturally it is a little louder.
This fan delivers the goods,goods in this case being circulating cool air.
From now on, I'll always look for a Lasko 3733 when I need to replace a fan.
I bought my first one 5 years ago and it ran 24/7 365 days a year.
It took 5 years of continuous use before one of the ball bearings wore out.
FIVE YEARS of 24/7/365 use! This is a superb fan!This fan is very well balanced.
It never wobbles or shakes.This fan is not a quiet as I'd like, but then again, I want perfection and that's not going to happen.
Simply remove the grill screws, then remove the grills.
Then unscrew the blade holder, and pull the blades off the spindle.
Replace everything, then turn it on so that it drys itself.
Good for condos or townhomes and for bad sleepers that need loud white noise to sleep...They are inexpensive to run.
About 50 cents for 24 hours of use..they are light weight.
NOT THE SAME AS THE THREE I PURCHASED YEARS AGO....HAS THE SAME MODEL NUMBER....IM AT A LOSS BUT VERY HAPPY WITH MY FANS.
This three speed box fan by Lasko is exactly the way it is advertised here.
My concern while purchasing this fan was air flow.
Needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime.
Box fans are great, place then in a window and they'll cool a room down in no time.
It is not a quiet fan like the ultra quiets on the market today but it is not as loud as those turbo jet fans.
It has a normal good size fan noise that I don't find irritating.
Other than that, you really don't need the foot attachments.
I placed on the desk, turned on high and it did not fall over.
So, to conclude it is a good solid fan for a reasonable price when your main concern is air flow.
I have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years.
It keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn.
The barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt.
I wash them down each year and they are like new.
The fans I have now are on their third barn year.
In a normal house I'm sure they would last forever.
They are a little noisy, but the horses don't care.
MOST PLEASANT WHITE NOISE: As an avid  white noise enthusiast, this is the best sounding fan I've ever come across.
I don't want the fan to be too quiet, and this one isn't.
The low is low, and the high blocks out other noises.
Our air conditioning went out on the hottest day of the year so far.
So we bought a few fans so we could survive until we could get someone to fix the problem.
This fan is good for putting in front of a window to draw in cool air.
It is effective for that purpose and does seem to keep a room cooler.
As far as this having 3 quiet speeds I'd have to say that is not quite accurate.
It is not a silent fan as it does make some noise.
But for the price it does a good job.
One thing however is that this fan scares my cats.
It might take some time for your animals to get used to the noise.~The Rebecca Review.
This fan is perfect for cooling down my room at night.
It is pretty quiet on the lowest setting and still moves a lot of air.
We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it.
This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air.
I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan.
You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store.
For years, hubby and I have bought Lasko fans to keep in our bedroom.
Just a nice, smooth hum.It does blow hard.The first one died because I let it get too dusty.
I have a teenage son at home and when he has friends who sleep over they can be a bit noisy sometimes.
This being said, if you are looking for a quiet fan then I suggest you buy another brand.
However, if you want to lower your electric bill and block out noise then this is the one to buy.
You can't go wrong with this Lesko!! I reccomend it highly!.
I've been using this fan for 3 summers now.
The grating prevents most objects from poking into fan blades (especially when you have a toddler around).
Fingers seem to be safe with the small diameter and distances of the grills from the fan blades.
Has to plastic pieces that you attach to help it stand up.
I bought an original one of these when they first came out (maybe 8-10 years??) and it is, so far, working fine.
This second one is much louder than my first, but it produces so much air and is so easy to clean, I don't mind it.
I ended up getting another one because it works so great.
It's a fan...does a fan need a review?  It works.
It moves air around just fine, though it is somewhat noisy because its a box fan.
I, like many people, have become accustomed to having a fan on when I sleep.
I have had a few other fans and most have not lasted.
I bought two of these a few years ago and both are working like new.
I use mine and my son uses his, every night on low when we sleep.
All three settings work and the fan is as quiet as a fan rapidly moving air can be.
According to my kill-a-watt, this costs me approximately 11 cents to run for 24 period on low.
You can calculate more from there if you would like.
My fans don't go into windows so they haven't seen a lot of moisture and i do clean them semi-annually.
The only problem is like all my other fans, the legs that keep them upright on high broke long ago.
I would recommend them as they run well and have pasted the test of time in my home.
It has 3 speeds, selected with a knob on top, and really does shift the air, even on setting 1.
We purchased this unit after our less expensive Rival ice cream maker died during the third use.
All metal parts, including the motor, are of heavy steel.
The dashed is metal with removable wooden slats for easy clean up.
It seems to be a bit quieter than most models and turns out a generous six quarts of ice cream.
Now instead of eating the whole batch in a day, a batch will last a couple of days.
The motor speed turns the cylinder faster than most of the models that seem to grind on and on.
We'll use it year-round, setting it in the kitchen sink while it runs to catch the overflow of ice/salt mixture.
A durable item that holds up in today's disposable times.
A bit on the loud side as in other reviews but in a restaurant kitchen, who cares as long as it does the job reliably!.
After trying some of the 'cheaper' models, I went with what my Dad had and it has worked like a charm.
It has never given me a bad batch of ice cream, and we make it all summer long.
The only thing that I've found with any homemade ice cream is to let it 'sit' for about 30 minutes after the churning is done.
I didn't fully realize how nice this peeler is until I was at my mother's over Christmas and tried to use two of hers.
It is sharp, so you don't have to use a lot of pressure, which also helps decrease hand fatigue.
All-in-all, a good product.** Update 8/18/11: I'm back to purchase two of these as stocking stuffers for my mother.
No excuses -- now she can throw out those peelers that have been hanging around since I was a kid.
Sharp peeler, owned one for more than 2 years.
It has a big and non slip handle that makes it easy to grasp.
I ave been using these peelers for about 10 years now, they last about 4 years and work better then most.
With reasonable care they last well and hold their edge, the steel seems to better grade then most.
Only drawback is since its so sharp you need to watch peeling yur knuckle by accident.
Like all OXO products, it's well made and does the job it's intended to do.
Works well, especially needed now that I'm getting some arthritis in my hands.
I like how the handle on the peeler is larger than on most peelers.
It is great for carrots, potatoes, chocolate for fondue, etc.
My wife's nascent arthritis can make it hard for her to grip small handles, but she LOVES to cook.
Its great blade and handle makes for fast peeling jobs.
Only thing would be: I wish the peels didn't hang on to the end once peeled off.
nice sharp peeler, good grip decent value for your money.
I like OXO products as a rule, it is a good quality item.
I love this peeler!  I had one just like it for many years (until I somehow lost it!) and it worked perfectly EVERY time.
I couldn't remember where I bought it and couldn't find another one in any stores - until I finally looked on Amazon.
Thank you, Amazon!  Not only is the gripper handle perfect, the blade works as it should.
I purchased a couple other peelers during my quest and I was very disappointed.
Their blades kept slipping over the vegetables without cutting.
I even tried a kitchen Aid brand and hated it.
So save yourself the frustration and the tired hands and just buy this one!.
I bought one for my mother some years ago due to her arthritis.
I bought one for myself and then for all my family members.
I don't wish to spend much of my life peeling veggies, but when I do it has to be this product.
The soft grip is very helpful in avoiding discomfort, fatigue, and pain.
I just recently purchased this item so I may not be the best reviewer of this item, but so far it works very well.
It is the best peeler I have used and it does the job really well.
If I find anything wrong, I will update my review.
Sturdy, sharp - does the job!  I hate cheap peelers this has lasted months and doesn't show signs of wear.
It was becoming increasingly more difficult for me to use my old peeler due to arthritis.
I finally had to replace my old Ecko stainless steel peeler which I had used for over 30 years and I still have.
However, I needed a more ergonomic type of handle.
I tried other peelers with comfort-grip type handles, but they were never sharp enough to do the job quickly.
I've been using this peeler for at least 3 or 4 years and it still works great.
My husband got fed up with the cheap vegetable peeler I got at a discount store so I purchased this one.
It is so easy to handle and wash and can even peel mangoes!  The blade is sharp and doesn't shift out of place.
My mom has shaky hands and this works great for her.
She uses it on oranges, and takes out the seeds with the little scoop at the tip too.
I wish I had years of experience with other peelers to write a comparative review, but I'm just a college student starting out.
Today buying another one as a gift to my mom :).
OXO has won me over on everything I've purchased and have quite a collection.
So much easier to hold; peeling edges are sharp and have bought one for both daughters to use.
Just like the last post, We had one of these for years.
Needless to say, I returned that piece of junk the next day, got a refund.
This is a great peeler it is sturdy and peels fruits and veggies.
I look forward to adding to my kitchen through more products from OXO.
Good grip, though the edge should be sharper.
Takes more effort to peel with this peeler than some others, though the grip is secure and good hand feel.
If you do not like to peel anything, this peeler is acceptable, though not superior.
It is funny the guard hides the potato as you are peeling.
I like the guard as you cannot nick yourself when peeling,and I like the little 'plastic' guard you can put back on it after cleaning.
I have several 'OXO' products,that was one of the reasons I purchased this particular peeler!.
It glides over fruits and vegetables and does all the work except aiming, for you.
I had no idea my old peeler was so dull until I started using this one.
It works very well and the large handle fits nicely in my geezer hand.
This is one of two peelers I have on hand, the other being a generic/unknown branded peeler I bought at the grocery store.
Between the two, this is by far my favorite.
But I do think it is better designed than most.
The handle has a nice contour to it that seems to be designed to fit in my hand.
The handle material also has some cushioning to it, which I appreciate.
It doesn't completely eliminate the soreness in my hand if I do a substantial amount of peeling, but I do think it reduces it.
Having compared to to my 'generic' peeler, I've noticed the other tends to make my hand feel uncomfortable and sore faster.
Overall I think this is a great peeler.
This little peeler is expensive, for what it is - a basic peeler.
So far this little peeler has handled everything I've thrown at it with ease.
Yes, I would recommend it to any cook.
I've long been a fan of OXO utensils but I didn't think there was a good are bad when it came to peelers.
I cook quite a bit and had used a peeler recently at my brother's house.
When I got this one and used it, it was like night and day.
There's something about the design of the blade that makes it pretty safe to use and still really quick at peeling.
It also comes with a nifty plastic blade cover that I use to protect the blade from dulling in my utensil drawer.
It is really smooth, easy to clean, and hold fairly well.
I do miss the eye removal tool from the standard peelers but the one it provides works well enough.
If the eye removal tool was better I would give it five stars.
It is an awesome tool to peel potatoes with.
This peeler is sturdy, sharp and still works like new even 10 years after purchasing it.
My husband doesn't mind peeling veggies since the handle is not skinny and it is easy to grip.
I threw out my other peeler and have not bought another one since this peeler has come into my kitchen.
This peeler is unlike others, as it is made in one piece.
Others are glued together and trust me, they fall apart while washing.
I didn't realize how dull my peeler was until I replaced it with the OXO Good Grips.
Peeling potatoes has never been easier!  The peeler is easy to hold and easy to use.
This tool peels easily and feels comfortable in your hand.
The gouger part at the end for digging the &#34;eyes&#34; out out potatoes is pretty much junk though.
Frustrating, but the main function of peeling is smooth and easy.
When these came I was so pleasantly surprised.
They are super sharp and so comfortable in my hand.
My 6 year old grandson is able to peel a potato all by himself without any problem as the peeler never slips in his hand.
The old one would slip and flip on him all the time.
I really like this and am so glad I got 2 of them.
It is rare when $5.99 can make you happy! This peeler will change your  life.
Carrots, cucumbers, potatoes, sweet potatoes, apples, really ripe  pears, peaches, eggplant.
We own a lot of OXO gadgets, and this one is a good example of why.
It's a workhorse in the kitchen and cleans up easy in the dishwasher.
I should have gotten one of these years ago.
Fits nicely in my hand and peels great.
I need to purchase a couple of more for my children.
Very comfortable handle, good grip and very sharp to peel potatoes, carrots and other foods that need to be peeled.
This peeler feels fantastic in your hand and we love the wide, secure handle.
It glides over the peels with ease and manages to peel very thinly so you don't waste the fruit or veggie interior.
They've even included a hole for convenient hanging on your utensil pegboard.
We have a lot of trouble with peelers (as we do with spatulas, as mentioned in my spatula review).
This one seems to work pretty well, and it's holding up well so far.
We're still hoping for a better peeler than this, but this one is pretty darn good.
Our family of seven has meals some times with five pounds of potatoes or sweet potatoes and these peelers make quick work of them.
The blades are sharp and the handles are comfortable to use.
This peeler is great, durable, and easy to use and clean.
Beats using a knife to peel carrots and other veggies.
It arrived the other day, and since then I have used it for peeling cucumbers, ginger root, apples, potatoes, and carrots.
It affords an easy grip and a smooth operation - making an otherwise dull job, zip along quite happily.
The peels are thin and sleek and make perfect treats for the chickens and guineas.
I plan to order some for other family members if they do not already have one.
I use it all the time and has grips on the side for your fingers to not slip.
I have been using cheap peelers all my life and decided to give this one a try to see what a good peeler can do.
It feels great in my hand and does a great job peeling.
By the way, I tried the OXO Good Grips Y peeler as well.
I've had mine for over two years, and it's working as well as the day I purchased it.
It doesn't dull, it peels efficiently, it's safe, light, easy to handle, easy to clean, and doesn't rust.
It works well with potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, and zucchinis.
It's crazily cheap that you should definitely give this product a try.
I can put it in the dishwasher and it is very sharp.
It does a great job on peeling potatoes.
This one is so much better than the serrated one.
I cut myself several times on the other one and have since given it away.
I love OXO products, and this was no disappointment.
Nice sturdy swivel handle, and a VERY sharp blade.
Peeling has never been more fun!  I love this peeler.
It is super easy to peel any kind of fruit I want.
I'll never go back to the regular type of peelers or God-forbid dangerous knives.
Sometimes, I buy root vegetables just so I can peel them.
I can grasp it quite easily with my miniature sized hands.
(I wear size XS gloves.)  It's not hard to clean either.
I just rinse and wipe, along the grain, using a sponge.
I've had this for months and so far no visible grime has built up on it.
It is rust free as the day I bought it.
I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
At 62 I have very arthritic hands, the more I to hold onto, the less pain I have later.
so yeah it does the job well and saves hand problems.
I DID ORDER TWO, BUT NOW I ONLY HAVE ONE.
MY DAUGHTER WAS AT MY PLACE HELPING ME IN THE KITCHEN AND WAS EQUALLY IMPRESSED AT HOW WELL THIS PEELER WORKED.
OF COURSE, I GAVE HER MY EXTRA ONE.
I MUST REMEMBER TO REORDER ANOTHER ONE FOR MYSELF.
Not much to say except it does the job and sure beats my old peelers.
I have small hands and wish the handle was narrower but I manage.
Peals potatoes so much easier than our old one, and it's nice and sharp, too.
Soft handle is comfortable to hold and easy to grip.
It's also very easy to wash.Love OXO's stuff and this one is very good.
The grip is really the biggest things about this for me.
It fits well in my hand, feels sturdy, and the blade is sharp.
It peels cleanly and makes the job a lot easier.
I have a drawer full of potato peelers.
The handle is comfortable and the swivel head makes peeling go much faster.
I've been using this Oxo Flexible potato peeler for years.
It never breaks-- it works like a charm every time!.
moved into a new apartment and these are obviously a must have for any cook.
highly recommend and they won't break your wallet!.
Slip grip is great and it peels smoothly.
Oxo makes the BEST stuff! This peeler is no exception.
The nice, fat handle is great for my arthritic hands, and the peeler stays sharp, even though it's used a lot.
It's surprising what a big difference a good design can make.
There was no catching, or damaging the produce, and it took a lot less time.
I don't think I've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO.
For years I thought that the veggie peelers I purchased time and again at the dollar stores were good enough.
This is no exception and can be placed in the dishwasher for easy cleanup.
It seems to cut a bit deep, but that might just be me.
It is sharp, comfortable to hold, and washed up easy in the dishwasher.
Somehow my old metal version of this kind of peeler disappeared.
With the available options on the market, I still wanted the old style peeler like this.
I've been very pleased with this purchase, and love (as usual) the rubber grip of the handle.
You can't even tell you just cut something.
and I simply brush it away with my hand and continue.
I have been looking for a decent peeler for a while now.
The ones at the supermarket are cheap and junky.
I wanteda decent one that works well, and this is it.
While it is a little bit more money, it peels good and is quite comfortable in my hand.
Seriously, it's the best peeler I've ever used.
The peeler part swivels easily in the grip, and it makes peeling stuff effortless.
Due to misadventures in moving we have had to buy this exact product 3 times.
The grip stays in hand with no slipping even if hand gets wet while using.
My gal friend has rheumatoid arthritis and this is the only style she can use.
The OXO is easy to use, easy to clean, very reliable product and company.
Amazon price slightly better than any other store we researched.
Once again, OXO delivers a quality kitchen product.
It's a good peeler for just about any job peeling fruits or vegetables.
I even use it to make little ribbons of vegetable and parmesan cheese.
It's comfortable in my hand and the rubbery handle is grippy, even when wet.
I have spent a lot of money on cheap peelers and saw this one on Amazon and took a chance on it.
It works great, is easy to handle and I highly recommend it.
This inexpensive gadget produces much better results, much faster and more comfortably, than any other peeler I've ever used.
It works equally well on potatos, carrots, apples, etc.
Oxo Good Grips Swivel PeelerThe potato and cucumber have met their match.
This peeler makes quick work of the skins without much fatigue to your hands.
This is the second peeler that I've bought, the first grew a couple of legs and was AWOL.
I liked the first so well that I bought another, because this is an essential tool in any kitchen.
The Good Grips line features durable, non-slip, flexible handles on every product.
Made from the same material as dishwasher gaskets, the handles are slip-proof--wet or dry--as well as dishwasher-safe.
Apples, carrots, cucumbers and potatoes all are fair game for this peeler.
The tip of the peeler has a potato eye remover which works very well.
All-in-all, your experience with this peeler will be positive as it makes quick work of the skins.
This product is manufactured in China according to the specifications of the US patent.An epicurean Bon Appetite.
This peeler is ideal - it's sharp, easy to grip, flexible, simple to clean, and seems pretty durable.
It's more expensive than it could be, but it's not overpriced and it really works well.
No complaints from me on potatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, etc.
As the man in the house who cooks, I always appreciate good tools.
This peeler works precisely like I hoped it would.
I purchased the OXO Good Grips Peeler back in 2000 and I have been using it ever since with no problems whatsoever.
I originally bought it to replace the peeler that came in my Culinary School tool kit.
That peeler had broken after only a month of use.
But I have used the OXO peeler ever since, going on 5 years now.
It feels great in my hands and peels potatoes, carrots and other vegetables perfectly.
While I was in school my classmates were constantly borrowing this from me and asking me where I bought it.
Even one of my Chef instructors loved it and would use it from time to time.
If this peeler were to ever break on me, which it has shown no signs of doing, I would not hesitate to buy another OXO.
This was a gift for my granddaughter that just moved into an apartment -- she loves it!  Works well - thanks!!.
Excellent peeler!So many peelers just don't work that well.
Lost the one I'd used for years and was so upset until I found this one.
I bought this for peeling fruits and veggies to make my own baby food.
This works great and comes with a little plastic case for the blade.
As a vegan, I work with a lot of vegetables.
As a result, this peeler is practically an extension of my arm!  I love it!  I use it regularly and the blade is still sharp.
It works perfectly on carrots, potatoes, cucumbers...you name it!.
The best thing about this peeler is the very comfortable handle.
It's easy to hold on to, plus its very sharp! It makes peeling very easy, I've used it on carrots and cucumbers with little trouble.
This peeler is very sharp, peels potatoes and carrots quickly and doesn't require too much effort.
No waste of the peels either, it just peels what needs to be peeled :).
Easy to use, makes potato peeling quick and easy.
This is my second one, good price too and easy to clean.
Keeps sharp forever, easy to clean, padded handle makes it easy on your hand, peels just the right amount of skin of whatever you're peeling.
It's sharp and sturdy, good not only for cleaning potatoes but also for peeling skin from coconut meat.
We had one of these for years and it worked perfectly until the day it mysteriously disappeared, stolen by evil space aliens.
we immediately replaced it, but for a couple of days had to use a "regular peeler" with a dull blade - horrible.
The Oxo stays sharp and just plain does the job!.
The handle is sturdy and feels good in the hand.
The "grips" help avoid slippage with your wet, kitchen hands.
Swivel action helps when peeling uneven surfaces (think potatoes).
It's definitely worth a few extra bucks to get a real peeler.
Especially if you love sweet potato mash as much as I do!.
I broke my old peeler recently and after tons of review reading I settled on this guy.
It is super sharp and gets the job done.
Also the grip is comfy so even after peeling tons for a carrot cake it wasn't as tiring.
My kids use it and love it works great on carrots, cucumber, ginger and apples.
Happy there were 3 in this pack now my kids each have their own.
I've tried others, but the Oxo is simply the best.
Peels quickly and is comfortable in the hand to use.
This swivel peeler works so well!! I even peel mango using this peeler, and it doesn't break the flesh of the fruit.
It glides on the fruit or veggie super smooth and the non slip grip handle is great.
It cost like $9 but so worth it because it works so well.
I've had this for 3 years now and it looks and feels like it's new.
The tip is hollowed out so you can scoop out bad spots on potatoes etc.
So far has held up well to several weeks of use.
We'll see how well the sharpness holds up over time.
This turned out to be darn near awesome!  My old peeler was about 10 years or more old.
Although it still worked, there was a definite issue with it being sharp enough to get the job done.
I also hand washed it every time which may be why it lasted so long but was still more of an inconvenience.
I bought this one after doing a little research and reading reviews.
Super glad I made the decision because it works perfectly!  Testing it out, I peeled 2 cucumbers in about 2 minutes or less.
Huge difference from my old one which took longer and was not as easy.
This OXO peeler is smooth as silk with the peels long and even.
I also tested the dish washer safe claim when I first received it which was accurate.
A good peeler is especially important nowadays since I tend to cook healthier meals.
A good peeler also makes for good cucumber tzatziki or sweet potato fries (baked of course).
If you need a new peeler, this is a good choice!.
I am a sharp and easy to use peeler.
I boast a sleek design and wide handle.
I glide over carrots, potatoes, and apples with ease.
We had two of these peelers and we think one of them was accidentally thrown away, so we bought another one.
My wife has arthritis and this and the other Oxo products make it much more comfortable for her to work with and handle.
I tried this in a kitchen store, bought it immediately and upon arriving home, I threw away the 4-5 other kind littering my drawer.
Try this and you will never use another brand.
It produces thin rinds and peel with little or no pulp, and cuts on the first run every single time.
This is the best peeler I have used!  I have one and have given them as gifts numerous times.
The grip is comfortable, the peeling action is smooth and quick and it just is a joy to use.
What more could you want? My wife  has carpal tunnel and loves the whole line of OXO products, but this one is  our favorite.
Even my 11 year old daughter begs me to use it when I peel  vegetables.This is the last peeler you'll ever need!.
This is our second one we have purchased.
The first one lasted for many years before it finally got dull.
Our day care kids also like it.Dishwasher safe, too.HOWEVER;The potato eye remover is nearly useless.
this peeler is of high quality material , it is very sharp , works like a charm.
She is a Cheer Leader and eats lots of salads.
This peeler helps to prep many of her fresh veggies and fruits.
Purchased as a replacement for the cheap stainless steel handled version which I seem to cut myself on regularly.
This handle is bigger, and seems to create more separation between blade and back of fingers.
I have only used this product a few times on carrots, apples, persimmons, and other fruit.
Feels very solid, and is easy to clean.
OXO brand delivers again!Durable peeler better than other I've tried.
I've never come across anything that performs as well.Peels carrots, cucmbers, etc.
I've even used it to peel pumpkins!Easy to clean!Cons:None.
Very good peeler for BIG hands!  Sharp blades.
One would be surprised how rare it is to find a peeler that is actually easy to use.
I went though a number of peelers which I all eventually abandoned in favor of my trusted knife.
Hasn't dulled over all these years of constant use.
so far have no bad reviews with this brand.
I like to buy this brand occassionally and have never had a problem.
This peeler makes light work of hard job of peeling veggies etc...I will buy no other brand for such.
I have always got oxo products because they are the best, simply put.
I bought these for my envious sister 'n law - I'm sure that she'll love them when I give them to her at Christmas.
I like this peeler better than anything I have to date.
Still there are resistant things that I think should work, but  it has not fallen apart as others have when tackling difficult veggie skins.
I bought this peeler to replace one that was getting dull.
My sister was here for a visit and also wanted one so I bought another.
I've had this for about a year, it still remains sharp enough to do a good job peeling vegetables.
Ive had a number of peelers and got tired of them getting dull or rusting.
Ive had this almost a year, and its still the best peeler Ive ever had.
To put it very simply, the blade is ultra sharp and the handle makes it ultra easy to use.
For someone with a disability or arthritis (or just weakness in your hands) this is perfect.
And even if you don't have dexterity problems the handle makes it very easy to peel a lot of potatoes and carrots.
Usually my hand is tired after two or three, but I just did more than 20 for a party and my hand was not tired.
The only reason it lost 1 star, is that I have had better.
I've used many before only to end up in the trash can.
Bought a Cuisinart peeler a week ago and it sucked.
This has the right angle and a good blade.
A much better broad handle which makes holding it a lot easier! I recommend this.
Been slicing like a pro ever since these things came in.
I've skinned cucumbers, apples, and other veggies and fruits that I couldn't skin before.
JUST AFTER ORDERING IT FROM AMAZON I SAW IT AT WALGREENS FOR 4.99....THE EVERYDAY PRICE.
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT COULD BE FOUND EVEN CHEAPER THAN 4.99 AT DISCOUNT STORES.
So far I have only used this peeler to peel potatoes because I have another peeler for carrots and other vegetables.
It works well but the razor is loose and I don't like that.
Otherwise it fine, sharp and feels ok in hand.
Had to find replacement for my mother's peeler that I'd used for 20 years.
I have been using this peeler for quite some time now.
I use it to peel potato, carrot and ginger skin.The grip is very good.
It has not slipped out of my hand once.
Small enough and good-looking enough too, and good value for the price.
Have been using for many months now, and no problem faced.
Highly recommend! A must have for the kitchen.
I think all of us have owned a peeler that is worn and beat up.
Its holding up real well and I finally don't get irritated peeling fruits :).
The blade is very sharp and peels nicely - doesn't take a thick piece of the potato or whatever I'm peeling.
I loved it so much that I ordered one for our 6 children.
I know Oxo products get always good review.
This is the reason why I bought this product.
The size of the pieces that came off when peeled with the new one was incredible.
It peels carrots equally well, and it makes cooking much more leisurely and fun.
I went with the one that doesn't turn and am quite pleased.
It quickly peels carrots and potatoes without taking much of the meat of the vegetable off.
It's easy to clean and easy to store.
I don't know, but from now on, I won't.
It is my first peeler, so I can hardly compare, but it works very well, very smooth.
I had it for 2 weeks, and peeling veggies is now a fast task in my kitchen.
the grip is soft where you hold it between thumb and index finger.
The hole on the grip is just big enough to hang this if you want.
This peeler has a good-size handle that is easy to grip even when wet.
It came with a cover over the blade - good idea.
It's sharp out of the box and I kept the cover to put back on it when it goes in the drawer.
Love the OXO Grip items I've bought over the years.
This is one sharp peeler that shipped with a clear plastic cover snapped over the blade.
I kept the cover and put it right back on the blade after washing.
I don't want the blade to get dull mingling in the drawer with all my other kitchen gadgets.
I like the way it feels in you hand.
It works great and you can't go wrong with this.
In fact, when I first used it, I was disappointed I didn't have more stuff to peel.
This peeler does not require any elbow grease to move it down the vegetable and get it to peel--you don't have to apply any pressure.
The handle is nice and big so it feels comfortable in your hand.
I purchased this years ago and have loved it from the start.
It's so comfortable to hold, works in both directions - peeling away from your hand or towards your hand.
We use it on cucumbers, potatoes, and carrots.
Takes off just the right amount of peel with each swipe.
It has held up fine in the dishwasher and seems to be still sharp enough, probably 15 years after we bought it.
Nice potato peeler, it will hold up in doing what I need it to do.
Very nice quality as most OXO products are.
It worked until I threw it away by accident.
I just wish it didn't end up in the garbage.
I got mine years ago and just bought 2 for family members.
Super easy to hold, good grip, comfy and sharp blade.
I don't use it much, but here is my 2 cents:The handle design is godlike.
However I love the previous one, it came to rusting due to its cheaply made metal I think.
So I'm seeking for a better replacement, I do like most of OXO products like can opener, wine opener etc.
This peel was great, peel thinner, exactly as I wanted.
I used an old metal vegetable peeler I bought at a garage sale twenty years ago until it broke.
My family had bought several replacements over the years and nothing did even close to as good a job until this oxo.
It's comfortable to hold, very sharp and just as fast as my old one.
Using the round eye remover takes some practice but once you get it, it works great.
It's dishwasher safe, so no more oven drying like my old one.
Slightly pricey, but you get what you pay for.
The ergonomics of the product are well thought out.
Can be used as an unwieldy but viable stabbing or slicing tool in the event of a home invasion.
This oxo good grips swivel peeler is a great addition to the kitchen.
The handle is comfortable to hold and work with and the blade is very sharp and effective.
This peeler does a great job of cutting off the skin of the vegetable without taking a lot of the actual vegetable  with it.
This is without a doubt the best peeler I've ever used.
My hands never got tired, no matter how many apples, potatoes, carrots, or anything else I peeled.
I have been using potato peelers for 40 years and I think this is the first one I have ever enjoyed using.
Talk about making fast work out of peeling potatoes and carrots.
I am purchasing one for both my daughter and son so they don't have to wait 40 years for a great peeler.
A great peeler that is easy to hold.
It is sharp and that makes it much quicker than any peeler that I have ever owned.
However, because it is sharp, without thinking I peeled a couple millimeters of skin off of one of my fingers.
I'm a lefty and have no problems using this.
I bought this because I have trigger fingers and thought the handle would help, but the handle is a bit too large.
I have never had any problem with water getting into the handle and I sometimes soak this is the sink.
It has one of the best cutting blades that can be used in a peeling toward or peeling away motion.
Nice item for the price, it has lasted me longer than any other.
comfortable, sharp and typical oxo quality and designi peel/slice everything with this thing.
veggies, fruit, cheese, soap,don't ask about the soap.
Remains sharp after countless potatoes, apples, carrots, and what have you skinned.
I can do this for days! It has a plastic cap for the blade for safe storage.
This is my favorite peeler and I now purchased a 2nd one.
It is so nice in your hands, love Oxo!.
that said, it works, does the job well.
This review left by Alan's wife, Susan, chief apple corer.
I use it to core apples before I put them in the dehydrator, It's well made and easy to clean; a very good product.
This corer works as it is supposed to for coring apples.
that is all I have used it for.
This works as good as any corer should.
You don't have to push down to hard to get the result you want.
The hole is wide enough to get everything out.
On larger apples it can leave a small amount of the core behind, but not a big deal.
This is a perfect quick and easy helper when you have two hungry toddlers that want their apples &#34;big&#34; and not sliced.
I learned about this brand through the Today's show one morning.
And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products!I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job.
It fits in my hand well and it doesn't slip at all.
You slam this thing down into an apple and PRESTO - gross seeds and tough core are gone-zo.
I like to dehydrate apples, and this has simplified that process by a million minutes.
The little teeth at the end help it break the waxy apple skin, and a quick turn pulls the core out.
The kind wth the handles that you center over the apple and push down into wedges...those just don't work well.
The trick to using this one is to twist as you push and yo get a much cleaner coring.
I used this and then slice the apples into rings...my kids love it.
We love it and use it all the time.
Core an apple in seconds.Easy to gripe handle.Made apple slices,  I am thinking apple dumplings are in my future!.
I just core the apple, then slice it up, and snack on the apple slices.
I use this to create a hole in cupcakes to fill them.
Either fill it with a mini peanut butter cup or fruit preserves and then icing on top.
If you need an apple corer, this one works very well.
It is comfortable to use and cores apples quickly and easily.
It just depends on what sorts of desserts and recipes you use.
However, if you ever need the tool to core an apple without slicing it, this is an awesome brand.
Should have gotten this a long time ago!!!  You will really love it, too!.
works well, pricey but what isnt these days.
If you dehydrate apples, it is perfect for decreasing your workload.
I like eating apples with peanut or almond butter, but I used to hate trying to cut the center out of each apple slice.
I put the apple on top of a cutting board and then push the Corer straight through the center of the apple.
It is large enough to get the entire core out of small to medium sized apples.
I have arthritic hands and this handle is super.
I bought this apple corer so I could core my apples more easily than with a knife.
It works as advertised so I'm happy! :).
This corer is of great quality, but the handle is so bulky that it doesn't store well.
I use it quite a lot, however, so I guess it's worth it.
Nothing fancy here, just a handy little tool.
It works well and gets the job done.
Most times I need to do a couple of passes at the core to get it all out.
If it had a little bigger circumference it would be really great.
I've been looking around for an apple corer (and hopefully cheaper than Pampered Chef) and stumbled upon this one.
This corer has been the perfect solution, as I can keep it in tact and remove the core for him.
Very sturdy, easy to use and a steal for the price!.
Clutz-approved! Despite lacking sharp edges, it still cuts through an apple very easily and without a lot of force.
Just try not to get too crazy with it, or you'll end up with a bunch of apple cylinders and no apple left!.
This corer is right up there with the best of the OXO tools.
The handle is large and sturdy and helps me get a good grip so I can get the core out with one motion.
I tend to buy organic when possible and those apples are generally a little smaller than conventionally grown ones.
Handle is solid and metal is firm and not easily breakable.
I use this thing to core out the inside of a potato.
Then stuff it with meat and cheese and plug the ends back with part of the core I pulled out.Try it! Yummy.
I no longer loathe using apples in recipes.
An apple corer really does save time and reduces waste.
I've used this about 15 times and it's still going strong.
Although sometimes I halfway miss the core, and have to go through again (my issue not the corer).
It's very easy to push through and core, and takes a nice clean section out of the apple.
If you're making apple dumplings, pie, etc it makes the apples look very "professional".
It really does a good job of coring with minimal effort.
I use it to core apples to put in the microwave with brown sugar and cinnimon for dessert.
I bought this based on other reviews, and I am glad I did.
I used it for the first time yesterday and had a dozen apples cored in less than 5 minutes.
It was really easy to use and did a great job!.
Before buying this product, I used an apple corer and divider.
I am starting to eat healthier and decided to buy this apple corer to see if I liked it better.
I love the OXO Good Grips Corer! It takes just seconds to core the apple and the core is easy to remove from the corer.
The handle is comfy and easy to grip.
I use this to core small and medium-sized apples and the core comes out completely.
However, I do not think the core will come completely out with larger-sized apples because of the size of the head.
does the job Apple killer no seeds left behind, bananas are safe for now easy to clean highly recommend great quality.
This little tool is awesome!  it sure saves time as in one quick motion it takes out the core including all the seeds.
Great time saver and well worth the money.
Wish I had purchased it years ago....highly recommend.
This item turned out to be even more handy than expected.
Works like a charm every time and is a snap to clean!.
Is sometimes difficult to line up all the through and apple, particularly a very large one.
So the bottom of the core may be off center and you give it a second run through.
It is very sturdy and very easy to use.
let me start by saying that I have never used this apple corer on apples.
I used it on potatoes to make a recipe called potatoe bombs (stuffed baked potatoes).
This little device worked great in coring the potatoes and I imagine it would do a great job on coring an apple too.
My recipe turned out great and this corer worked very well, helping cut down on prep time.
Needed something I could grip & use easily and this definitely does the job.
A definite YES if your hands give you trouble at the most inconvenient moment!.
I've used it on a few dozen apples, put it through the dishwasher, and its still working.
I wish it was a little sharper, it's takes some force to break the skin of the apple.
Purchased this as a gift for someone who wanted a cupcake corer.
She said it works great and makes the filling process a lot easier.
This corer works exactly as advertised, it makes coring the apples extremely easy.
The size of the whole seems perfect to get the full core out without taking out tons of extra apple.
To me this is fairly straight forward, either it works well or it doesn't, and for me this product works perfectly.
I got this because my husband will not cut up and core an apple.
I bought this tool for that reason and when I tried it it worked just like it was designed for that.
I just bought this apple corer in a local supermarket.
Now I have this and I love it.
With an easy grip handle it makes coring an apple a piece of cake.
It is very sharp, but unlike the apple corer/slicer, it doesn't cut my fingers to pieces.
When the apple is cored cutting it into many cubes or slices is a breeze.
It is a very quick job to cut an apple that has been cored.
I think I will give this corer to my friends and let them save their fingers as well.
Great product and very functional, it comes out of the dishwasher as sharp as it went in.
I would rate this corer 5 stars for functionality and usefulness.
Simple, practical, durable design and so easy to use!  I love it and bought one as a gift, too.
I wish I would have gotten one for myself sooner but am happy to have it now.
I followed the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated in buying this.
The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up.
Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use.
The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple.
Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples.
A little of the core is left in the apple, but for normal store sized apples it works great.
I found this corer to be sturdy while coring out the middles of the apples.
I can turn the corer with one hand while holding the apple with the other and still do it in one easy motion.
You push down on the stem end and punch out the core of the apple.
I used to have one of those slice-and-core type corers but this is so much better.
It's more compact in the tool drawer and it works a lot better.
We ordered two of these and they work really well when it comes to preparing apples for the pies.
Great quality and price...........which, of course, makes for a Great Deal !!!!.
I like the &#34;circular core&#34; cutter vs the &#34;star type&#34; cutters which are more common.
Not only do I use it to core apples for pie, I also use it to make filled cupcakes.
Just push down the center of the cupcake to nearly the bottom, twist and pull out.
Fill the inside and replace with just the top.
Does just what it's supposed to - cores apples perfectly every time.
The size of the corer takes away only the core and the serated edges make it really easy to shove through the apple.
The grip makes it very easy to hold and maneuver.
Dishwasher safe and a great product - would definitely recommend.
It is easy to use and simple to coring an apple.
I can even let the kids do it with no fear of them cutting themselves.
I would have liked it to be slightly larger diameter, but  for most of the apples it removes enough of the core.
The chunky ribbed handle is very comfortable and easy to grip.
It cuts quickly and easily through apples with a back and forth twisting motion as you push down over the core.
If you're a little off center and some of the core is left behind, realign the corer and make a second pass.
I used this to make old fashioned apple dumplings for my husband that his grandmother used to make for him.
This corer does exactly what it's supposed to do easily.
Nice clean cut through the center of the apple, and easy to clean it too.
Yes, you can use this to core apples.
You can also use it to hollow out baking potatoes to make "stuffed potato bombs".
And it works like a charm for that too.
See the bbq pit boys recipe on youtube.
It is very easy to use and works great.
I have had it for about a month now and it is the best corer I have had.
I would recommend this for the purpose it was designed for.
This is a nice sturdy corer; I wanted one like my grandmas but this one works as well.
As with most Oxo products, this device worked as well as expected and is well made and easy to use and clean.
I recommend this for anyone in need of a good corer for apples.
I bought this originally to core and fill cupcakes.
Then fill your cupcake (with marshmallow cream, or cherry filling, so many yummy options).
We also have used it to core cucumbers (and fill with herbed cream cheese).
One thing I like is that while the tool isn't exceptionally sharp, with a bit of pressure it easily cores items.
I like that it's not a super sharp tool, but rather serated to cut through items.
This apple corer is awesome and very high quality.
I am so glad that I bought it.
My kids really enjoy eating the apple rings that I make from it and also eating apple ring and peanut butter sandwiches.
A great product that inspires us to eat healthier.
the best there is - great buy for apple coring and very useful for making baked apples.
I was a little skeptical about this because the corers I've used in the past  usually just mangled the apple.
This one gives a nice clean cut and goes in and out relatively easy.
A great tool as are all OXO tools I've tried.
I understand they cannot make it too sharp for safety reasons, but if it were just a little sharper it would be 5 stars.
Being dull, it's safe, but requires too much pressure to push through an apple.
Ironically, applying the extra pressure actually makes it less safe because it's not as stable when one has to push so hard.
After you master the coring angle, this thingamajig really does the job.
I was using the standard &#34;segmented ring&#34; type corer but this is really nice.
Having an apple corer, I find, makes slicing apples so much simpler.
And this is the one recommended by America's Test Kitchen.
Easy to use and easy to clean up afterward.
Corer worked nicely, was easy to do, easy to get the core out of it.
I've seen different products for apples and onions that look like they do the same thing.
It cuts cleanly and doesn't take out too much either, no real waste to speak of.
Highly recommended kitchen gadget that will certainly get its uses around my house.-D.
I used it once to core a bunch of apples to make dried apple slices.
Nonetheless, makes a clean cut and removes the core in one piece.
Our daughter is starting her own cupcake company so these are perfect for getting her started.
This came quickly and is great for coring to fill the cupcakes.
I like eating apple wedges with skin on, and so does my husband.
However he doesnt like to fiddle with paring knives and I sometimes skip this healthy snack, just from laziness.
It removes a circle of twice the area of the old useless one i returned.
The actual inner diameter of the OXO corer is 3/4 inch or 19 mm.
The thickness of the actual steel is 1 mm.
The length of the steel is just around 4 inches long and the rubber handle is just about 4 inches long.
The rubber handle is oval in cross section and there is decent sized hole at the end of the handle for hanging it up.
The color is natural oxidation of the fruit juice/pulp, it's not from the corer instrument.
When you use the corer, the "cut" surface is a saw cut, so it is microscopically a bit more ragged than when using a knife.
This OXO corer is one of the few kitchen gadgets that I use often.
It makes fast work of coring an apple.
I chose this because of the 'good grip' on the product.
I have to admit, if u have a firm apple, u have to shove that corer thru with some serious force.
Other than the area turning immediately brown that has been cored, I'm happy.
I'd use this mostly to make apple pies.
So some sugar and baking will hide the browning effect it causes.
This Corer works great!!! I love it and it is so easy to use.
The OXO style handle certainly makes it easier and more comfortable to use.
It's very sharp and goes right through the apple with any issues.
It's not as wide as you think either.
I was hoping it was a tad wider but it still gets the job done most of the time.
I make apple-nut-raisin whole wheat low fat muffins for us for breakfast on the way to work.
I don't peel the apples because we're old and we need the fiber.
This little puppy makes that baking event 100% easier.
And 99% of the time, gets out all of the core and seeds.
It turned out just fine to replace what I had lost.
I would buy it again.Reliable, I would buy it again.
Corer works well for cupcakes, the main reason I bought it.
Easy to clean, easy to use...beats the heck out of a knife.
I haven't used it on fruit, and probably won't, so can't comment on traditional use.
Doesn't completely remove core all the time; but satisfied with this tool.
As far the typical apple corer, it's a good one.
It's got a nice handle and goes in smoothly.
The corer part could be a bit wider, but that's something I've run into with other corers.
This corer lives up to the excellent reputation OXO has established with it's line of kitchen products.
It feels good in the hand, and it is built to last.
Does a nice job provided you are able to push it thru an apple from stem to stern and get it centered around the core.
Otherwise it will not remove all the core in the seed area and you will have to remove that by other means.
I use this thing every time I deal with apples.
I use this tool every day and love it.
It's very well built, simple, functional, easy to use, and only takes a few seconds to clean.
If you love apples and pears, this is a must have tool.
Looks good, feels good in the hand, and works well.
Press and twist, pull back, press and clear with thumb, reach for another apple.
I needed an apple corer to dehydrate apples into apple chips.
My honey said this one was the best he's ever used.
We bought this hand grater to replace an aluminum hand grader with a looped rolled aluminum handle.
I got mine included in a utility crock.
Simple, straightforward and a boon in the kitchen.
I have another OXO grater that is quite  bit narrower and has more of a bow to it.
This one just totally lays waste to a chunk of cheddar in no time flat.
These good grips kitchen tools are well made for the money.
The rubberized handle has a very professional feel.
i pretended i was a chef in a restaurant as i grated my nutmeg! it's sturdy and sharp! a good buy i don't regret.
I like the padded handle, and it really remains straight while grating a hard hunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
The cheese does not fly all over the place either.
It washes up easily in hot soapy water.
Take a few seconds after you wash it to towel dry it.
Cheese graters are famous for rusting, and I don't think even the OXO brand is immune to that.
I like OXO quality and this is no exception.
I have the old box style one with four edges, but honestly with a food processor who needs it, not to mention it develops rust.
With this easily held grater you can position yourself over a plate, a bowl, a pan or whatever, and make precisely the grating you need.
They excel at utility, ease of use, and durability.
Any chef or gourmand should be using them.
This is a sturdy grater and the grater holes are small.
This is just the right size for me and with a little rinse and dry, it goes back in the drawer.
I buy the OXO 19pc set and it didn't come with a bottle opener.
This bottle/can opener feels just like the OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler.
Its black, rubberized grip has a section of "gills" that molds to your grip for better control.
When you're done, just pop it in the dishwasher.
The only drawback is that with long term use, the "gills" sometimes break off.
This is a handy, sturdy and attractive bottle opener you can use to either flip open pop-top caps or pierce the top of cans.
Got so tired of my old opener bending and not punching through the can and slipping on.
This is so well made and works great.
Very sturdy, and nice handle that is very easy to grip and does not slip.
I wanted to try one of these,kind of peeler,this one was a good brand priced right,I was very pleased with my choice,!.
The handle is easy to hold and fits great in both my hand as well as my husband's.
Now I cook mashed potatoes more often because it requires no effort to peel them.
Easy to handle and cuts a wide peel so that it doesn't take much time.
I picked up a OXO Y-peeler, like the above model, except with a red inlay on whim in Krogers, about.
Used to use a peeler, that wasn't a Y shape, but was just straight with a long U shaped point blade.
My hand cramped up so bad all the time! And I'm a young guy.
So I got this and have never looked back.I absolutely love this kitchen tool!Anyways, this will be a good investment when peeling potatoes or carrots.
If so, this OXO Good Grips Y-Peeler might do it for me.
It's far more comfortable to use than the all metal type the supermarket sells.Recommended.
Switching from vertical to horizontal took a little getting used to, but I love this peeler.
I had a similar one when I first married but lost it in a move or something early on.
I especially like the little scoop on the side that lets you scoop out potato eyes while you're peeling.
I wanted a peeler that would work on large items better and bother my hands less.
Great grip, easy use and a durable product.
I've had it for about a month and it is by far my favorite food prep tool in my kitchen.
Much better than anything you'd by in the dollar store.
If you want to make short work of a butternut squash, this is the peeler for you.
It holds up in the dishwasher - without getting rust spots.
2002 (I can date this by a particular apartment move and the accompanying kitchen-goods shopping spree), and it is still going strong.
This thing was a revelation! It makes it SO easy to peel potatoes, for a start.
Zero blistering, even, which I consider a bonus.
It's there for a very specific purpose, and that purpose is to dig the eyes out of your potatoes.
Looking at the unassuming little black plastic 'scoop' in question, I'd never have guessed that it would work so well, but it really does.
You can peel anything that needs peeling, of course.
My mom never had a good peeler so I finally just ordered he one.
She loves it and uses it a lot.
Loved this so much I bought a second one....that way my husband can help peel potatoes.
I really prefer this "Y" style of peeler over the standard one.
I was looking for an easier way to peel butternut squash and ran into a reference to &#34;Y&#34; peelers on another website.
That led me over here to Amazon to see what was available.
I was delighted to find OXO made one.
OXO products are good quality plus they are easy to handle because of the size and material in the handle.
With my other peeler, my fingers always seemed to be getting in the way of the strokes.
I usually always nick a nail when peeling with my old peeler.
The &#34;Y&#34; peeler lets you push away from yourself with a little more control.
The cutting edges on this OXO peeler are sharp.
I'm happy to have added this to my collection of food prep tools.
Oxo really does it the best, thisis a joy to use.
I had a crappy one before this and am very pleased at the superiority of this one.
I've always switched between a regular peeler and just peeling potatoes or apples with a knife.
Other peelers seemed to take more time than a knife.
This OXO peeler is not like the others.
It makes short work of peeling potatoes or carrots, etc.
I have two other peelers that I don't even touch since I purchased the OXO peeler.
Makes peeling easier! I prefer the straight version however, because that was what I used most of my life.
The wider blade covers more space but I find it harder to hold the item and avoid the plane of the blade with this style.
It's a great product though and when my DIL is in the kitchen helping me, she prefers this one.
Feels good in your hand (and I have small hands).
It doesn't dig into your hand while you work, and isn't heavy at all.
I can't say enough good things about this peeler, except I'm going to buy another one! :).
does exactly what it is supposed to do.
as a child i watched my grandmother use the old fashioned peeler.
she could and did peel apples do the skin came off in one long  sheet.
she just had the mastery of the tool.
when i needed a peeler, i automatically went with the same old fashioned peeler.
i'm not sure when i finally had the chance to use one of these &#34;european&#34; peelers.
they do exactly what a peeler is supposed to do, peel stuff quickly and easily.
We used to have one of these, and I'm not sure what happened.
I like this horizontal style peeler much more than the vertical style peeler.
If I could suggest one improvement to OXO it would be to make the handle a bit longer.
My wife loves it, however, you could buy it cheaper at Target.
These guys make great kitchen products! This peeler is comfortable to hold and it's nice and sharp, peeling with ease :).
If it is from OXO for the kitchen I am all for it.
Durable, long lasting, good handling and fit to hand.
Just love OXO gadgets..I think I have them all, if not will keep ordering.
It makes short work of the largest veggies and has a good feel in the hand.(No peeled fingers or knuckles).
It is the best peeler I've had - I cook/bake a lot and have tried many brands.
I have 2 of these and for few years usage they are still sharp.
I love this peeler! I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself.
I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes, turnips, carrots, etc.
Seems to be of high quality material and it's well made.
It cuts fruits and potatoes very good and vegetables like carrots just okay.
Would purchase again if I need a new one.
I'm not giving this 5 stars because it doesn't cut certain vegetables perfectly.
I've never used a better peeler! The skin just seems to fall of the vegetables.
I use it with another type I bough t at the same time.
This onereally does the best  job of peeling potatoes.
Anything OXO makes seems to be of good quality, and hold up well.
I got both this peeler and the OXO Pro Y Peeler.
It is much better than my old Zyliss peeler which I used to think is a great peeler compared to the nobrands I used before.
HOWEVER, After using the OXO Pro series - this does not compare.
I would therefore give it 4.5 if I could and not 5.
(Or I should give the Pro Peeler a 6...) Bottom line - it's a good peeler, and does the job for the price.
BUT - If you can spare the extra few bucks, the Pro is just a league of its own.
Okay, not a million, but at least 5.
I was a little skeptical to get this one, because why would this one be any different.
Well, my friend brought hers over to my house when we were preparing food for a friend's party.
First of all, the grip is so comfortable! Fits my hands perfectly and doesn't hurt my hand (as much) when peeling a thousand potatoes.
It works I have not found a jar it doesn't open, it will not break plastic.
I bought this item because I have a broken hand.
It quickly and easily grips a lid and gives the proper leverage to remove.
However, if you are disabled like me, the can/jar must be on a non slip surface to keep from using both hands.
This is a sturdy, well-made product and I gave one to my elderly aunt, who has arthritis.
the opener is just what we needed here.
Developed arthritis in my wrists and even before that it was always hard to open some jars.
Would highly recommend to anyone with or without arthritis who has problems opening jars..works on different sizes!.
I have tendonitis in my hands, and this makes opening jars a bit difficult at times.
There isn't always someone else around to open them so we picked up the OXO jar opener to give me a hand.
The teeth grip, and you twist, holding onto the Good Grips handle.The good: That handle is very comfortable for hurt hands to use.
I do believe the jar opener is a handy item, particularly for occasional use.
Just be aware that it might not stand up to heavy use.
This is a nice little lightweight, flat opener.
I got it to use on 2 liter bottle caps and it works great as I had hoped.
Also works great on most jar lids up to a large peanut butter jar lid.
This little gadget sure has made my life easier - no more pounding jars on the counter trying to loosen the tops! It works great!.
I have owned this item for a few years and think it's great.
Works well on great big jar lids as well as little bottle screw tops like those on a salad dressing bottle.
The trick is to push it firmly so it is wedged in tight when you go to twist.
Any one with dexterity problems or limited strength should have it but it's a must even if you don't have these issues.
I first tried the pointed ice cream scoop and  couldn't use it.
I have used other Oxo  tools and love them, so I tried again with this scoop.
It works so well it  seems to be designed with me in mind.
You can wash it in the dishwasher too.
I had one for many years and lost it, so I was really glad to see this design again.
I like ice cream scoops like this product.
It makes scooping ice cream and placing it on top of a cone so much easier with that release lever it has!.
I make a lot of meatballs and this is so handy to use.
Very hard to find one like this in the store.
Wow, I looked everywhere for 1) good quality 2)A full round scoop 3) A release slide and I got it all here.
You'll love it and you can't beat the price.
I loved this scoop!  Love the grip on it as it was easy to hold.
The ice cream was easy to scoop with it with no problems!  The only problem - no more ice cream! :).
I can achieve a firm grip, slices easily through hard ice cream.
A wonderful, comfortable, and well balanced rubberized handle.
As it glides over, it produces a curl that easily releases from the scoop.
I really didn't expect much from this scoop except a fatter grip, which I need due to a hand injury.
I had no great expectations - a scoop is a scoop, right? Well, not in this case.
The scoop is well balanced and light weight, and easy to grip.
It produces nice, even servings of ice cream instead of clunky chunks.
Somehow this tool makes scooping even the hardest ice cream easier, and I never need to run it under water to soften the ice cream.
Maybe it's the pointed but not sharp leading edge of the scoop that cuts right into the ice cream.
Maybe it's the leverage you get from the thick, non-slip grip.
I'm just happy it makes serving ice cream effortless.
This ice cream scoop with the pointed tip is one of the best I have ever used.
I was so happy to finally find an ice cream scoop that doesn't break or bend awkwardly after only a few uses.
This scoop is very sturdy with a big comfortable handle for those of us with big hands.
I like the shape of the scoop itself, it's a little sharper and flatter and really does a nice job digging into the ice cream.
Be careful though because this digging can lead to you puncturing the bottom or sides of the container.
These bumps don't impact the function of the scoop, but they certainly don't look that great.
It will work on really hard ice cream, but I still prefer to let the ice cream soften a bit.
Just scored one of these OXO Ice Cream Scoop on a Manager's Special at Fry's Food in Scottsdale AZ.
I love the OXO products for starting my Kitchen as newly divorced male.
I've come to expect solid, well-designed products from OXO, and this ice cream scoop did not disappoint me.
From the comfortable black rubberized grip to the heavy stainless steel scooper, it's quality quality quality.
I tried it on hard ice cream, and it does scoop it well...but don't expect to get by with no elbow grease.
I already had a Kitchenaid scoop and some generic one with a pushable lever.
This is pretty good, not as much heft as the Kitchenaid one has, but works fine, going thru most ice creams except the hardest.
Then all you need is to dip it into water.
The Kitchenaid is heavier, has a longer handle,  and the scoop has a little thicker metal.
As of this writing, I should point out that the Kitchenaid sells for $11.99 while the OXO is $7.99, making neither a cheap choice.
Don't get me wrong, I think the OXO is a good product, just not quite the quality of the Kitchenaid.
The OXO does work well, but the shorter handle is not as convenient when scooping in the bottom of the ice cream carton.
If you do decide on the OXO I doubt that you would be disappointed.
Wish I had more to compare it to, but this will give you an idea of the ones I have.
They are both good but I think the Kitchenaid has just a slight advantage.UPDATE:  I'm liking this scoop more and more.
When ice cream is really frozen hard this scoop with the pointed end outdoes them all! Four Stars Now.
Wonderful --- reminds me of when I worked for Baskin-Robbins.
Very comfortable grip, easy to make a round ball.
OXO makes nice kitchen products that are reasonably priced and are of a high quality.
This ice cream scooper is another example of this and is a nice purchase.
The primary distinction between this and your average scooper is that this one has pointed edges.
This makes it easy to get the ice cream out of the box, especially when it's hard.
It also helps with getting to ice cream out of the corners.
My only con of this scooper is that due to the shape, you won't be able to get perfect round balls of ice cream.
Of course, that is a minor issue and shouldn't be a reason to avoid buying it.
This scoop gives you a couple of great advantages that others don't provide.
First, the large, rubber like handle gives you great gripping power to dig into hard ice cream.
Oxo makes good products, and this is one of them I would highly recommend.
It's not fancy or as attractive as a Kitchenaid that I have, but it serves the purpose.
It's easy to grip the handle and scoop ice cream quite easily.
I also like the size, as it fits in my hand just perfect.
no kidding, and that number is just what's for sale on the Amazon website.The problem with chrome covered plastic...is that it's chrome covered plastic.
So with this new scoop, I'm firmly reminding myself to wash it off after using, no soaking - get it dry and put away.
Base metal is really not always that strong, and certainly metal can bend.
If that's your priority, you may want the lever/trigger type of cone, or perhaps a non-stick rounded version.
Will update this review if the scoop proves downright fragile, though!.
After submitting this product to over three years of normal use, mine is still just like new.--Reviewed by M.
Good grips utensils have always been one of my favorites because of the large comfortable handles.
I was surprised when this one arrived to see the shape of the scoop had been improved.
now the end has a rather pointed tip, and this is GREAT! it makes scooping into hard ice cream a lot easier.
This scoop puts all the others to shame.
I it is now the first one I grab when i need to scoop ice cream.
I also use it as a serving utensil if I am serving mashed potatoes or foods of similar consistency and it works great.
You will like this scoop, there is not a better one around.
My old scoop was the aluminum kind with the liquid inside that you are supposed to run under hot water before using.
Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time.
i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream.
Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!.
It's been a month and so far, so good, with this OXO ice cream scoop.
The edge digs in nicely into the tub of ice cream and the handle is easy to hold.
It really makes scooping ice cream easier and more pleasant, even if it is frozen hard.
The blade is thin so it cuts through, but is very strong.
This thing looks so deceptive.The edge will cut through even nearly frozen confections.And surprisingly nothing sticks.Now I can toss out the old ones!!.
This  Oxo Good Grips ice cream scoop  has a more spade like shape  than the older model which I have had for over four years.
The tip now comes to a rounded point rather than having a straighter edge.
The image with this item as I write seems to be of the older model.
There are no moving parts to break,its easy to clean either by hand or in the dishwasher.
The new shape is even better than the older shape.
It can usually scoop out even very firm ice cream.
I rarely need to dip the head in hot water at all.
I have arthritis and some wrist issues and this grip is very comfortable and easy to use.
I expect that this one (which will not be going outside) will hold up at least as well.
Highly recommended as a kitchen essential and would make a great little gift  for any ice cream lover you might know.
I have a large, stout tablespoon reserved for the purpose which has always served me well.
That's all changed, because now I have the OXO.Two features set this one apart from the herd.
It isn't the usual hemispherical shape that most other scoops possess.
The shape makes it easy to excavate the surface of your ice cream while in the container, even in the corners.
Creating a nice round scoop to go on top of a cone, however, is problematic.
You can do it by sort of rotating the scoop in the ice cream, but it takes a bit of practice.Clean-up is simple.
Into the dishwasher in the silverware basket and you're done.
This is an easy to grip, sturdy scoop.
The handle is cushioned, which helps you get a strong grip.
The scoop is well-built and feels sturdy in your hand.
Because of this, it makes scooping even the hardest ice cream a breeze!.
This ice cream scoop is designed just like the rest of the ones identical to this one that are on the market.
The only thing that makes this different is the weight of the metal used to construct the scoop.
The scoop is of good quality and offers a rubber handle which becomes very useful after you have made a couple scoops for parties, etc.
The price is reasonable, and as said before the quality is good.
When I'm alone and making ice cream cones for myself, I don't even use the lever that releases the scoop of ice cream.
Depends on my accuracy on any given day.
Now you know how sloppy and careless I can be but when I'm alone I don't really mind.
My family wouldn't approve of this behavior understandably, that's why we're not going to tell them how I conduct myself when making food for myself.
It's not like the flies on the wall or the ants patrolling the kitchen counters will tell me I'm doing it wrong.
It's the scoopers fault the ice cream won't release, not mine!  Don't blame the messenger as they say.
OXO Good Grips Lever Ice Cream ScoopThe other day I was searching for a different type of ice cream scoop.
This scoop had to be multi-functional, not just for ice cream, but for other tasks in the kitchen.
Something that was the right size for cookies, meatballs, making melon balls.
The size of the scoop needed to be around 2 Tablespoons.
Now, all the meatballs are uniform in size.Around the holidays when cookie baking is more in vogue.
I use this scoop for uniform sized cookie dough on the baking sheet.
This is a great tool to use as the cookies tend to be more uniform in size.
Biscuits come out more uniform as well.Now for the function that the scoop was intended, that being for ice cream serving.
I found that that it works well to get this ice cream out of the container with ease.
The thumb flip works well as the ice cream is easily place into a dish or cone.
There is a delicate balance (temperature of the items) that you have to get right for the scoop flipper mechanism to work at 100% efficiency.
There were no left over food areas around the ejection flipper or anywhere around the serving head.
It is multi-functional for different aspects of cooking found in the kitchen.
I have found many uses in my kitchen for this scoop as I'm sure will as well.An epicurean bon app&eacute;tit.
In a quest to acquire the necessary kitchen items I purchased this scoop.
I love OXO and this item doesn't disappoint.
Makes scooping out ice cream easy and clean.
Small enough and good-lloking enough to leave on the table with other silvers.
Have been using for many months now, and no problem faced.
The bristles do wear down however, over time (someone in our house uses lots of FORCE when they was pots and pans).
Plus the hole is actually big enough to hang the thing up.
I just realized that I've had this brush, using it daily, a little over 5 years.
Popped it out of the dishwasher last night and it looks like new.
What else needs saying? Oxo knocks it out of the park once again.
You know how it is when someone does the dishes, but they dont do them "right".
As an avid and professional household dish doer, I appreciate the devices that make my life easier and this is the best thing ever.
The brush is extremely comfortable for the many hours a week it spends in my hand.
I have punished it on many occasions and it still looks brand new.
It is strong, comfortable, and effective and looks good while doing it.If you are on the fence about it, I say jump and buy it.
When the price took a big dip I bought several.
The large diameter handle fits my XL hand well.
If the price is around $5 - 7 jump at $10 no way?  But if ten is nothing then go for it.
I don't like the dishwasher so I usually hand wash my plates and pots.
Amazing brush, just like the OXO bottle brush!.
I had a great little OXO brush with a suction cup that stuck to the side of the sink that finally needed replacing.
Sadly they don't seem to make that kind anymore.
It's great for glasses and even for scrubbing pans.
There is a soft plastic scraper tip for caked on stuff.I hand wash 75% of my dishes, so I use dish brushes a lot.
This is a good value dish brush and I am quite happy with it.
It's not worth paying $10 - $15 for a perfect brush when this is really good for a lot less.
These are the only dish brushes that I will use.
They work great and last a long time.
The bristles are quite firm for a brush of this type but they're spread out.
This way, the kitchen brush isn't ruined trying to clean pans and other hard-to-clean items.
The sacrifice is having to keep two brushes handly instead of the simplicity of just one, but I found it better this way.
Works well, fits my hand nicely, seems to be holding up.
I love OXO and trust all their products.
So far I have yet to be disappointed.
This is a great product to have for water bottles, travel mugs, coffee pots, etc.
It's got a sturdy handle and the bristles are a nicely firm for cleaning in spots you can't get with your hand.
I have these for my kitchen, my office (bowls, water bottles, coffee mugs) since they work so well.
I looked at the "tired" dishrag being used and quickly disposed of it.
My family finds the brush easier to use and "polishes off" the dish-washing vigils with the dishcloth.
Weekly bleachings of the dishcloths eventually wear the rags out.
The dish brush replaces the harshness of scrubbing to remove dried or sticky foods from dishes, pots, and pans without damaging them.
No more rusty or unraveling scouring pads either.
Easy to clean and comfortable in the hand.This brush is sturdy and the bristles appear to be well-rooted in the base.
Only time will tell! For now, I am satisfied.
I like to use this brush for deep scrubbing.
It doesn't cost much, and it's very good.Really, I like it, and it's a trustworthy brand in my eyes.
A STURDY, COMFORTABLE KITCHEN BRUSH FOR AROUND FIVE DOLLARS.
THE DESIGN, MATERIALS AND PRICE ARE ALL SPOT ON.
I bought this to use for my cast iron skillets.
Ive had it for a few weeks and it seems to have softened up a little already.
I will update review in a few more weeks.
Only a geek would respond on a review for a dish brush, but.
Works as advertised, as a dish brush that is.
This brush has lasted a few weeks and I tend to hand wash all my dishes.
I will continue to order more of these as I need them.
Durable, just the right size and does a great job.
I love it and you will too !  Highly Recommended~!.
I have big hands, and I hate dishwashers (the machines, not the people; in my youth I worked as a dishwasher).
I have used the brush vigorously on no-stick pots and pans and it does not scratch the surfaces at all.
I have Amazon Prime, so shipping on this item was free for me.).
This brush has a scraping surface on the head and has outlasted most that I've used.
It's my go to brush for almost everything now as it is soft enough for non-stick and tough enough for cast-iron.
We use this brush primarily to clean our cast iron skillet based on other reviews, and it does the job beautifully.
It would also be great as a dish brush.
I love that this is dishwasher safe, is OXO quality, has a good grip, and the bristles are stiff but not too stiff.
which I like but the bristles do not go far enough around the brush too make cleaning glasses, etc.
I do, however, use this brush on occasion for cleaning other items.
Got this over 2 years ago and it still looks and functions like it did the day I received it.
It can tackle any mess or grime I throw at it.
Strong bristles that do not seem to ever wear out, which is the problem I have with every other type of brush I've ever used.
The fact that I'm even taking the time to write a review about a kitchen brush should speak volumes.
Bought this to use on a cast iron pan.
Works great to cleaning the cast iron pan with just warm water.
The bristles are stiff but not so much that you think it is digging into your dishes.
All oxo products are great and I love them.
I use this for the mason jars and deep cups I have.
Don't expect to use it for the really tough stuff on your pans - for that, you use a toothbrush or something with wires.
Which is to say, sturdy, well-designed, and easy to use.
The bristles are holding up great, the angle is good, and it cleans up dishes like nobody's business.
I kind of wish I'd gone for the kind with the soap reservoir, but that's my fault, not the tool's.
I had just remodeled my kitchen and got a brand new black apron style kitchen sink.
I thought I was splurging to by an "expensive" kitchen brush, but good grief, this thing is still in pristine condition.
There has been no problem with bristle breakage, smell, mold, handle wear, etc.
I never imagined it would hold up like it has.
Save yourself the aggravation of replacing a brush constantly and go with the quality.
I mainly use this for prewashing dishes before they go in the dishwasher, but also can use it on pots and pans.
I've not needed to buy an extra one for any other purpose.
I do agree that the bristles are widely spaced, but this has not interfered with my daily use of it.
This is a good solid brush, I use it for everything.
Great for washing potatoes or washing glasses and bottles.
No problems with anything coming apart, easy to clean.Very happy with purchase.
OXO Good Grips Kitchen Brush arrived in good condition.
Larger grippy handle is great, brush cleans items well.
Only drawback is that the bristles flattened on the most used area within 4 or 5 months.
This dish brush works great for cleaning my dishes.
The bristles are soft as well as flexible.
I use this brush daily for dishes, pots, and even the sink.
The bristles are firm enough to clean tough foods yet flexible enough not to bend or get mashed if a little more pressure is used.
I go through several kitchen brushes a year and this one seems to be holding up better than previous ones.
But you ca get what you pay for.
If everyone used these, the world would be  a better place.
Gets most messes off of my cast iron pans.
Sometimes takes a little bit of effort, but it eventually gets everything off.
I've been happy with most OXO products I've purchased.
I have tossed my sponges and use Oxo good grip brushes for household cleaning jobs.
I have only had this brush a few days, but find myself using it constantly.
The brush can be put in the dishwasher, or easily cleaned by hand and soaked in a chlorox solution for a few minutes.
This brush cuts my cleaning time in the kitchen by several minutes per task.
It is definitely a good value for the price.
I have always felt that OXO is hit and miss with quality.
I have tried several of their kitchen brushes over the years and this one is pretty good.
It has a strong handle and I suspect it will last more than 6 months.
At the same time, I'll probably replace it before then for cleanliness purposes, since the head isn't replaceable.
Good for general cleaning of dishes, etc, but not for the true elbow grease stuff.
All dish brushes I have used in the past have not worked very well and got gunky.
I bought this to clean my cast iron pans.
I'd about given up on finding a dish brush that kept its shape longer than 3 sinksful of dishes.
This is the one!  I've been using it for 3 months.
It is narrow enough to go into most glassware and tough enough to scrub out grits from a saucepan.
When it finally does go, I'll buy another.Right now, the price is much better than the over $7 I paid but I'd pay it again.
Most supermarket brushes &#34;die&#34; (bristles go flat) in no time.
I've tried so many different styles in my 50 years in a kitchen.
I had come to dislike them so much I went years without ever using one.
About 6 months ago I started wanting one again so I checked out Amazon.
The OXO Good Grips Dish Brush seemed well received by Amazon members and the price was right.
I was going to try one last dish brush.
I can even scrub the bottom of a milk glass and get all the crevices.
Just the right amount of downward pressure spreads the bristles perfectly to clean the whole bottom surface.
They help remove food from dishes well and still hold up with regular use.
If I wash dishes by hand I use a scrubber sponge and castile soap.My brush looks just like it did when I first purchased it.
I wash it every few days with Dr.
Bronner's Peppermint Liquid Castile Soap, rinse well, soak in a water vinegar solution for at least an hour, rinse and hang up to dry.
I'm not a bit concerned about bacteria because it dries very quickly and it's so easy to keep clean.
The comfortable rubberized handle has a nice grip too.
I'm always going to keep a spare on hand.
This is a joy to use...so glad..as OXO never fails on things too.It does its job sp easily...try it!Service great too...thanks~~.
Bought this just to get the 25 dollar free shipping, and am back for another.
This is by far the best dish and mug brush I have ever had (mind you I am not really a kitchen-y type).
I love these Kitchen Sink Brushes, I have also purchased Several of these Brushes as well.
I might go out and purchase a few more from the Amazon's{ Amazon.com }.
There's a plastic scraper built into the front tip of this brush, which doubles the usefullness.
But this is a really good kitchen brush.
Today, I picked it up to go at a pan that had rice stuck to the bottom.
Was thinking I would need to scrape with something metal.
This thing took out most of it.The other part that's amazing is it doesn't get all gunked up or worn down.Huge success here, OXO.
I wanted a new dish brush that wouldn't fall apart after some use.
This brush is well made with the known OXO Good Grips handle.
I like to use it and then thrown it in the dish washer (top rack) to keep it nice an clean for the next use.
I have been using this brush every day and it looks and wears very well.
I have a love-hate relationship with Oxo's detergent-dispensing kitchen brushes.
I've had three of them in the past six years, and they've often been more trouble than I would like.
Detergent oozes out at inconvenient times, the brush heads break down, they're a nuisance to fill up, and the grip is not optimal.
The Oxo Good Grips bottle washer, on the other hand, has become one of life's guilty pleasures.
I needed something that could apply more pressure than the bottle washer.
As for the detergent, I prefer keeping it in the bottle anyway until I actually need  it--not in the brush.
There are fewer goopy messes in my kitchen sink that way.This brush is currently underrated by Amazon's buyers.
I expect that it will soon be discovered and will then vault to the top of the bestseller list.
Oxo Good Grips Dish Brush is one that will last for a long time.
It does a good job of general cleaning of the dishes without any effort.
Wish the head had a tough scrub brush, but I suppose the flat plastic scraper thingy works as well.
What's not to love about Oxo products? These brushes are dishwasher safe and they are very very handy.
I bought this to replace my previous five year old OXO brush.
I really didn't need a new one but I figured my new kitchen needed a new brush.
i always keep these kinds of brushes around.
they come in hand for just about anything that needs a good scrubbing.
So glad I read the other good reviews of this brush and bought it - it's a great dish brush.
It gets my plates and silverware nice & clean.
It also does an amazing job on those little storage containers lids where the manufacturer stamps words.
Before, I could never really get into those crevices.
The size of the brush and the spacing of the bristles is just great.
I bought this a few months ago and it's holding great, too.
Who ever thought I'd be a fan of a dish brush? But here I am!  :)  Highly recommended.
I purchased this brush for the sole purpose of cleaning out my cast iron pans.
The last brush I used was from the dollar store and didn't last very long.
I like that this brush has the tips that branch out at the top, making it easier to clean around the rim of the pans.
from there the brush gets all of the tough stuff out.
Then I sent the pan back on the stove for a couple of minutes under heat so the condensation evaporates.
then I spray with oil and let cool so I can store it.
Overall this is a very nice brush for the price.
I think it will last loner than the last based on it's construction.
This is wonderful for scrubbing those veggies we all love to eat.
It is easy to rinse and even goes through the dishwasher great if you need a little more wash.
Good stiff bristles scrape tough dried/burnt on food without damaging pots or dishes.
Long handle gets into coffee pots, vases, etc.
Also, I like to get all the greasy stuff out of an empty tin can before putting it in the recycling so it smell.
This kind of brush is great for that.
But it is just as effective to wash a plate or shallow bowl.
I even like it for mixing bowls because the rounded end gets into the curve where the side of the bowl transitions to the bottom.
I've had a lot of brands of this sort of brush over the years and they're getting harder and harder to find.
It's also great for washing out my nonstick T-Fal pan without damaging it -- I never put that pan in the dishwasher.
I think this dishwashing brush is the best one I've ever had.
(For a standard pan without a nonstick finish, if there's something really stubborn burnt onto it, no nylon-bristled dishwashing brush is adequate.
After a month it has held up very nice.
It is a very good shape for getting all types & sizes of dishes, pot, pans clean.
Pricey for a dish brush, but I would buy again because of its performance.
Hand washing dishes can be a pain, and I generally use a sponge to wash mine.
The problem with that is sponges tend to get kind of gross if you tackle the wrong substances with them.
We like this so much after several years use we wanted to have two of them and bought another.
It is perfect for smaller hands and very ergonomic.
We use them both pretty much every day.
It was time for a new paring knife.
This is the one for paring apples and most fruit.
It feels like an extension of my hand when paring.
The other paring knives clean wax out of candles now.
The professional series works for me.Immediate update, I meant to post this under the 3-1/2 'professional' paring knife.
It's the same price and has a much better blade.
I have owned this one and it's great for sliced a sliver of cheese out of the frig for a midnight snack.
Check out the professional one, it's only $6.99.
The 4" one is $14.99...that one I would have to think about.OXO Good Grips Professional 3-1/2-Inch Paring Knife.
I suddenly had a need for more paring knives so I decided to buy four various models on Amazon to try them out.
They are extremely sharp and the rubberized grip is very comfortable.
I wash it in a dishwasher all the time as well.
I have a fairly big variety of the good grips knives and they are all really good.
I just picked up 4 diff ones for my mom for her bday and she loved them also.
I use it to slice lemons and limes for cocktails, chopping garlic, slicing radishes, strawberries and other small fruits.
I also use it as a cheese knife as well.
As expected the knife is great; I picked up two more, the rubbery grip is great and the knife has stayed super sharp.
I like ALL the Oxo knives and utensils very much.
This paring knife, though, doesn't seem to hold an edge as well as the other Oxo knives.
I have to sharpen it before each use.
Of course, I probably use it more often than the other knives.
The &#34;fat&#34; handle really helps (I have arthritis in my fingers), but I wish the blade were smaller -- more narrow and shorter.
It is so easy to hold, particularly if you have any arthritic or other problems.
This is my second one: the last one was accidently damaged by someone who used it to pry something and bent it.
It is small and comfortable size to spread a butter.
I use it for butter and cut some fruits and vegetables.
Handle is very soft for me, because of my carpel tunnel problem.
Therefore, I figured it's time to get a real bread knife.
I bought this OXO since I have lots of their others products that I like, and the reviews were good.
I'm happy to say, that it's as great as everyone says.The knife cuts through bread loaves smoothly and cleanly.
I've washed it by hand and in the dishwasher and have never had any issues.
It feels good in the hand and balances nicely.All in all.
I cut the bread and realized I had also cut right through the towel!  Watch your fingers and the kids with this knife.
I bought this to replace one of those old, very thin serrated knives that comes with a set.
I'll bet that one is from the 1960s - it was just too thin, too flexible and had become dull.
Nothing cuts tomatoes like a sharp serrated knife.
I don't have a complete knife set and was tired of ruining loaves of bread with my dull chefs knife and other basic kitchen knives.
In all honesty the main reason I purchased this particular knife was that it was the cheapest.
Having good luck with other Oxo products previously purchased, I wasn't to hesitant to purchase yet another.
It has a sharp serrated blade and a comfortable handle that have easily handled all of my bakery cutting duties (bread and bagels mostly).
This knife is also nice for heavy skinned fruits, easing through pineapples and cantaloupes.
It has also stood up to the dishwasher rather well.
You will not be sad with this knife and will be happy with the outcome of every cut you make.
I recently bought a bread machine, and just purchased this knife.
It is exactly as described and definitely a value purchase.Would recommend.
I had bought the Aero knife and found it to be so dull and lightweight that it was downright dangerous.
It's nice to have a sharp bread knife again after so many years.
I really don't know what an excellent bread knife should do, but I imagine it should be something like this one.
This OXO knife does the trick nicely, cleanly cutting bread, tomatoes, and melons without squashing them.
Have used it to cut more than bread and did a fine job.
Not of the highest  quality but very good knife at a good price.
I tried to sharpen my serrated bread knife and ruined it.
I didn't pay attention to the delivery fee though.
I could have picked this up at Walmart or Target for a lot less.
Love this knife, makes slicing my homemade bread so much easier.
I make my wheat bread for health reasons and had a hard time slicing it with my knives.
Using this knife is like night and day, so much easier.
Inexpensive knife but has performed well for me so far.
I haven't used extensively yet and therefor it has not been through the dishwasher very many times.
I know there are more expensive knives available.
They even have pedigrees but for bread this works great pound cake too.
It's rubbery and non-slip, but I prefer smooth hard handles.
If you want a rubbery handle, this knife will work fine for you.I got a knife at WalMart one time.
Love it! It's a serrated knife, so there's not really a whole lot to say about it.
It cuts things that you'd want to cut with a serrated knife like a dream.
It's a very nice length and has a comfortable and well sized handle.
My mother tried it at our house once and said she had to have one and ordered one for herself the next day.
This knife is comfortable and does the job.
Cuts crunchy crusts and soft crusts similarly: like butter.
We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift.
A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs, and this knife does just that.
It has the nice "good Grips" handle and is a good length.
It is nice and sharp and for the price, I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull.
It is not the fanciest knife I own, but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price.
After using my previous bread knife to saw apart those cylinder wafers that connect desk pieces together (don't ask) I needed a new knife.
This one is definitely better than that one, and works great!.
My old knife was not so handy, so bought this one.
It cut smoothly leaving very little crust around.
It is a little long for what I need though.
I recommend this seller and you won't regret having a knife like this...it is wonderful.
Knife is sharp, handle is thick and rubbery, which is good because it's non-slip and is easy to grasp.
However, would be better if it came with a sheath.
Nice, thick, easy grip handle, cuts through fresh bread well, and butter-saturated toast too.
Yes, it cuts bread, it has a serrated blade, it works as it was advertised on the site, what more is there to say.
This breadknife didn't cost much and is nice and sharp with a good heft to the hand; not too lightweight.
Cuts bread, sandwiches - perfect for the price.
Great working knife, holds up to MUCH use and dishwasher - so pain free and comfortable for my arthritic fingers - LOVE OXO!!!!.
Really enjoy having this knife around; it's very sharp and has a great, comfortable handle.
I've only had it for a few weeks, so I don't know about durability, but so far so good.
Cutting bread without a bread knife is futile exercise.
This bread knife works well and is very inexpensive.
I thought I had to get a longer knife, but then I figured I can stand the bread up so that it is much narrower.
This knife cut through my crusty bread like it was butter.
Haven't had such a good bread knife in years, I'm getting another so I can cut something else without having to wash it.
We have owned a couple of bread knives.
All were serrated knives, but not all cut bread well.
The OXO (and we love that brand!) is a favorite.
It cuts soft bread, hard bread, bagels, etc.
Like with all good bread knives, you have to let the knife do the cutting and not push down.
I have had some cheaper bread knifes and I have used general knifes for bread, but this knife is really great.
This knife is sharper than some of my chefs' knives and slices bread perfectly without tearing.
This knife cuts my bread without squishing it and is dishwasher safe.
It is just what I wanted and needed!.
OXO products are universally well-made and, more importantly, well thought out.
Their design is always attractive, pleasing and well suited to actually using it.
It's a great purchase at a wonderful price.
I have used before OXO products and based on that I purchased this knife.
The best part is the rubberized handle in addition it is really sharp.
I never thought about needing a single purpose bread knife, until a bought a bread machine.
I even use it to slice tomatoes when making a sandwich.
Did not realize you really need a serrated edge to cut bread.
It's a mess otherwise trying to use a regular kitchen knife, (ok, so I'm new to cooking).
My old Sabbatier finally wore out after 20 years, and this seems an adequate (and far less expensive) replacement.
The handle is very easy to grip, as the name implies, which will make hacking through como loaves somewhat easier.
I have recently started making all my own bread and love it.
BUT - I hated cutting it!  I could never get it even and always smushed it.
I started using an electric knife and that worked better but I hate pulling it out every time I need to slice bread.
So, after some researching, I decided I needed a &#34;bread&#34; knife.
I looked at several and decided on this one due to price.
I didn't want to spend much and then it not work.
WOW!  I have used it almost every day since it arrived.
It cuts bread perfectly - straight and doesn't smush it!  I love this knife and now I don't hate cutting bread :).
It's a fantastic price for what you're getting.
Before, I had to freeze the bread and cut it frozen with a chef's knife to achieve smooth pieces.
This is a great bread knife that slices with ease.
Very effective blade that cuts bread like it was butter.
This is a very sharp knife, so much so that I cut myself on the first use.
THis is a great knife that arrives quite dull.
After correct sharpening, however, it became one of my favorites.
It is easy to hold and the balance is good.
a great buy overall, but it does dull easily.
If you hate the rusting and/or discoloration of expensive high carbon steel knives, this is the knife for you.
I find myself using it even when I could use a smaller knife.
Use a stone to keep the edge on it after every use.
Woohoo!  I cut something with this knife!  It's awesome!  It's changed my life!Ok, seriously, it's a knife.
It has a *nice* handle, doesn't get slippery when it gets wet.
(Ever try to cut a cake with an X-Acto saw?  I did.
Good!)For a first kitchen it's a great choice...and it may just be the last chef's knife you ever need to buy.
It doesn't cost $$ but that's a good thing.
(including a few by Wustoff Trident) I'm not much of a cook, but WHEN I cook, I want it to be painless and hassel free.
Great for kids in the kitchen learning to cook too.
Spend $30.00 for the 3 and make your life a whole lot easier!.
This knife solve the knife handle problem  wonderfully.
It also should give you no problem with sharpness if you have  a knife sharpener.
If you need a decent  Chef knife and are willing to sharpen it occasionally, this is a good buy.
(You have to sharpen ANY knife eventually.)I am a  quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 if you care) and I love this knife.
Not for  its mediocre blade, but for its handle.
I have 1/3 use of my hands and 1/2  use of my arms, but I have no problem using the grippy handle on this  knife.
I must say, for the very reasonable price of this knife, she's a beaut.
GREAT handle...solid and comfortable to chop on and on.
Nothing to dance in the streets about, but certainly a nice knife for a VERY nice price!.
This is the perfect instrument for making peanut butter and jelly.
It's not really sharp, so it's great for my kids.
And it's long enough that it reaches to the bottom of the jar.
I bought this for my husband, who loves peanut butter.
It is wide enough to get the product out of the jar and onto the bread, waffle or whatever.
I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder, and frankly I don't use it all that often.
They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&amp;J sandwiches with.
They use it for jelly on toast, making sandwiches, putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel, etc.
If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife, I  wouldn't bother.
But if  you've got kids, you  might want to consider it.
It can be used in every detail of making a sandwich from slicing the tomatoes to spreading toppings on the bread.
It is excellent for cutting and serving cakes and pies!!.
Nice spreader for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
It's a spreader and a knife all in one.
This is the best tool for spreading sandwich filling on bread.
Best part about this spreader is its grip! Comfortable to use and easy to clean.
use this OXO good grips spreader all the time; love that it has one side that cuts through sandwiches; handle is great.
I've never met an Oxo kitchen gadget I didn't like!  They're the best.
I have three of these spreaders, plus a whole host of other small items.
Wish I could buy every single thing Oxo makes!  Quality products.
Was just what I was looking for! The price was good.
I use these for spreading butter, mayo, peanut butter etc.
I bought a sandwich knife years ago, and loved it so much that I wanted another one.
I LOVE this spreader - I bought one to try it out, despite some negative reviews.
I thought, it's only $5, I'll try it.I haven't had any of the problems that others have stated.
I don't take it apart for cleaning, and I haven't seen any rust spots.
Very useful for peanut butter, cheese spreads, cream cheese, etc.
I like it so much, I'm ordering more.
It is the perfect replacement for the one I had that disappeared.
It has decreased my sandwich making time significantly.
I am not in the food servers business, but this sure head a kitchen knife any day of the week.
I have had this spreader for several years now.
I really like it, but you have to take REALLY good care of it, or buy a new one every year or so.
Also, the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it.
Then I let it set a few hours more, and put the item back together again.
If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then you might look elsewhere.
It's a good product, but I could do without the sirated edge.
I want it for spreading butter, peanut butter, or whatever.
The serated edge cuts into the side of plastic bottles and is irritating.
I have a few spreaders, but this one is nearly perfect.
It's longer than other, so it can reach the bottom of the peanut butter jar, and its serrated edge easily handles sandwiches.
Slip-proof and comfortable handle (an OXO feature on many products).
This is not a kitchen essential, but I love it.
I only bought it to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promotion, and as it turns out, I use it almost everyday.
I have had it for over a year, and it still looks like new.
I rarely use the dishwasher, so I wash mine by hand.
I like how the handle on the peeler is larger than on most peelers.
It is great for carrots, potatoes, chocolate for fondue, etc.
This knife is great to use on just about anything.
Whether it's slicing an apple or cutting a sandwich in half.
It was worth paying for both to give him what he really wanted.
The knife is good quality and the wide handle is nice so your hands don't get tired cutting veggies, etc.
My wife and I recommend them so highly, we even buy them for newlyweds as a housewarming gift.
They are one of the favorite pieces in our well stocked kitchen, and that's saying a lot!.
[Not recommended!!] The peeler is fine, better than the old ratty one I'd had for years, and never enjoyed using.
Now I admit I don't use it all that much, so perhaps a swivel-peeler expert would find it less satisfactory, I don't know.
For my needs, it's more than adequate.I do like the knife.
In fact, I recently replaced a set for one who lost hers during a move.
Give it a try, especially if gripping a knife for long periods is starting to bother you.
Great control and the blade is sharp as can be, making a carrot easy work.
The paring knife is sharper than my brand new Victorinox 8-inch knife.
Cuts through carrots and onions easily and with the barest effort.The handles are typically Oxo:  large, comfortable, and steady.
Until you try these, you won't realize how poorly most kitchen implements are designed.
I bought there not long after I bought my Oxo can opener, and I'm slowly buying all their tools.
Unlike most peelers, it doesn't cut into your palm or slip, and it seems to  just glide over cucumbers.
This knife blade is large enough to do most paring, chopping, and slicing tasks for an ordinary meal, and the peeler works well, too.
I've found that people with arthritis are delighted to discover this excellent OXO set.
I bought this set when I first moved into my apartment, as I've been a fan of the Good Grips products for a while now.
The knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle.
This OXO item is rock solid! Worth the money, and definitly does tenderize meat.
The spiky end pokes holes in the meat nicely and the flat end flattens out thick chicken breasts in no time flat.
It's fun to use (or at least I think so!) and it doesn't require a huge amount of strength.
The grip is comfortable and doesn't lend itself to flying out of your hands.
This is my 2nd OXO Good Grips Meat Tenderizer.
I loved my first one, but hubby put it in the dishwasher and the finish was totally corroded looking when it came out.
It got on everything it touched!  So, HAND WASH ONLY.
Solid, nice soft rubber grip and looks nice along with my other Oxo kitchen utensils.
Tenderizer part is heavy which makes it ideal.
I have not used a meat tenderizer since I lived with my parents over 36 years ago.
I needed one for a couple of new recipes and I found this one through Amazon.
It does what it is supposed to do.
It is very well made and should last a lifetime.
This is just what I was looking for.
It is great because of the non-slip handle, dimpled on one side and flat on the other.
Perfect for whatever your needs in the kitchen.
Good quality and doing a great job! High recommend it.
The grip is very easy on the hand.
I also use it to mince garlics, too.
It is built extremely well, and works great.
Smooth side is GREAT for roulade, or any  other flattening needs, The spiked side works great for cube steak, etc.
Shorter than I expected, but gives great control, and easy to use.
Handle is comfortable, as with all the good grips line.
This works great and is very sturdy and decent quality.
Its the perfect size and just over all works great!.
This is yet another sturdy, ergonomic kitchen tool that does what it says.
I will be back for more OXO Good Grips items.
I love this tenderizer!  My daughter loves steak and this is perfect for tenderizing before grilling!  Very sturdy and easy to clean afterwards!.
This was given as part of a wedding gift set.
I have not heard pro nor con about this item from the receiving couple.
NOT with this one, and it's heavy enough to pound what I need, but not too heavy that it's hard to hold onto.
Great for Chicken Parmesan or making that steak marinade penetrate all the way through.
I used this on the dead chic key and flatten it like a pancake.
Also tried it on the wife and kids and works on them too.
Ordered it on Monday, and received it on Tuesday.
Used it to tenderize chickenthighs and it worked great.
Unlike some reviews it did have a do not put in dishwashersticker on it.
Feels good in hand, love the rubber grip.
It feels great in the hand and is nicely weighted.
I am yet another fan of OXO Good Grips products.
This is a good tenderizer, but DONT put it in the dishwasher.
It is NOT dishwasher safe :( which is unfortunate.
I bought this because I split the older wood meat tenderizer I had used for years.
Better weight and balance and more even tenderizing.
I also use this to flatten meats before grilling so they cook evenly.
The dishwasher is a staple in my everyday life.
I clean everything with it...and its a bummer I cant put the tenderizer in it too.
Its a meat tenderizer...what can I say about it in at least seventeen words?  It looks nice, flattens the meat....and I'm done!.
This is a well-designed, substantial tool for the kitchen.
I gave it to one of my daughter's and now I am going to buy one for myself.
Bought this one for my son, the BBQ King, when he raved about mine!.
The weight of the material makes it much better than the wood ones.
Recently I was in the market for a new meat tenderizer.
I'm a down home country girl, and I like to prepare my meat properly prior to devouring.
This not only tenderizes the meat but terrorizes it in to submission.
Note: This works esspecially well on meat from a KOSHER deli.
The OXO Good Grips Meat Tenderizer lives up to its name, don't be fooled by naysayers.
Further note: do not make the mistake of utilizing this equipment as a sexual aid, as despite it's name it does NOT cure Erectile Dysfunction.
My husband and I had to learn this the hard way!Bon Appetit!.
This was my first tenderizer and I think it is great.
I've used it 15 times or so now and it is easy to use and clean.
The entire unit feels like it is top quality and the handle is comfortable to use.
I'm sure it will be around for years to come.
the handle is comfortable and I am able to flatten what i need quickly.
It really does make a difference when you cook your meat.
This one I got from azamon is all I would expect, massive aluminum with a good handle, just perfect.
I use this daily! Clean up is quick and easy.
I like it becase its light weight and I have trouble with mywrist and I can use this with ease yes id recommend.
good tenderizer, seems to have the right weight and bounce for the home cook, not to big easy to store.
OXO products show the thought that goes into them.
Improvement on tools to make good meals is really a technological improvement and OXO has been reinventing the basic tools with incredible success.
My wife and I both use it with no problems.
We hand wash it like many other things, so the dishwasher is irrelevant.
should last for years, at least we hope so.
OXO products are always great quality - - - a good addition to any kitchen.
I got this for my daughter, who loves the weight and the balance.
Easy to hold and use, could be a little heavier, but works fine.
Used it on some chicken breasts and they came out well.
This meat hammer arrived quickly and is of great quality.
The handle is rubberized for an easy grip and the hammer has two heads for different applications.
The handle is firm but soft and so easy to use.
The metal it is made from works perfectly and does a great job.
I bought one for myself and our 6 children.
This  works great and is  an excellent purchase for the price.
I used this for several years, and it is fine for what it is.
I've had just a few weeks but have used already a couple of times and it works great.
This is great!  Pounds even the toughest steaks down and breaks the fibers of the meat, so that is becomes a lot more chewable.
So I just wash it out by hand and use it for next time!.
As I have said in other reviews, I love the uality, heft and grip of OXO products.
The grip is exactly what my arthritic hand needed.
Using this masher made things a lot easier than trying to mash with a utensil that is not made for this specific purpose.
Not essential, but makes life a lot easier and cooking a lot more enjoyable!.
It does leave them fairly lumpy unless you're a mashing master.
Simple sturdy product that does what its supposed to.
I decided to finally retire my old homemade hand-welded masher made by an old family member.
It was too short for average amounts of mashed root veggies.
I had decided to match my new melon baller also from OXO.
My OXO purchases have all been great replacements for all my antiquated kitchen tools.
Nothing like working more ergonomically and efficiently as we get older.
Great sturdy design!! The handle is well made, soft on the hands, good non-slip grip but yet durable.
The heavy duty stainless steel designed wire mesh does every job perfect.Charms.
This is a perfect size for mashing potatoes in my deep ancient bowl.
The handle is long enough to keep my hands out of the mash, and short enough to concentrate the force.
The wiggles easily cut through the potatoes, but are close enough to each other that I can move them around as with a spoon.
That's why I bought this masher from OXO.This one is a solid, heavy-gauge steel wire that goes all the way up into the sturdy handle.
I am so happy to have this larger, wider handle grip on this potato masher.
Our old masher had a thin handle and was tiring to use.
The wider grip makes mashing potatoes easy to do without any strain.
Sturdy metal potato smasher, which gets used by us for everything but mashing potatoes.
Also, we have tried it with plastic potato mashers and it does not work as well.
I use this product  to mash my black beans, onions, & green chilis.
It takes a little strength to use & a little time, but I have no complaints.
It is a well made piece & is easy to clean when I hand wash it.
I use this occasionally, & it has been durable so far.
Has a good feel with the handle which feels good in my hand.
I have used this masher maybe 20 times and it has held up just fine and shown no wear.
It has a comfortable grip that is easy to hold.
The design works well for easily mashing potatoes.
The entire item is easy to clean and is a good value as the price is relatively low.
I also like the design .It is made gadgets were made years ago.
I am in love with this brand!  OXO Good Grips is just great kitchen products.
This masher is the reason my arthritic self can make mashed potatoes without pain, LOL!.
I had a flimsy potato masher with a terrible handle I could hardly wait to get rid of.
This one is easy and comfortable to use,very sturdy and  does exactly what is supposed to do.
I had been using a hand-held beater to mash potatoes.
Mashes quickly and don't have to go through all the hassle assembling and then taking apart the hand-held beater.
For my husbands and I's first Christmas I asked for a potato masher.
He got this exact one and I can say that I've used it once a week for 10 years and its still perfect.
The handle is just fine and it never rusted or anything.
I love all the Oxo products, they really do last years and years.
Old fashioned masher is just what I wanted and this works great.
Substantial too, not flimsy.Great for anyone and anything; potatoes, gravy, even dough.
I have always used my electric mixer for mashed potatoes.
I saw this in the store and thought I would try it out.
easy to use and best of all I don't have to mess with my mixer.
Better quality than the similar style one that this replaced; since it's OXO, expect it to last for awhile.
I love this product because it's not big, and it is sturdy.
It does its job in mashing pretty much anything you want.
It mashes potatoes as well we anything else that can be masked like turnips, carrots, egg plant, etc.
I needed something to mash fruits and vegtables with out bringing out the big guns.
I had purchaced one of those plastic round mashers with a grid.
The holes were too small, they were always plugging up.This works great, has substance and gets the job done easily.
Sometimes the simplest kitchen tools make things easier than electronic ones.
I'm sure this potato masher will last forever.
This is a great, old-fashioned style of potato masher, which produces the type of mashed potatoes I remember from my childhood.
What it has, though, that ones from many years ago did not is the OXO ergonometric design, with a comfortable handle.
I love OXO Good Grips, and own a ton of their products.
This one is solid, durable, and awesome, except it is more difficult than my previous masher to get the edges of my pot.
My previous masher has a circular head, which works well for curved pots, but this one is straight and just takes a bit more effort.
It really isn't a problem for me, and I still use it, but it's certainly a flaw.
I purchased this masher today and wasnt surprised at the quality.
I have long known that oxo good grips makes the best product.
The masher is another example of the company's wonderful quality.
The handle is rubber and is easy on the hands yet durable.
The potatoes don't get stuck in it when you mash them like they did in my criss cross one.
I purchased Several OXO Good Grips including a Lemon/Lime Reamer, Cheese Plane, Wire Potato Masher and Box Grader.
They were all reasonably priced and are made of good quality material.
The potato masher is the best that I have ever used and I use it for everything.
I like to mix bell pepper and onions in ground beef instead of using a large spoon.
Add a can of black olives in the mix and mash them up also.
The handle has a nice grip and is nice and soft.
I considered this brand because I have the wire whisks and other products by OXO.
This replaced my old masher of 20+ years, love the OXO grip.
You can't go wrong with an old standard, it worked great for breaking up potatoes.
It works just like it should, good rubber handle.
Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years.
I have used mine for a long time and this one was for my grandaughter.
What can you say it is built solid and does its job.
my fruit into jam and works great highly recommend.
This "potato masher" is perfect if you like "smashed" potatoes rather than mashed, and you like to leave the skin on your potatoes.
I had the kind with the flat head and holes and it works fine for peeled potatoes.
If I left the peels on, they got stuck in the holes and I kept having to clean them out.
You also end up with smooth potatoes rather than lumpy like I prefer.
So I purchased this "masher" and couldn't be happier.
It makes perfect "smashed" potatoes and any other root vegetables.
It works so much better (and faster) than a wooden spoon.
Just be careful if you are using a non-stick pan not to scrape the bottom of the pan.
Another good use for this masher is to break up whole tomatoes from a can.
I made the pefect lumpy potatoes with this.
I have a ricer, but I wanted the mashed potatoes from my childhood.
I went out and bought this specifically for the task.
The handle felt fine, better than what my mother used to have.
I remember hers having more mashing surface, but that may be because I was young.
The &#34;wire&#34; portion is solid, sturdy and will never bend.
The handle is long, has an adequate circumference and is padded, making it easy to grip and at the same time, comfortable.
To top it all off, the end of the handle has extra padding on it so when you bear down it doesn't feel uncomfortable.
It is very much like the one my mother used when I was a kid.
It is also much cheaper to use than a hand mixer.
My wife loved it and uses it to make the best mashed potatoes ever!  Yeah, it is a tool that is comfortable and works nicely.
I've not found an OXO product I dislike yet.
This one replaces my decades old masher, which had a too-small handle that hurt my hand when used.
This baby comes in handy with mashing vegetables and other ingredients, as well.
It's become one of my favorite kitchen tools.
I am partial to a lot of the OXO kitchen implements.
I have used this offer several times, and it makes it well worthwhile to order four items and get the least expensive free.
This design has been around for a while and it does its job.
We tried the newer designs for a potato masher and returned to this classic.
It's cheap and you can make it all different ways.
This bad boy makes things a lot easier.
This product is like a form of black magic.
My wife started with a bowl full of boiled potatoes, some milk and this wizards instrument.
Before long, the sorcery of this product yielded mashed potatoes.
Unlike anything I have ever seen.That was more fun to write than &#34;Comfortable handle, mashes potatoes well&#34;.
OXO does have a pretty good record of making good, solid and useful kitchen utensils.
It's a bit shorter than some mashers, but seems extra solid with a good, easy-to-grip handle.
potatoes, winter squash and sweet potatoes have no chance.
But really, if you want perfectly lump-free mashed potatoes, you should be using a ricer, not a masher.
My ancient wire potato masher finally gave up the ghost, after forty or more years of frequent use and passes through the dish washer.
I am very happy with the OXO Good Grips Wire Potato Masher.
It is far superior to the two plastic mashers I bought while trying to replace the old wire style.
I recommend this product highly, and without reservation.
What can you say about a potato masher...It mashes....I bought this one because its a Oxo.
If you use a cheese plane or have plans to use one, this is a good one.
A vegetable peeler is better for making parmesan curls.As usual it has OXO's ergonomic, grippy handle.
I like using this utensil for making cheese slices for an appetizer tray.
It is very sharp and the cheese does not stick to it.
II have bought several items from OXO recently and love them all.
it is simple, cheap and does the job, not the perfect thing you can get of course.
I want to own all of them! LOL! It works great and looks nice.
I like that you can wash it in the dishwasher without worrying it will rust or break over the long run.
Good solid product for a very reasonable price.
Bought this to replace a similar one I'd had for many many years.
I really liked the old one, but had repaired the handle many times & it was now beyond repair.
Just a nice, wafer thin piece of cheese that does not stick to the plane when you try to take it off.
I even use it on blocks of chocolate, to make fast-melting slices when I bake.--Reviewed by M.
Got this as a gift for a foodie in my household.
Oxo kitchen tools (and toys) have great handles, and they're also generally good tools.
This is no exception, works nicely for making thin slices on hard or semisoft cheeses.
Good grip with good balance make this a must have for the cheese enthusiast.
I have used various types of cheese slicers over the years and have always found this type the easiest and most efficient.
The handle finally fell off my favorite cheese plane after years of use.
I've been on a search for a good replacement.
This plaine is very sharp and does a great job on the hard and softer cheeses.
This is a great, very easy to use kitchen basic.
It's very easy to hold and handle, and it slices every kind of cheese I've tried it on with no difficulty.
It was a little tricky to run through my Chef's Mate, but it's working a little better now.
I'm thinking I'll need to replace it in a year or so.
Still, it was used about once a week for about 4.5 years; if I get another year out of it, that's not too shabby!.
Cutting pizza requires a little extra force to cut the crust, so you don't want a flimsy tool.
This cutter &#34;musters up&#34;, and is both sturdy and easy to grip.
OXO makes great products at a great price.
I have read other reviews where people moan about how large it is.
I admit this might be a pain to sharpen if it was dull, but mine is sharp so no problems there.A great product.
I love the OXO products and this is no exception.
I am a HUGE pizza eater ladies and gentlemen.
Just the sight of one makes my feet weak.
Changed me into the pizza-obsessed feisty wolverine that I've embarrassingly become today.Oh and stay away.
This is *my* pizza!  That's right!  I don't share :)Alright I better write down something serious so amazon doesn't think I'm writing a prank review.
This really is a very good pizza cutter and works splendidly, and HAS been working splendidly for over 10 years now.
There's a reason this particular model is so popular.
I don't know what I expected but this pizza wheel is large! But it is also the best we've owned in the past 25 years.
High quality construction, great blade, and grate grip, and great price.
What else can I say.I would recommend it to anyone.
have to make sure the kids can't grab it so they don't hurt themselves, but have owned this for a few months and no issues.
This is a great size for cutting deep-dish pizza and the angled/off-set handled keeps you away from all that hot cheese.
It is nice and sharp and holds up will in the dishwasher.
This thing does it's job! It cuts a mean pizza.
I bought it as a gift but considered stealing it and giving my old one.
Sadly, I decided to be a good friend and let the good one go.
Probably going to buy another one for myself!.
Yeah, it's like the monster truck of pizza wheels, but it works very well.
It has great heft, nicely padded handle, and the wheel just makes slicing up a pizza effortless.
The blade rolls smoothly and it has enough height to cut through thick crusted sicilian style crusts with ease.
Have had this almost a year, and hands down it is the best pizza wheel I have ever used.
I have arthritis so things like this are usually difficult.
This has great grip, great balance (it looks like it should be off but it's not).
Super cutting edge - one pass cuts even thin crispy crusts - which my old cutter took several passes to accomplish.
Most pizza wheels that I've seen are much smaller.
I had to find a new storage space for it but totally worth it.
Boy am I glad I did! This cutter works sooo much better.
I don't know if it's sharper, or if it's because it has more heft, but it cuts right through those pizza crusts, like a charm.
I have also used it to cut pastry and dough and it works really well at that, too.
Definitely a great gadget every kitchen should have.
Yeah it cuts pizza, and makes a handy pinwheel when you are really bored and want to risk cutting yourself.
It cuts pizza very nicely and is a good size.
Sharper than my old one, larger, and definitely easy to use.
I like it and it's holding up well.
Chose this because of the brand and our generic pizza wheel had never been that good anyway.
This pizza wheel is so much bigger and nicer than the little $2 pizza cutter I had that I uploaded a picture for comparison.
First of all, it's huge and makes quick work of even your deepest deep dish pizza.
You hardly have to apply any force at all.
It has a very nice weight and quality feel to it.
It may be the last one you buy.
The actual wheel is very sturdy and does not wiggle.
Its heft and size means its very easy to cut through pizza.
The handle is very comfortable and can be held easy with an overhand or underhand grip.
I also use this tool to cut through other flat food items.
What more can I say about a pizza wheel?  Yes, very sharp and does the job very well.
Works much better than trying to cut a pizza with a knife and pull all the cheese from one side to the other.
works well very good quality made to last cuts right through the pizza with nice clean lines I recomend  it.
Our beloved pizza cutter finally broke after ten years of happily wedded bliss, and so I took to Amazon to find the most highly-reviewed replacement.
I landed on this one!  And then it came in the mail.
Great quality, expect it will last five times longer than our first (somewhat cheap) one did.
It looks like something you'd use in home defense.
I needed a high quality pizza cutter and this is it.
It's a good solid piece that seems like it'll last a long time.
It's big, heavy & sharp; goes through the thickest of deep dish and the thinnest of thin crust.
The handle is soft and grippy and has a hanging hole.
We have had this cutter for around 6 months now and I still love it.
I use it for pizzas as well as cutting dough and simple pastas.
It still works just as well as the first time we used it.
This is a replacement for the oxo pizza wheel we had thrown out by mistake.
I really like the cutting ability of this pizza wheel, and appreciate its size while I'm cutting things, but it is REALLY large.
Only real downsize here is that it is a pain to find space to store in the utensil drawer.
I frequently find it to be the culprit in the &#34;stuck kitchen drawer&#34; problem.
If you don't mind that issue, it really is a very sharp and easy to use pizza cutter.
It really is a professional kitchen tool, and it easily cuts an extra-large pizza with little effort.
Has done fine in the dishwasher.It is a bit wobbly during use, but, I'm cutting a pizza, not walking a tightrope.
when given the choice, i always buy oxo.
this pizza wheel is great, sharp, and cuts clean.
even if i didn't find it at $3.99, i would have bought it at bed, bath, and beyond for cheaper with their 20% off coupons.
amazon, if you want to stay competitive, price your items lower!.
Like other OXO Good Grips, the feel is great and the quality is rock solid.
This pizza wheel is of excellent quality for the money paid.
It has a big wheel and cuts through everything.
I love this pizza cutter! The grip is great and blade is awesome! This pizza cutter is very easy to clean.
A pizza cutter isn't something you think about all that often until you need one.
Not only does Pizza Hut never cut my pizzas all the way through, but frozen ones don't come with any slice cuts at all.
Missed a lot and created too many super narrow slices.
This little guy does it perfectly in one pass, so I'm a fool for having waited so long to buy one.
Huge!  Just like the pros use at the pizza restaurants.
Works like a charm, even on thick crusts.
This is my second pizza cutter in my entire life.
It is everything I thought it would be and more.
I love the grippy handle and the huge wheel.
I use it on my home made pizza.
Yes, I make the dough from scratch along with everything else.
I don't buy pizza from the store or from chains, so I don't know how it would work on other pizzas.
I think that if it was used on store-bought pizza it might be comparable to cutting through a cardboard box.
That is not what this item is designed to do.
Keep in mind that I also make whole wheat dough and like it extra crispy.
I like to make pizza with lots of veggie toppings, and it slices right through every time.
Whether or not you have to go back and forth seems to be dependent upon how crunchy you like the bottom of the crust.
A softer crust slices easily with one pass.
(Spray the cutter lightly with no-stick spray before using, and cheese, etc.
I just wish there was a bigger hand guard in front of the blade.
This item is a must for artisan pizza lovers.
I have on occaision used it to cut biscuit and cookie dough as well.
This pizza cutter is comfortable on the hands, and does its job of cutting pizza well.
You will not need second swipes, and the amount of pressure needed to cut the pizza is modest, a blessing for those with older hands.
It also does a fine job on Quesadillas, or so my son tells me.
It far surpasses using a knife to cut pizza.
Finally, it far surpasses the quality of the store-brand pizza cutter we previously used.
My old one just wasn't doing its job anymore.
I make my own pizzas and this slices nicely thru thick and thin crusts.
Purchased upon cooks illustrated's recommendation , have used it 4 times, so far so good.
This zester is easy to use and comes in handy.
Makes nice little shreds of citrus peel to use in recipes.
Nice lil zester!! I'm still learning how to use it quickly but it's been great so far and the handle is great!.
The lemon zester from OXO, like so many of their products, is a triumph of function and form.
The perfect lemon zester:  nothing more, nothing less.
The OXO "Good Grips" Lemon Zester has a very good grip indeed.
It has a fat handle that gives your hand good leverage when using the single tooth to get long fat strips of lemon zest.
This tool would also work with unripe papaya to shave into pickled preserves or other papaya recipes.
It's not the fastest zester, but it's a lot simpler to clean after using, compared to any larger screen-type grater.
Great little zester, as I expected from OXO.
I also wish the channel knife was a little sharper, but that's easily remedied with a metal needle file.
I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 for any of you who care).
But the  OXO only gives you the best of the lemon as it stainless steel blade cuts  sharply and cleanly.
The zester is quite durable and goes  through the dishwasher quite well too.
We love them, for zesting and peeling citrus fruits.
If you need a zester this is probably one of the best.
It even curls the lemon peel if you like to make fancy desserts or drinks.
This kitchen  tool does all that is expected of it and oxo never lets anyone down.
Love the sharp teeth on this.Fabulous for making limeade.
A simple tool that adds so much to a drink.
Purchased the OXO lemon zester and like other OXO products, very good.
Tried a couple of supermarket $2.00 ones and that's exactly what they were, $2.00 ones.
For a few bucks more get the OXO, it actually works well.
It's very comfortable to hold and extremely sturdy.
It's not meant to zest for cooking, though, especially if you need fine/small pieces.
I've been looking everywhere for this type of zester.
I was a little worried that the handle was going to be too big for my small hands because it is fat.
I have a much skinnier handled one already.
Well, it works like a charm, even better than the skinny handled one I have.
I normally use it to garnish a Sazerac.-3 oz rye whiskey-3/4 oz simple syrup-Peychaud bitters to taste-absinthe or absinthe substitute-Lemon twist for garnish.
I buy a lot of OXO good grips items, and I'm never disappointed.
Well made and easy to use, I always love them.
This is my first and I appreciate the price and quality.
It makes the job very easy and the size of the zest depends on how big your strokes are.
You can make them pretty small too.Other reviews make a good point emphasizing that it does miss some spots.
Before purchasing this nifty little zester, I would always leave the zest out of any recipe that called for it.
Whenever I tried to use a grater, the colored zest would stick inside the holes.
You run it lightly over the surface of the peel, and it makes ultra-thin strips of colored zest.
The tool is easy to control, and a snap to use.
I use mine to make non-bitter-tasting orange, lemon, and lime zests for homemade sorbets, ices, and ice creams.
this little tool enables you to add another, fresh dimension to yourcooking.
The bright, sharp tang of citrus peel is a wonder in dozensof dishes.
Those striped cukes that you see on salad trays are done this way.
You can also use the strips themselves as decorative additions to stir-fries, pasta dishes and soups.OXO is well known for their ergonomic grips.
I love how the orange rind comes of in spaghetti like strands.
I dry these in the dehydrator to produce a wonderful aroma throughout the house.
Works well as a zester and making twists for martinis.
But my daughter found a new purpose for it!  Scraping out the seed of pumpkins and winter squash, works like a dream.
Its ergonomic design and big, pressure-absorbing, outstanding non-slip grip, complete an oversized hole for easy hanging, allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use.
I know this zester is a simple little kitchen item to have and shouldn't much matter, but it does.
I know it sounds silly but if you use this item frequently it is worth the purchase.
Got it for my home bar set, looks like a quality product.
My whole life, I've always used a sort of grating tool made for zesting.
When I first heard about a zester, I was intrigued.
I promptly went out and bought one to remove lemon peel for Lemon Meringue Pie.
The zester has fine holes which are sharp and cut into the peel.
This results in fine strips of citrus peel which may then be chopped.
If you want to obtain small pieces without having to chop the zest, just pull the sharp edge across a small section at a time.
I start at the top of the citrus fruit and wind my way around to the base.
The white pith is very bitter.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.
This zester lasted over 11 years! I'm having to buy a new one since the metal finally snapped off the handle.
I haven't found an OXO kitchen tool that I have yet to like or think is better than any other brand I've used.
I give this 5 stars for a reason.
I really like this zester, it feels good in my hand and it works well.
This is among the best of the OXO tools I've owned.
It has exceptional sharpness and is a pleasure to use.
Any serious cook who uses zest should strongly consider this tool.
I find I have to *push* hard to get thru thick orange and lemon rinds.
I have found that the microlane grater is easier and more versitile.
I have used a couple times and it works great ! ! !.
The potato comes out evenly mashed, not lumpy.
It is a much better option comparing to traditional potato mashers since it preserves a texture of potato without making it queue.
My daughter told me I needed to get one of these to make mashed spuds in.
It does work really good!  The spuds come out very creamy and it works nice.
It is stainless and although the basket is small, it works just fine.
Ricing is the way to go and this one is of good quality and a decent value.
This one was old and rusty, so I decided to buy a new one instead.
I got this Oxo one and am very pleased with the outcome!  I get the ultimate light and fluffy  mashed potatoes with this.
I have some arthritis and tendonitis in the hands/forearms, so I found this a little hard to use if I filled the hopper clear full.
By filling halfway, I did not have as much trouble.
The first time I used it I did not peel the potatoes, and I believe this also contributes somewhat to the difficulty in pressing.
The next time I peeled the potatoes and found it easier.
Also, the peeling tends to clog the holes in the hopper and needs dumping often, which slows down the process.
I held my breath a little at the price, but I do believe it is worth it and would buy this ricer again.
It only comes with one permanently mounted screen, but it is perfect for mashed potatoes.
Every chef says the best mashed potatoes are made with a ricer so I treated myself to this one.
I found the handles a little uncomfortable...silicone or rubber on them might help.
But using the ricer is much more consistent than mashing...not a chance of lumps so they're very very smooth.
Decent capacity and relatively easy to use, although I now wish I had bought the one with the compound leverage for easier squeezing.
I did not imaging there was a ricer until I saw this on a Martha Stewart cooking show.
She was showing off some monster size ricers.
However I always choose "OXO Good Grips" as the tool of choice.So far just did the mashed potato thing.
This works well however a good old fashioned masher works as well for me.
Now I see for other reviews that there are more uses and a whole new world is opening for me and my ricer.
I had my doubts about this item because it felt a little flimsy when I removed it from the box.
It's lightweight and the handles seemed a little small.
However, it worked flawlessly and made super-smooth mashed potatoes.
But the consistent smoothness is well worth it.
You also must remove the peel each time you press (that's where the messy part comes in.)Recommended!.
The only small problem is the cup size, on the small side if you are doing potatoes for more than just the family.
It is dishwasher safe and it is already a very good point.
Great Product as my wife has approved it and she is very picky so I am on her good side.
The OXO Potato Ricer is a great kitchen tool that has held up well for the past 6 years of fairly regular use.
Bid farewell to lumps, and say &#34;Oh, hi there!&#34; to silky smooth starchy goodness.
This works perfect for mashing potato's for gnocchi, I have tried electric mixers and hand potato mashers and none work like this for gnocchi.
If you make gnocchi this is a must have.
If you are buying this just to mash potato use a potato masher or electric mixer if you already have one of those.
This potato ricer is a very sturdy, dependable product.
Rices potatoes quickly and easily, easy to work with and to clean.
It is also fabulous for "ricing" bananas for banana bread.
There was no struggling with this one to unscrew any parts to clean - just tossed it in the dishwasher.
The OXO version has already been used twice in the past two weeks - I'd almost forgotten how well meatloaf goes with mash - yummmm!.
This was great for mash potatoes, carrots and yams.
In general this provides a lot more air into the root that you are trying to mash.
It provides a much softer mouth feel than traditionally smashing does.
If I could only afford one tool for mashed potatoes, I'd opt for the "food mill".
I'm ready!This replaces a 30 year old potato masher that is rusted.P.S.
A few times, the structure of the ricer prevented my overturning the dough or the ricer in my nervousness.
This is a very sturdy and well-built ricer.
This tool is a must-have for preparing mashed potatoes.
My only gripe with this ricer is that some of the potato squishes out over the lid when pressing down on the contents.
I don't think it matters how much or little is in the canister, it's just the way it works.
Other than that, the handles are easy to use and give you great leverage when ricing, even if the potatoes are a little firm.
If you've never used a ricer before, go ahead and get this -- you'll get much fluffier mashed potatoes than by using a masher.
Many people have commented that it is too small, but I can get through 5 pounds of potatoes in no time at all.
In fact, after the comments about it's size, I was expecting it to be smaller than it actually was.
My 10 year old son likes to cook with me and he has to use that method (he can't grip it).
I included a photo so you could see it's size in relation to my hands.
The potatoes come out perfect - no lumps (although I hear some people actually LIKE lumps?).
Anyway, this is a terrific ricer - clean up is easy too.
A simple rinse gets most of the potato residue off and then I put it in the dishwasher!.
Once you use the potato ricer, you will never go back to traditional mashed potato methods again.
Use that extra time you save to concentrate more on the main dish.
I used it for mashed potatoes for Christmas dinner.
I had quite a pile of potatoes and went through them in a jiffy.
I used this ricer and it works great.
I hand wash it as I do all my kitchens tools.
It is made well and has a little weight to it.
of butter and a splash of EVOO and some salt, mix and serve.
If you want the best, smoothest, creamiest and fluffiest mash potatoes you have to buy a potato ricer.
The ricer is simple yet well made, strong and reliable and produces evenly riced potatoes every time.
The handle is ergonomically designed so you can repeat the same operation over and over without strain.
I fit about two cooked potatoes into the ricer cup with no problem.
If you love mash potatoes then a ricer is the way to go.
I got this one particularly to squeeze shredded potatoes dry.
I thought one with holes all around the basket as well would be better, but this product had the best reviews overall.
My hubby is going to like less lumps in his mashed potatoes, since I generally use an old hand masher and fork.
I haven't used it yet, but the press plate lies flush with the grate, the piston appears to be fastened well enough.
My hubby truly enjoys the smooth quality of potatoes riced with this ricer.
I peel and cut my potatoes, so they take a couple of basketfuls to rice but it is still faster than with a hand mashers.
A tip from a cooking tutorial-use a fork to test potatoes for doneness "fork tender", not a knife for better test.
This is absolutely one of my favorite kitchen tools.
I use it to make gnocchi and mashed potato.
The tool is kinda heavy...or...heavier than you would expect.
It works great - I've so far used it with yukon gold potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots and turnips and everything has worked just fine.
Even though it's fairly small, processing the foods goes pretty quickly and it's easier to use than the larger ones I've tried.
Easy to clean, dishwasher safe but I usually wash by hand, which is also easy to do.
I've used this every couple of days since I got it and I'm very fond of it.
I haven't found any other way to duplicate the texture this gives, although I have and use a blender, food processor and very nice knives.
I never bought the ricer for ricing potatoes.
Instead, I bought it to squeeze the juices from raw potatoes to make hash browns and potato pancakes.
I have also used it lately to rinse water from herbs and other soft leafy vegetables before chopping.
I like it.Works on food products other then potatoes Fast delivery.
use it mainly for hash browns and zuchini bread.
Easy to scrape the holes clean then pop it in the dishwasher.
This is a handy tool for making very fluffy mashed potatoes.
You put in a peeled, boiled spud, push down on the lever, and out comes what we called "riced" potatoes in the past.
These are the lumpy fresh noodles that are common in German and Austrian food.
Rinse the ricer with some cold water before filling to prevent a sticky mess.
When the noodles float up (only a few minutes) you can scoop them out with a slotted spoon and drain.
Except, the wurst are hard to find in the US unless you live in parts of Pennsylvania or Wisconsin.
Since I have had this potato ricer, I have been making the best mashed potatoes I have ever made.
It is a good size and is very easy to use.
It is nice and strong, and fits comfortably in my hand.
I found six medium potatoes made a nice bowl of mashed potatoes for two.
I'm seriously impressed with the Oxo potato ricer and highly recommend it!.
Simple, well made and should last a lifetime when used properly.
Still waiting on them.I have learned that whenever the wife wants a kitchen gadget to always search Amazon first.
The heck with going to stores, calling around or asking.
IF you can't find it here, you probably cannot find it in a store.
It's a ricer, there isn't a lot of magic going on here to report on.
The quality is consistent with other OXO products I have.
Great balance, great feel and great non-slip grips make this the best potato ricer I've owned to date.
I used this potato ricer to make gnocchi.
I found it a bit awkward to hold and use, especially compared to other OXO products, which are usually designed to be extremely ergonomic.
great for making gnocchi! that's what i ordered it for.
I LOVE I LOVE I LOVE this gadget and it's not useless!  I know I'll be using this for years to come.
I used itafter purchasing it two weeks ago, finally today for my Easter dinner.
I used it for sweet potatoes and regular potatoes.
In past, I've always mashed them by hands but took a lot of work and time consuming and the veggies managed to come out lumpy.
Cut my time by half plus the veggies were smoother not lumpy and I used less milk or butter or etc.
I cut the potatoes in halved without peeling and boiled them til tender.
Drained water and placed couple of them in the ricer at a time.
I hope this ricer will last for a long time.Update 6/10/2013I use it all the time.
I use it for sweet potatoes, apples and bananas, and strawberries.
It still easy to use and easy to clean.
This is my first potato ricer and I'm very happy that I did the research to find a good one.
I was looking for something to squeeze juice from wet pulp left behind by my juicer.
I boiled my unpeeled potatoes whole, removed them from the pot and cut them in 1/2.
I then drop 1/2 the potato in the ricer with the cut side down and squeeze.
All the potato goes in the bowl leaving the skin behind which comes out easily and then I continue with the next 1/2 potato.
My 6 year old granddaughter was fascinated and helped me do the squeezing.
My worries about this hurting my arthritic hands was for naught.
Clean up is a breeze if I do not let the potato dry on the ricer.
I still want to try it on my wet juice pulp.
I hate wasting any valuable, delicious and nutritious juice.
I do continue to use it for ricing potatoes.
This is a solid, easy to use ricer at a great price.
You would pay more for a ricer of this quality at a home store.
In addition to ricing potatoes, this works great to get the excess water out of frozen spinach and to puree garlic cloves!.
I wish I&#8217;d invested in a potato ricer years ago.
Best $25 I&#8217;ve ever spent!My old method of whipping up mashed potatoes &#8211; namely, a hand mixer &#8211; was a nightmare.
The dogs, both terrified by mom&#8217;s breakdown and enticed by the crumbs scattered all over the place, were nearly as stressed as I was.
With limited storage space, I&#8217;m hesitant to buy kitchen utensils that only have a single, narrow use.
It takes a little while, but overall it&#8217;s much easier than using an electric hand mixer.
TRUST ME.) The potatoes come out the other side in stringy, noodle-like segments.
After you&#8217;re done processing all the mashed potatoes, add your soy milk and margarine as you would normally and stir.
Plus it will filter out the skins, so there&#8217;s no need to peel your potatoes either.
I was a bit nervous about buying the OXO model, since I couldn&#8217;t tell from the pictures exactly how it opened up.
(Though fitting it into a dishwasher is a little trickier, especially when open!) The construction is sturdy, with a stainless steel body and padded handles.
I&#8217;ve only had it a few weeks, but it looks like it will last a long while.5/5 stars.
I couldn&#8217;t be happier with my new kitchen gadget!.
Results will be the same as 4 star restaurant prepares.
Was a gift for my grown son and same as the one I use at home.
This makes mashed potatoes so much more creamy and no lumps.
It is alot easier that mashing it by hand and I think easier than pulling out the blender.
Saw it on the cooking shows and gave it a try.
After reading a recipe on making perfect mashed potatoes, which recommended a ricer, I bought this.
It is easy to use, one small potato at a time, for a creamy uniform consistency.
TIP: pour the boiling potato water through it before mashing...keeps the potatoes hot.
I use this for straining tincture, with cheesecloth as a layer between.
Im sure it works great for potatos too!.
I had never used one of these in the past but OMG they make the creamiest mashed potatoes I have ever had.
Great for camping too because you do not need electricity to use.
Kids also got a real kick out of watching the potatoes &#34;squish&#34; out.
This ricer does a great job on potatoes and it is a good size for a two person family.
Because my daughter is a HUGE fan of mashed potatoes I finally broke down and got a ricer for perfect potatoes every time.
If you're not mashing potatoes with a ricer, you're missing out.
This was my second ricer, after I bought the cheapest one I could find at a local kitchen supply store.
The handle on the cheap ricer bent the very first time I used it.
This one is much more sturdy, which is really all you need in a ricer.
I bought this initially because my wife had a minor jaw surgery and I needed to mash up her veggies.
I used to consistently for about a month as she was recovering and it was always super simple to use.
Since I've had this ricer they have been on the menu much more frequently.
I purchased this to make baby food based on all the positive reviews.
The large size is great for leverage and making large batches of food.
The hinges are all sturdy, and the metal construction makes this very realiable.
I bought this as a gift for my mom for Christmas.
She wanted a potato ricer to help make even smoother mashed potatoes.
The hinge is very strong, and even with hard potatoes I was able to squeeze hard and there was never any stress.
The plunger fits perfectly into the ricer, and the grips on the handles help keep a strong grip.
It's sturdy and you can rice the potatoes without peeling them.
The only thing I think could be improved on is if it had holes along the side as well.
When you rice the potatoes it does have a tendency to push mashed potato over the top of the ricer.
If it could go out the side as you rice them, it wouldn't do that.
And to be perfectly honest, it really didn't make much of a difference in mashing the potatoes.
They were pretty much the same as they were when I didn't rice them.
So, if you hate peeling potatoes, you can use this prior to mashing and you don't have to peel them.
this thing works great but is small so beware.
if your using it for potatoes then think again unless it's just for one.
I've had this stainless steel ricer for over a year now, and it looks as good now as it did when it came new.
My husband and I were fighting over who got to use it first.
Whatever I thought I knew and liked about mashed potatoes was wrong.
The handle is not as ergonomic (read: comfortable to hold) as I have come to expect from OXO.
It does this not matter how much or little potato you add.
I think its just eh way it was designed.
It's not the end of the world and I'm not a very neat cook in the kitchen anyway.
If making a mess while cooking makes your eye start to twitch, you may want to check out another ricer.
OXO designs great products and this is no exception.
It does the job well and the ergonomics put it over the top.
I just don't understand how anyone could have a problem with this product -- it does exactly what it's meant to do with ease.
I liked it so much, I bought one for my aunt.Before this, I made mashed potatoes with a masher; the difference is unbelievable.
ITS HARD TO GET ALL THE LIQUID OUT OF SOME VEGIES.
ITS BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE A GOOD PORTION.
There are no Waffle Houses in our area and that was usually where I got my hashbrown fix.
You grate your potato while the pan is heating --with butter or light olive oil.
You use the ricer to squeeze out all the excess moisture.
You scoop the potato shreds out and then spread in the pan (with or without onions).
Season and cook until crispy and golden.I couldn't be happier.
In the last two days I've made hashbrowns 4 times.
The Oxo ricer has been easy to hand clean, and in general I've had no problem.
I will note though that there are no side holes which means that some of the fluid accumulates above the plunger.
I also don't think that it would necessarily come as clean by putting it in the dishwasher.Pam T~mom/chief bottle washer and cook.
Are you tired of lumpy mashed potatoes?  Look no further.
This little baby will take your potato and squirt it out in 143 streams of creamy mashed potatoes.
Solid construction, but boil the potatoes before you stick them in the ricer.
I only wish that the handles were about three inches longer for easier use.
The ricer is very well made, as are most OXO Good Grips products and it works perfectly.
A few more inches in handle length would make this device perfect and earn it 5 stars.
This OXO potato ricer makes great mashed potatoes.
I use it whenever I don't feel like having chunky mashed potatoes for dinner, otherwise I use the regular masher.
At first I thought this was one of those gadgets that eventually gathers dust in the kitchen but I was wrong.
It's very easy to use and easy to clean.
I find it even easier to clean than my potato masher.
I have the Oneida with an inch-thick nylon head and the potatoes get stuck in between the grids.
Just flush with running water and everything comes out.
I've never had a problem with the handles bending, either.
I will also use it for bananas for banana bread.
Bananas are easy to mash with a fork but if you have to mash 20 then it takes time.
I will also use it for baby food in the future when I have babies.
I have never been able to make hashbrowns, now I can.
I don't even need to use oil in the pan.
I dump hashbrown "puck" directly out of the ricer and cook it right up.
I have not tried to make potatoe pancakes yet, but I am looking forward to that too.
I first bought this to squeeze out the juice from potatoes when making hash browns but its first use was actually making mashed potatoes.
For that purpose it works great, mashed potatoes are very fluffy using this and it is very easy to use.
My kids love watching me make it and like using it themselves.
Then I do a quick wash with dishwashing detergent.
It's time to make a freshly made mashed potatoes...easy and convenient.
Not only potatoes but other root crops as well like carrots and yams.
Okay, who has room for yet one more kitchen utensil?!!  Seems like those tools in my drawer just multiply over time.
so I finally ordered one of these Oxo potato ricers, and am SO glad I did.
My mom never had one of these, nor my mother-in-law.
My family & friends went on and on about those potatoes!!  Life is good.
hey, also, I have a new grand daughter and this thing works great for pureed foods for her!  Get one, you will not regret it.
It's only my husband and me, now that our girls are grown.
I wanted something that would do the job, but in less time.
My husband often helps with the cooking and, he was was really impressed with this gizmo.
It had great reviews and they were all right about it.
It's heavy duty and really easy to use.
It will get a good workout in my kitchen.
I have heard for quite some time how wonderful Potato Ricers are.
They process the Potato in one squeeze, and prevent over mixing and creating glue when using a stand mixer.
I decided to see for myself if I preferred riced potatoes.
The first time I used the OXO Ricer, the Potatoes came out creamy and delicious.
The texture was different than whipped Potatoes, and the flavor was more &#34;natural&#34;.
I didn't need to stir in as much butter or cream as I usually would when I used the stand mixer.
I now use the Ricer every time I make Mashed Potatoes, and really enjoy this new method.
The OXO Ricer is easy to use, easy to clean, and the padded grips prevent hand cramping if you are processing a larger batch.
It rices beautifully, and is easy to clean and store.
Very reasonable cost, and the usual good OXO value.
I wasn't paying attention when I ordered this.
It's very small, so time consuming to prepare potatoes for a family size meal.
As a mashed potato connoisseur I will attest that nothing produces smoother or more fluffy mashed potatoes than a ricer.
I can comfortably, and relatively quickly, mash up to 10 lb.
I bought this in 2006 and it still works great and makes the best potatoes.
I never use the mixer anymore! Also I use this little gem on juicing my pomegranites for jelly!  It is great.
Put about 1/2 to 3/4 cups seeds in and squish then discard the pulp.
The best possible mashed potatoes without peeling!  This is high in quality and function.
The consistency of potatoes 'mashed' with this ricer is smooth - perfect.
And for an especially easy time, just use baked potatoes - you get more flavor, softer potatoes to squeeze through, and less clean up!.
Easy clean-up, I just put it in the dishwasher.
Regardless I took the plunge and I must say it has been a worthwhile purchase.This ricer produces consistently smooth potatoes.
I have also used it with sweet potatoes, acorn squash, squeezing liquid from spinach and grated jalapeno and to juice lemons.
Very light and fluffy product you get when ricing potatoes.
The Oxo Good Grips Potato Ricer is the first one I've ever owned.
It is a little messy and it is important to keep the potatoes warm after ricing and mixing in butter, milk, sour cream or whatever.
The ricer tends to be a little sloppy.
I was helping my niece set up her new home and we were trying to buy a lot of things for not that much money.
I think it's so important to have good knives - but when I went looking - the really good ones were SO much money.
Well, I was so impressed, I had to buy a set for myself as well.
These are the knives I reach for everyday.
At this price, I can't imagine any home without them!.
My daughter received these knives as a wedding gift and they are used more than any in her kitchen.
Picking Crab is such a pain in the behind but this is a nice set.
I also use the spoon ends to dig out the tops of strawberries.
If you have ever tried eating lobster or crab without the proper utensils you know what a trial it can be.
These are the perfect tools for getting at the good stuff!.
It also serves multiple purposes and helps save space in an urban area.
This works really well for crab legs night.
They pickers help you get every last bit of goodness out of the crab legs.
It is very heavy duty and comfortable though and does just fine.
The only modification I'd recommend to OXO would be to design the cracker to come closer together at the hinged end.
I'd still get it again though if anything happened to it.
High quality and sturdy for lobster and crab mealtime.
Add another cracker to make the process go faster.
The spoon/forks work well but not as well as expected.
I bought for a shower gift for a bride whom lives down south.
I used these at a local crab feed.
Amazing!  They work so great - both the scoop end and the fork end for getting all the crab out.
Only improvement would be all stainless steel with no plastic, but for the price I would definitely recommend them.
Classy enough to use as a gift item.
Very high quality set at very good price.
We have two and have given 2-3 as gifts.
The forked design works much better than the curved single-tine picks and the spoon scoop end easily finishes the job.This set is expensive.
Many sets are available for half or less.
I have not compared the quality of the cheaper sets, so maybe these are really worth the extra.
I bought these for a crab feed that hasn't happened yet.
But so far they seem alot easier to hold and handle than my old ones.
These make cracking a lovely little lobster effortless.
The grip is very comfortable in your hand and the cracker is substantial.
Not being on the chain, you can also open it with your arms extended; this comes in handy when you are opening cat food.
This also does not require you to be so dexterous.
It was time to invest in a good one.
OXO has always done me good and I didn't have any hesitation purchasing something from them.
Maybe I am jumping the gun, but for some reason I will not be surprised if it happens.
I have been avoiding the dishwasher just to be safe.
Overall, for the price and the amount I use it I am very happy and feel you will be too.
Just don't expect to have this around in 4 years.
I have bought this kind of opener for some time now.
It was a good thing that I ordered again because my old one of more than ten years broke down.
When I was a kid, my parents went through more electric can openers than I care to count; high complexity, dubious reliability.
The all-stainless construction means no fear of dishwashers, though you'll want to keep metal utensils from banging into the blade.
The rubber handles are very comfortable, and the big fat plastic crank handle handily rotates the can with no contortions whatsoever.
The OXO can opener isn't that different in basic design from any other manual can opener.
You close the blade-and-gear assembly over the edge of a can, grasp the handles, and turn the crank-thingie.
The handles are those wonderful thick soft rubber OXO handles, which are great for hands with arthritis or tendonitis.
The crank is large as well, although plastic not rubber, giving plenty of leverage and failing to dig into sensitive skin or tendons.
This seems to be a theme with their products, in our experience at least.
I for one wouldn't mind paying an extra dollar or two in order to get something that would last longer and wouldn't break down.
When you live in Louisiana, after Katrina, you get prepared.
Even in the northern part where so many people sought temporary shelter, you follow the Boy Scout motto.
Because of the frequent thunderstorms that are part of hurricane periphery, one must take into account that electricity will go out.
This is true of the entire year, not just hurricane season.I keep an assortment of emergency equipment and supplies to make myself independent.
Of course, with sardines, you just peel back the top, drain, dump, and eat.
Add crackers, pickles, onion, cheese, and that white wine that is quite drinkable at room temp.
Pluck some grapes from the fridge and time to eat, thanks to Oxo Can Opener!.
I have one of these at home and one of these for my office because I liked it so much.
The handle is easy to grip and hold onto, and the blade is just sharp enough to open any cans easily.
Can also bring it with you camping, etc.
Nice and sharp - easy to turn the handle - opens cans easily - highly recommend!.
I bought this opener for my son who has difficulty opening can because of his arthritis.
This is a great and easy to use can opener.
The grips aren't really necessary, but they are nice.
The can opener turns really easily, and it  requires little force.
Almost as easy as an electric can opener.
I have owned this can opener for 3 years now and I am still mostly happy with it.
It features comfortable rubber grip handles and an ergonomicle hand crank (my favorite part).
Due to the design, I notice less stress and strain on my hands and wrists using this product than I had with cheaper models.
I have not noticed any rusting or other problems as far as functionality is concerned.
The rubber handles have loosened a bit and slide down occassionally, but this has not been problematic as of yet.
My 12 year old left-handed daughter has never been able to open a can with a regular can opener.
We have tried and tried through the years.
Many people told me I would be handicapping her to buy her left handed friendly items, but I finally gave in.
She loves to cook, and this was a pain point for her.
I read that this model was left-hand friendly, so I picked it up for her.
She used it today, and she was so excited.
It was a nice clean cut, and the handle was nice and large for her hand.
I am hoping it will last her through several years, but we will have to wait and see.
It also shredded a bit of the label, which ended up in the food to be picked out.
I guess that can be easily solved by peeling off the label before we open the can.
This can opener works sooo easily!  I like manual can openers, but some of them are a pain to operate.
This Good Grips opener works as good as the other Good Grips products that I have tried.
"Desprately Needing A Can-Opener", might be the title of a small household dilemma I was facing a few weeks ago.
76370R -- which has since been replaced by Model No.
76370P -- which HAS to be a better machine), had broken.
Good riddance, really, as it was really difficult to position a can to be cut by it, and,.
"once the can was opened / a little splash of any liquid / in / the can / would come / a final sting".
It had cost me some money at the local supermarket, and I guess it didn't start "spitting out" until the warranty period was over.
I'm a native New York Citier who was living IN NYC, (Queens), when 9/11 occured.
It also can, (if desired), give something of a history lesson, to people who have a mind for these things.
Jenny is coming out of her frame, to give a kiss to Joe.
Although I haven't had my can-opener long enough to know, they say that, repeated use, the gears can get rusty after a year or so.
I trust other Amazon reviewers -- especially those who write with such earnestness as these people do.
So -- I think I'll carefully rinse, (and dry!), my OXO GOOD GRIPS CAN OPENER WITH BOTTLE-OPENER, after each use, from now on.
My suggestion here is tht you do the same.
This was recommended by America's Test Kitchen and I just love it.
It is very easy to use with no stain your hands.
I have used it for years and it is still working GREAT.
I prefer using this can opened to an electric.
It is easy to use and comfortable to hold.
The large black knob on this can opener enables it to rotate very easily, and without much effort.
It also has soft gripping handles, and is not to heavy.
Would definitely recommend to others and / or reorder when its time to.
I consider this Oxo can opener the new base standard for can openers against which all others should be compared.
So it works much better than any other can opener.
You might pay more now, but it seems like this one will last much longer than the easily-rusted, cheap metal ones I've had before.
This is a really good handheld can opener....I prefer electric but my son does not so this fit the bill.
Thats not often the case with these type openers.
We replaced a much less expensive manual opener with this.
The difference in the way the handle turned was amazing.
The Oxo is smooth and easy to operate.
This is a great item when I want to juice one or two fruits, preferably small citrus such as lemons or limes.
Quick mix later and I had a great, refreshing sip of something healthy (minus the sugar I guess) that I got to make myself.
I went with this over the wooden for aesthetics, and it does a great job.
No slipping and good on all kinds of citrus.
Hard to wash the wood after it's been used a while and the wood is no longer smooth.
These are excellent for grilling and far superior to all those specialty grill tongs that hardly bend.
These are very long, 12&#34; are a bit more useful in the kitchen, these are better for grilling.
Love using these tongs! For the quality they are very reasonably priced.
Locking feature is great and the steel is thick.
I bought the 12 and 9 inch, so far I'm using the 9 inch the most while cooking.
I like the gripping capability of these tongs.
They grab and hold meats and vegetables well.
I like the pull/push locking mechanism on top which also has a hole for hanging when not in use.
I also like the stainless steel finish and the sturdy construction.
I've had it for a few years now and still works like new.
The Good:  These tongs are cheap and adequate.
I needed a long pair of tongs with metal ends to work in the grill and hot pans and this this did the trick.
They open and close with ease, just like the smaller versions you can buy.
Additionally, arms of the tongs are well made.The Bad:  The ends of these tongs are very thin and mine came twisted a slight bit.
It all gave the impression of being slightly cheaply made, but for $15 you get what you pay for.
These replaced some cheap tongs I had that were too flimsy to pick up a chicken leg without collapsing.
I also bought the 12 inch tongs after using these.
Locking mechanism makes them easier to store and carry.
They are a better size than my last ones and have nice rubber grips.
Got these to replace them and these are stainless steel so I am very happy with them.
The spread-open nuisance is no longer necessary and I, for one, very much appreciate the change.
They lock closed so are easy to store.
And they don't slide out of your hand because of the rubber-like grip on the handle.
Finally, a workable set of tongs for my grilling.I believe these are the best available for the following reasons:a.
The lock makes the tongs easy to usec.
We love this item, we have a couple where the ends were criss-crossed and the metal was thin.
This is a good quality, the ends meet correct, and it is a perfect size/length for most cooking.
Reasonably priced and high quality with the additional pull lock for easy storage.
These make great "gifts" too as sets, ie: 9", 12", etc.
My mom never used tongs like these when I was growing up, so I never thought of getting a pair.
I don't know how I ever did without them.
What can you say about OXO products, they're great.
These are easy to use, go in the dishwasher for complete cleaning and are easy to handle.
If they break or if there is an issue, OXO stands behind their products.
I've bought a few years ago for my wife then for my mother-in-law.
We're still using these tongs (9-inch, 12-inch ones) and they are in excellent shape.
I bought these as a gift for my sister-in-law.
I also bought a 16 inch for my BBQ grill since the one I have for BBQ grill is not good to use.
These are not too long, perfect for kitchen use.
I bought the 12&#34; size 6 years ago and they are still serving me well.
Spontaneous locking is not a problem with these.
Most at this price don't grip, don't line up straight, and bend easily.
They are sturdy, line up, grip well, and the locking mechanism actually works when not in use.
If I had 3 hands, I would have bought three.
They are just the right length for just about any use.
We put off buying a new pair of long tongs for years because of our bad experiences with them.
They always broke within a few uses because of terrible quality.
This pair is durable and I was pleasantly surprised.
We can now enjoy backyard BBQ without having to suffer through burns again.
I have had these for a couple years, and I think I use them almost every day.
The locking feature is really handy, and easy to activate or deactivate--even with messy kitchen hands.
The rubber is comfortable and gives you a sturdy, cool grip.I have one minor complaint, the tongs don't work well with delicate things.
For example, with chicken parmesan, the breading rips right off.
Now, we'll eat anything, so it isn't a big deal to us.
I did notice that OXO makes a set of tongs that have rubber on the ends which may protect delicate foods.
Google about the problem and warnings from government agencies.The solution is to keep bird frozen and then put directly into oven.
After reaching a certain temp you are then able to remove the giblet package with tongs, using a fork can break the bag.
If not removed the bag will later break at higher temperatures.
Locking tongs help make removal an easy task.Non locking tongs can be temporarily made to lock with rubber band around the handle grip.
Thought I was nuts to pay such a price for tongs, but after using them it wasn't nutty at all.
The over-all quality is outstanding, the "look and feel" is great, and this item does its job really well.
This one has a nylon locking tab which is smooth.
I don't know if I could rate any tongs as &#34;I love it&#34; haha.
I have several of this tongs and recommend them if they have the metal center clip (the plastic ones break).
These 16&#34; ones are great for the grill were you don't want to get you hand in the fire.
Stainless Steel, with rubber grips, and a clever locking mechanism built into the end.
Good, Heavy-Gauge stainless steel won't easily get bent out of shape picking up heavy stuff.
These tongs are so nice that I just ordered a second pair.
I love the fact that they lock and lock very easily.
I used these all the time for indoor as well as outdoor cooking.
They go right in the dishwasher and clean up beautifully.
I have several other pairs of tongs but from repeated dishwasher use, they are starting to become difficult to open and close.
I love OXO products for the quality and durability.
I have several sizes of  OXO tongs for different uses and they all have performed perfectly for many years.
The length is perfect for picking up so many things as well using when cooking.
These are quite short but I prefer that since they do not feel as unwieldly as some I've used.
Also the spring action doesn't feel like you're trying to hang on to it.
Great control to grip all manner of food sizes and densities from boiled collards to frozen grapes.
Easy and gentle on my chronic hand injury.
I love OXO products, and this item is no exception.
With these tongs at the grill, my husband doesn't even need a grill mitt.
they are long and to be honest great! I saw them on a tv show where they were comparing different brands and this one won.
I went on and read about it did a little research and got it.
The Kitchenaid ones don't have that and have a tendency to get hot.
These don't so they get tons more use.
But there is a need the longer ones too - so I actually have both.
I used to have short, wire tongs that I would always get my hands burned with when making a steak or felafel on the stove.
I haven't used these on a grill outside yet, but I'm sure these would be perfect for that.
Push in the tag to release, pull out to lock, which is great for storage and for the dishwasher.
Overall, very happy with the 16'' length vs the 9'' and 12''.
These are for my Son in law who is more than I could have wished for my daughter and grand children.
As a tip, here is how I use the locking OXO Tongs I have many sizes.
Use the locking tongs while they are locked it is much easier.
They lock together so they take up less room in my draw.
Thought the lock was crazy on a set of tongs, but find the lock to be very useful.
I bought about 5 of these just to have on hand while the others are in the dishwasher...love them!!!.
As with most OXO kitchen tools these tongs are quality! They work well, grip tight and provide a long reach for those particularly hot fires!.
Over time I've become a fan of Oxo products.
These tongs have what I have found to be usual Oxo great quality.
I wouldn't buy any Oxo product or any other product from Amazon.com if it had bad customer reviews.
They grip the food quite well and make turning the food on the grill both easy and comfortable.
These are great!  I used them to flip steaks this evening and they worked wonderfully.
I was a little worried about the length (12 inches) but they are not too long and have great balance and weight.
I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.
But these are the tongs that are changing that pattern.
And they look nice enough that you can use them at the table and not be embarrassed.
Perhaps not the easiest tongs in the world to control, but only due to the length, as I would expect.
I bought all three sizes of the Oxo Good Grips Tongs.
I've had all three of my OXO Tongs for years now and have never needed replacing! WELL WORTH the $.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!  These are one of those things I can't live without.
I use them all the time for all kinds of cooking and baking.
Easy locking by simply pulling the little knob at the end of the tongs.
I own a 9&#34; and 12&#34; pair of these.
After a few years of use, the 9&#34; feels like an extension of my hand.
I can do damn near anything with it, and I use them pretty much every time I'm in the kitchen.
9 inch gives me control over the weight balance.
locking mechanism keeps tongs closed in utensil drawer, preventing inter-tangle with other items.
These tongs have nice teeth to grab food with out tearing.
I don't know how long the black grips will last but the metal on the tongs has nice finish and very thick.
The locking mechanism works great and is in the right place on the tongs.
The length makes it easy to get food from the back of the grill.
Tongs are the MOST useful tool in my kitchen.
I use them to: stir fry, turn hot foods on the grill, hold meat while I slice it, etc.
etc.The rubber handles put these tongs over the top.
Get 'em greasy, get 'em wet,  doesn't matter, they won't slip.
Another bonus - where other tongs get too  hot these are fine because the rubber stays cool.
You can safely use these  to fish things out from a pot of boiling water!  Try that with a pair of  all metal tongs.
ouch!I also like the ability to lock them in the  closed position.
We have a pair of these and we just bought another to give as a gift.
We use them all the time and they are great for salad, pasta, on a grill, whatever.
It can handle heavy steaks fine and they wash easily.
We don't put them in the dishwasher so I don't know how it'd handle that cause we always wash these by hand.
Also I've never gotten them so dirty that it was hard to clean them.
my wife and i have bought at least four sets of tongs including two that appeared to have good gripping ability.
i read all the reviews, went for it,and bought it.
what a great pair of tongs! steaks, chicken quarters, even a slab of ribs were no problem.
please take my word for it,in the world of tongs they have no equal!.
I like the extra length; makes them great for the barbecue and still they're not too long for kitchen use.
The only thing that bothers me is that they occasionally open in the dishwasher rather than staying locked.
That's not enough, however, that I wouldn't highly recommend them.
I use them when grilling, to turn asparagus on a baking sheet in the oven, to flip chicken breasts cooking in a skillet.
I can even use them as a tool to grab cereal boxes or pancake mix off a high shelf.
If you spend a lot of time cooking, you need these tongs in your kitchen.
I use these to arrange the charcoal after I dump it out of the starter.
It locks closed for storage and easily opens for use.
16 inches keeps the hot away from my hands.
The right length for grilling and they work well.
I will update if I have any issues with them.
I used to have a 16"-reach set of tongs that I used a lot on the grill.
Unfortunatly, it rusted out and had to be replaced.
I started using my regular short (10-12") tongs on the grill and kept burning my hand reaching for things towards the back.
After shopping the local stores for a replacement, I gave up and ordered this one from Amazon.
It works well as designed, and I especially like the locking mechanism.
My old tongs had that stupid wire ring that was supposed to lock into the notches cut into the handle, but it kept falling out.
You BBQ guys know what I'm talking about.
Anyway, this locking mechanism is a lot better - it's more "push/pull" and works great.
I like this item a lot - now my hands won't get burnt when turning Buffalo Wings on the grill.
The locking mechanism is a wonderful addition to keep closed when not in use.
I saw tv celebs using tongs and decided to try them.
They had not been part of my kitchen toolkit.
Well, how did I get along without them.
I was not sure what length to purchase.
Keeps y our hands away from the heat.
Makes the easier to store and hold in position.
The grip is precise and I am not concerned about the mettle tips ruining anything.
I find that I use it in new ways, sometime like a spatulas to turn thing, or to grab something.
Nice for reaching in the over to adjust foods.
Easy to hold, easy to use.Get a shorter set for smaller jobs.
I use this one mostly for the grill where distance is an advantage.
I have other brands and they don't last long.
They either burn up from the heat or their locking mechanisms fail.
This was part of a wedding gift set.
I have not heard pro nor con about this item from the receiving couple.
These tongs are responsive, easy to use, and easy to clean (I hand wash).
They pick up small bits of stew meat and large chicken breasts.
This is my favorite grill tool (well, this, and the Weber T-Brush).
The cushioned handles ARE non-slip and comfortable, and the tongs are sturdy.
They don't twist when you grab a large steak on the grill.
The locking feature seems common with tongs, but works nicely.They may be dishwasher safe, but I hand wash my stainless tools and knives.
I needed a longer pair of tongs for the grill and these have been perfect.
I have had them for a while now and used them quite a bit.
You have precise control with these and the rubberized grips are very comfortable.
OXO Good Grips products are usually pretty good and these are no exception.
What more is there to say than these are another in the long line of quality OXO products.
The 12-inch tongs replaced a pair of cheap tongs that came apart, quite literally, at the seams.
Easy to use, easy to clean, excellent grip.
Summer is here, which means more of our family's meals shift from our kitchen to our gas barbecue grill, keeping the house cool.
Strong, sturdy tools with appropriate reach are essential.I purchased four brands of 16-inch tongs from Adcraft, Update International, Browne Foodservice, and Oxo.
Each tong is made of brushed stainless steel with a scalloped edge.
The 16-inch length is important to avoid exposing my hands and arms to the grill heat and possible flare-ups.
The only downside with these 16-inch tongs is storage, which is made less convenient without a locking mechanism.
My wife liked this because this tong is easier to close.
I can appreciate that but the spring feels less sturdy.
The spring action is too loose for my preference.
For roughly $15, I'd rather own three pairs of 16-inch tongs than one.
Each tong is rolled into a `U' shape for added strength.
I don't like to grill with mitts or gloves, so I have to pay attention to heat transfer.
This product is typical high quality Oxo Good Grips.
It is perfect cooking tool and one no cook should be without.
I have washed it several times in my dishwasher and notice no rusting or discoloration.
I do wash it on top rack though too.
I love the easy open device on the end.
I just tap it on coun ter and it opens one handed.
These are very sturdy and long enough to give you leverage for that big steak on the grill.
The tongs have long been one of my go-to kitchen items, especially for sauteing/pan frying various foods and for tossing pasta.
The locking mechanism is simple and easy to use.
I had a smallish pair of tongs for turning eggplant and cutlets while sauteeing.
Tired of burnt fingers, I invested in the locking OXO tongs.
They also work fine on the outdoor barbecue grill, though LONGER tongs would be good if your grill is larger than my puny one.
We want to toss it would work with both salad and pasta.
These tongs are great for grilling! I had looked all over for these.
I have their smaller ones and love them.
I knew OXO made them, but could never find them.Thanks Amazon!.
These are great tongs, as are the silicone tipped ones.
I use these on the grill for some items which my very large grilling tongs can't really grab.
The silicone tongs aren't appropriate for the grill so I use these.
The silicone ones get used on nonstick surfaces.
The bottom lines is I have the tongs I need for all by cooking and baking.
I've finally replaced my archaic tongs with this Oxo Good Grips Tongs.
FIRST OFF YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH ANY OXO ITEM.
QUALITY EVERY TIME!  THESE TONGS ARE SO WELL MADE & I LOVE THE LOCKING MECHANISM.
IF YOUR LOOKING FOR TONGS~ SNAP ONE UP!.
I also purchased the 12 inch locking tongs.
The locking mechanism is simple, and exceptionally useful in keeping these things out of the way when they are not picking stuff up.
I have them in both sizes & with/without the plastic tips.
I use the 9" (smaller) tongs for tossing salads & other non-heat tasks.
I like the long (12"), non-plastic tip tongs for grilling & cooking - the extra length comes in handy when you're over heat.
No more wrapping a rubber band around the tongs to keep them together.
You just pull up on the top lever & they lock shut.
It's also great when cooking to just bump that lever on the counter & they open.
I throw them in the dishwasher to clean.These are used daily in our house & after 5+ years, they still work great.
They are on my short-list of most useful kitchen utensils.
I wash mine by hand usually, but probably not needed.
The product has held up to much use & are a perfect size.
To be honest, I'm pretty neutral about these.
I like the rubber grip at the base and the scalloped edges at the tips.
But when it comes down to it, they are just tongs.
But I don't have anything bad to say.
I've been having a pair of these for years.
The long arms are great for the barbecue pit and very strong.
You can't go wrong with any OXO product.
I have small hands, these tongs are light and just the right size.
I bought them to use with my baby Q grill and they are perfect.
I had a larger tong which I had been using but wanted a smaller one.
This one is the perfect size for my needs and is very well made.
Good quality tongs, sturdy and easy to grip food with.
I call this a good investment for my kitchen.
Excellent precise gripping surface for turning/ moving hot food with a handle that doesn't get hot.
If you have a charcoal grill, this is an awesome product! Move the coals, flip your food, all while not burning your hands!.
I love these tongs! They are very well made and do the job great! I would buy them again and would recommend them to anyone!.
Sturdy and easy to handle, these tongs make it easy to grab, flip, turn or retreive just about anything.
The locking feature is great for storage, making the tongs easy to fit in a drawer.
I purchased these tongs for barbecuing and removing items from the hot pressure cooker.
They work great, and the rubberized grips make them easy to hold and operate.
without stabbing them and losing all the juice into the fire.
I recently burned myself trying to extract artichokes from a pot at a friend's house.
They pick up large artichokes with no problem.
They're long enough to use on the grill.
They wash up in the dishwasher and stay closed in the drawer.
They look good, feel good, and work very well.
I'm very pleased with this item, as I have been with everything else I've gotten from OXO.
OXO is famous for its inventive changes on the old standbys in the kitchen, and this set of tongs is no exception.
As a beginning griller I find them very useful for turning all types of meat.
The locking mechanism helps to save on storage space.
That's all I can really say about kitchen tongs.
They are the best tongs I have ever had.
Very sturdy and the locking device makes it very easy to store them.
Why do I love them?  Because of the way they "feel" in my hand and they way that they store on my utinsil crock.
These are great for any type of kitchens.
It has a grippy rubber handle and a slide lock.
The spoon area is nice and wide for all types of foods (except cooked fish fillet).
In the past, I used the all-metal, cheaper tongs.
the ones that come in a multipack.They worked fine but ended up getting rusty spots.
(Though probably my fault for letting them air dry in the dishwasher.
Ha!)I use other OXO branded items in my kitchen and finally gave in and purchased their tongs.
(Or flip meat on the grill).(3) The locking mechanism at the top? Great.
My old (cheap) metal ones had a sliding rectangular &#34;lock&#34; that would always slide down when I was using them.
Hold the tongs closed and pull up on the hang tab at the top.
Nice!I like these so much I'm buying another one.
These tongs are the perfect length for cooking on the grill.
That is one of my pet peeves of previous tongs that I have owned.
They flex to the point that the object being grasped falls out.
I have not even come close to that point with these.The locking mechanism on the back works great as well.
This is a sturdy, well-made version of a common design.
I'm only holding back one star because I wish they were 100% stainless steel.
I've tried several stainless tongs and this is the best yet.
My previous favorites had the spring rust out after a year or so of heavy use and many trips through the dishwasher.
I think these will hold up better and they have all the features.
Rubber inserts in the handles for a good grip.
Locking tab in the hinge to keep them folded up for storage.
Just the right shape and serrations on the business end for gripping just about anything you would want to use them for.
Yes, I know, you can get tongs anywhere.
They stay closed, well made [stainless steal] and grips are positioned at the right place[not to low or high; have big hands].
Wasn't sure if they would be too long at first but when I got them I found out quickly that they are perfect.
My hands are sensitive to heat and these allow me to turn the meats etc.
without having my hands directly over the heat.
Grips are strong and sturdy and the strips on each side make it super comfy to hold.
Like the little locking feature at the top.
just what i wanted! perfect size! plus better then plastic ends so they dont melt!.
They stay closed when you need them closed, yet are easy to open.
Buy one pair with steel tips, and one with nylon tips.
I like the Oxo tongs quite a bit, which is saying a lot, as I don't think highly of the brand generally.
The ends have a useful bend to them that makes picking up food items easy.
I wish the stainless were just a bit heavier-gauge, but in practice, I haven't had any bending problems.Again, good for 90% of normal kitchen needs.
A longer set of tongs is probably a better choice for grilling, but even there, these are fine for the odd item or so.
These grips are made well and grip tight.
Hey are basic but will do the normal stuff you need them for.
They are also nice and long so if you're BBQ-ing you won't get burned!.
the extended length is perfect for using on the grill.
i've lifted 10lbs chickens with it with zero flex.
I have several pairs of these tongs in various sizes and with different "gripping" materials.
I bought these specifically for my grill and I have not been disappointed.
I have used numerous sets of tongs and these are, by far, the best.
The heads are the most dexterous of any pair of tongs I've found and the locking mechanism is simple and effective.
*****These tongs are sturdy, and fine for all tong tasks.
OXO makes these tongs in the 9-inch, 12-inch, and 16-inch size.
Note that these tongs do NOT have nylon tips at the bottom edges, like another version of OXO tongs that I much prefer.
They should be good to go for any kitchen task.*****.
Oxo Good Grips 16-Inch Locking Tongs should be named Oxo "Great" Grips because that is just how they perform.
They appear to be very well made and I expect to be using them for a very long time.
I own a few of these and could not cook or serve without them.
Highly recommend that you pick up two because you WILL use them.
Okay-- what is all this talk about cooking.
These OXO tongs are more versatile than that.
We use them all over the house, and outdoors as well.
We currently own four pairs.The first usage we put them to is the one you probably expect:  cooking.
As long as they are, they're good for BBQ'ing and working with other hot foods.
They also work for shifting coals and burning branches in an emergency.The second use we have for them are as toys.
I bought two pairs in December for my son and daughter.
They use them constantly (instead of mine) for playing with playdough and as nabber-grabbers.
Nabber-grabbers can be used with Polly Pockets, Thomas the Tank engine, and bean bags if you didn't already know that.
They are long enough I don't have to get my hands 'involved'.
They don't take up a lot of storage space, and they are affordable.
The Oxo Good Grips 12&#34; tongs are great.
They provide a secure grip for both your hands and food you&#8217;re picking up.
Excellent for flipping steaks or turning a 3-5 pound pork loin.
They can be locked in the closed position easily and securely by pulling the tab at the end.
The hinge feels sturdy and gives enough resistance to control what you&#8217;re doing.
Also great to use on a big grill/griddle in a professional kitchen.
I use these in culinary school too and they are great!.
Comfortable in the hand, with just the right "springiness" in the hinge.
Put it in the dishwasher when you're done, lock it closed when you put it away in the drawer (but it won't stay there long).
These are a vast improvement in functionality over a cheaper set of tongs I had.
I also have a barbecue set with some tongs that are so large as to be nearly useless.
These work much better for turning things on the grill.
I have 4 pairs of these and could not cook without them.
For grilling, sauteing, tossing pasta and salads, or grabbing a piece of food from between the grates of the range, they are indispensible.
I can't add much to the previous reviews.
I have very small hands and my husband has very large hands, and we both find these OXO tongs to be very comfortable and versatile.
A must have for any one that grills or smokes.
The long handles and rubber grips keeps hands from getting hot.
I probably use them every day and I love them.
They are stainless steel and so far do not have a spec of rust anywhere.
They lock closed for storage, which is also a very nice feature.
I actually got them as part of a 10-piece utensil set and this is my favorite piece from the set.
I had the longer version of these tongs, and used them so often that I needed another pair.
I use them nearly every day; they are easy to use and do what I want them to.
I highly recommend these if you're looking for longer tongs.
Not at all expensive but work great for cooking almost everything.
I highly recommend these if you're looking for a pair of tongs.
I am a big fan of OXO and was not disappointed in these tongs.
They feel hefty in your hand and are easy to lock closed and unlock when they're needed.
I'm sure I'll get years and years worth of use out of these.
They are easy to use and are easy to open when you only have one hand.
They are accurate to pick up small pieces.
These are a bit longer than my old ones which works well on the grill.
They are great for picking up and moving around hot food.
I use them all the time for grilling out and they never get too hot to hold.
After three years, they still show no signs of wear or rust.Recommended: Yes.
They really grab on and hold.We also got the teflon coated ones for salads and more 'fragile' foods.Nice to have both.
Everything good except it is hard to thoroughly clean all the inside groove and nooks.
The lock works good and  smoothly ,seems durable.
Will buy again but it might be a long time before it needs replacing.
Tongs are the workhorse of a kitchen, and these are an exceptionally good version.
They are stainless steel, have rubber grips, and are a good length.The ability to lock when the hook is pulled is a good one.
The auto-locking type are always locking when I don't want them to.
The jaws spread larger than with smaller tongs, which allows grabbing larger items.
It also gives you some reach, which is important when using them on something in the middle of a hot pan.
I have a longer version for the grill, I wanted another one for kitchen use for pan seared steaks and pork chops.
They are the perfect size and easy to wash.
I used to be a cook many moons ago, and was looking for some tongs that were of the same quality as commercial quality tongs.
I find this size is perfect for all around tong needs.
I bought these, believe it or not, because I have trouble reaching the bottom of my new washing machine.
I purchased one of these over ten years ago, and it still looks brand new.
The rubber keeps it cool, and keeps it from ever getting slippery when wet.
You can get a great grip on just about anything.
The only con with this length is storing it.At thanksgiving I was helping out my mother prepare dinner.
I didn't realize how wonderful the OXO Tongs were until I tried using hers.
(I told her if she wanted my help in the kitchen, she needed these!)My mother is quite the cook.
They have outlasted most of my kitchenaid ones.
Very hard to find in stores at this length.
We had a cheapknock off pair of these originally and the OXOs are made of much heaviergauge stainless steel.
I'm sure everyone else has already reviewed the details of this product so let me instead assure you that these LAST.
I even "misuse" them by pulling them closed with my teeth if my other hand is occupied and have had no issues.
What more is there to be said?  Well done Oxo!.
Oxo makes the best kitchen and barbeque tools and these are no exception.
They are very sturdy and grip tightly, even on large cuts of meat.
OXO makes wonderful products, they are ergonomic so they aren't hard to use.
The rubber handles keeps you from burning your hands when you accidently leave them in a hot skillet or on a hot stove.
They also lock, which is a nice feature for when you want to put them away.
You can sautee with these, use them while tossing pasta or salad, or when you need to move a hot lid.
I can't say enough nice things about these tongs, I use mine every day.
We have the 9 inch and 12 inch; love them both.
Accidentally bought the 9 inch originally with silicone at the grasping portion; it could not pick up much.
These tongs are cleverly designed and solidly built, with a good, sturdy spring, a convenient locking mechanism and comfortable, stay-cool rubber handles.
They are great for barbecues, stir fry, salad and more.
Very convenient.The 12-inch is the best size for all-around use.
They have not shown any rust spots yet, keeping in mind I hand-wash immediately and let drip dry.
They are easily handled, and appropriate weight and the locking mechanism is great for when you only have one hand available.
I use them whenever I BBQ or grill.
couldn't find anything like this at the store so i am glad i found it online.
An ex took these when he moved out and I'm just getting around to replacing them.
Glad I did - I've used them at least every other day since receiving them.
We grill frequently and this product is used often and I haven't had any problems.
Keep in mind that they are long so storing them might be a problem.
OXO makes good gear and this set of tongs is both comfortable and built well.
I have used these types of tongs for years, and the plastic handle is a nice addition.
So is the locking tab that keeps them closed for storage.
The smart additions make this gadget even more convenient to use.
I have tried many other types of tongs, and these are by far my favorite.
Easy to clean, compact for drawer space, and EASY to use!  Light weight and far less complicated than traditional scissor style tongs.
Every cook, beginner to Chef, should have these!  Great as part of a gift basket for newlyweds or new home owners too!.
I cook a lot (not trained) and use tongs a lot.
It is very maddening when you cannot grab something hot in the pan.
These tongs are just the right size:  not too long, substantial but not too much so and can grab anything.
oxo tongs, good quality for a china product.
grip feels good in hand and works smoothly as i expected from a cooks country rating.
I like the lock that holds the tongs together, never had this before.
Good tongs and although I probably should not they wash well in the dishwasher.
I've owned a pair of tongs like this for many years, and finally had to replace them.
I was happy to see they are still being made.
I really like how easy they are to unlock.
I received these as a bridal shower gift and I love them.
They are the perfect size and weight and seem very strong and durable.
Stains do not set on these and I love the rubbery grip on them.
A great value, you will use these forever without having to replace them.
Unlike collared tongs, the Oxo locking mechanism will not accidentally engage while tongs are in use.
Rubber handle inserts give these a solid feel that provides confidence when you're using them.
They are designed with consumer comfort and ergonomics in mind.
They are usually very well made and solid items as well.These tongs are no exception.
The are large enough to give you good reach and distance from oil splatter.
They are absolutely invaluable in cooking, as an extension of your hand to move food items around in pots and pans without burning yourself.
It's so easy to use these to grab steak and flip em, MUCH easier than trying to flip with a fork, spatula, or other devices.
That's because this tool can actually grab and pick up food.
The entire thing is easy to wash and clean.
Some kind of rubber/silicone/non-stick tip would be my next set of tongs.
The stainless steel tips have good grip, so I wouldn't want to sacrifice that.
So I think having one of each would be perfect.
I've got several sets of these - a few in each kitchen, camping gear, etc.
I bought them for my husband, as I read about them on some blog about a man's kitchen or masculine cooking utensils.
He looks 4 inches taller when using them.
The tab at the top locks them in a mostly closed position.
making them less obnoxious to store than similar products.
I needed some extra long tongs for working in a soup pot without getting burned.
I got these cause I already own some OXO stuff.
In case you're wondering, Better Half prefers the tongs to the salad tongs!.
No complaints with the actual clips - everything is well designed.
They are strong, durable, and easy to use (as most OXO stuff is) but.
Holds well and sticks to metal great value.
You can use them for chip bags, notes on the fridge, or just about anything else you may need a clip for.
I like the heavy plastic because cheaper versions tend to break it there is too much tension.
These work really nicely for clamping bags of chips shut tightly.
The magnets are convenient as these clamps stick right on the chalkboard door of my pantry.
The tips that actually grip the bag are rubber coated.
It's higher quality than it needs to be but I find that satisfying and typical of OXO products.
We recently ordered and received another batch of these high-performance clips from Oxo.
We already had a set from years back.
I came to write a review and started scanning reviews and was startled at how many less-than-fair star ratings are accumulating and read them.
DON'T be concerned about purchasing these clips, just look forward to receiving them.
for toddlers.I'm not for binder clips in the kitchen).
If there were a higher rating than five-stars I would give the highest rating possible to this product.
I just don't like to see product ratings that are low due to unrelated issues of the product.
Good clips - not the cheapie kind you get at the dollar store.
These are well made and sturdy with a great grip.
Use them to close bags and hold messages.
The little magnet keeps them attached to any metal surface.
Those other so called bag clips crack and fall apart.
We use them for anything and have had them in the fridge and freezer.
They keep a nice tight seal and do not break in the freezer.
Much better then the junk ones we bought before these.
Well made, stylish, good looking clips with magnets.
You could feel that they are a little expensive if you are willing to shop around in a $ store.
A good filler item to get free shipping ;-).
You can stick them on the frig to hold things or use to close bags.
They are definitely a good item to buy!.
Yes, they are handy to have in the kitchen, they stick to a refrigerator and the side of a stove.
I use them to grab all sorts of items I need to keep handy when I am testing antique recipes.
oven mitts, notes, recipe cards, small bags of spices.
And then there are the general uses, the logical ones that come to mind...closing bags of chips and crackers.
I love that they stick to the fridge so I am always able to find them.
The colors are great, but it would be nice if more colors were available.
Before I bought these clips I used generic blue clippers that were given to me as a promotion for AARP.
I didn't know there was a commercial product I could buy to close bags and anything else I needed closed.
Well I saw these at the supermarket and bought them to see if they worked.
I am buying five sets today from Amazon for less than the supermarket charges and their in pretty colors to boot.
The ones I bought previously were only in white.
These work so well to close bags within their boxes like cracker and cereal bags.
I am giving a set to each of my daughters and daughter in laws.
Oxo has a winner with these.Small and convenient.
There is a size or two up that I like the best from Oxo however.
These work well for small bags and notes stuck to the fridge.
The only beef I have with them is that the magnet strength is too weak.
Bump this while walking past your fridge and they'll fall to the floor.Otherwise, a good overall clip.
They are also washable, so greasy kitchen finger prints are not a problem.
I agree with reviewer Jill, this is one of the most functional gadgets in my kitchen.
I have 2 sets, one black &amp; one white, and I just ordered a 3rd set in multicolor.
They're great for all kinds of food bags: coffee, cat food, cereal, pasta, rice, anything that comes in a bag.
I have one on my front door to hold notes or letters to be mailed.
I have one on my refrigerator for notes &amp; grocery lists.
I use them in my home office as giant paperclips to hold stacks of papers.
I use them in the bathroom on bags of cotton balls &amp; other supplies.
There seems to be no end to the uses!.
These clips are excellent - brightly colored, high quality, and they grip onto anything.
They won't change your life, but they're extremely handy.
They last, and they maintain a tight grip rather than losing their &quot;spring&quot; after repeated use.
The bright colors are also attractive, and the fact that they double as refrigerator magnets is a nice twist.
I received these clips as a stocking stuffer.
What a great IDEA and a great GIFT.
They are more durable then the wide plastic clips I have used in the past.
They are in bright fun colors and the design is attractive.
BONUS!  These clips are easy to find, they have attached magnents allowing them to store right on my fridge!.
These are not real strong in my opinion.
i love the colors and they work well for light weight items and small bags!.
I have a kitchen full of OXO and I am still buying more.
I love these colorful bag clips as they are also have magnets to keep them handy.
I just love these things!  I have had this set for about 4 years and not one has broken.
Only one has broken and since they stick to the fridge I have not even lost one of the clips.
Like the 3 bears, I love a bowl of porridge in the morning.
Second only to weevil infestation is staleness, and odour from other products stored in the same cupboard as the oats.
These Clips keep my oats fresh and tasty.
Incredible, but not surprising, considering the robust nature of these wonderful OXO Bag Clips.
I've stopped using those chip clips which slide off, and you also have to fiddle with them to get them on.
At this price, you can afford to try the clips out.
If you need bag clips, and who doesn't, these are for you.
The magnetic base allows you to store them on the fridge and the heavy spring should last a long while.
I have a few "chip bag type clips" and they really are not as good as these new Oxo Good Grips clips.
They don't slip off like those "other" bag clips.
You know the ones.For bags of chips and everything else.
Also keeps the bags of frozen veggies from spilling in the freezer!~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.
I ordered these again and they look like the top picture not the optional picture.
The magnets are handy, and you can fit a bunch in a small space.
You can get cheaper chip clips, but you truly get what you pay for.
I felt very proud of myself when I found some copy-cat oxo clips at a dollar store.
These are very secure and never bend or get out of shape.
I've bought several packs and have had some of them for years.
I have plenty of room on my fridge for storage.
But not very much in cupboards and drawers.
So some genius came up with the idea of sticking magnets on these babies, and they haven't gotten lost in our house since.
I wish my walls were magnetic and more products could just be stuck on there for storage.
I have had the WORST luck with wire cheese slicers , regardless of  whether they were purchased at the grocery store or gourmet cooking shop.
I actually had a $20.00 slicer fall apart with  its  very first use.
It worked well  on cheddar, monterey jack, colby, colby jack and mozerella.
Since getting my first item from OXO Good Grips (the potato masher), I have become obsessed with this brand.
I intend to replace some of my crappy utensils and end up with mostly items by this brand.
What's that you say?  You're hankerin' for a hunk of cheese?  Well you'll need something to cut it with...that's for sure.
This baby will take care of that for you.
Use the slices to top your famous tuna noodle casserole.
Powdered donuts?  No way!  Burgers?  Now you're talking fun!  Good gracious those grips are good.
I have bought several OXO products in the past.
OXO makes the best products and this slicer is no exception.
"UPDATE" This cheese cutter wire has pulled out of it's pinned hole in the handle.
I was using it on Mozzarella cheese for pizza.
The roller fell out along with the pin that held the wire in place.
Since I bought it  2012 I have used it approx.
I've had one of these for a while now that replaced a P-3, a cheap tin hand cranked one and an old electric countertop model.
I have never had the wheel  &quot;skid&quot; off the rim yet.
I even take this one camping with me.
(Gotta open those beans; remember blazing saddles?)Oxo really has built  the better mouse trap.
I have been searching for a good can opener for years now.
It's amazing how many subpar can openers there are out there.
Part of the problem is that I have arthritis.
While most everyday tasks don't give me trouble, using a can opener does.
I see that others have had the locking mechanism break, I really hope I get lucky with mine.
This is a very well designed can opener that makes a big difference in the kitchen for me.
This is probably the best can opener I've ever had - and I've tried many.
I like the lock and the turn mechanism on the side.
The oxo good grips locking can opener is just amazing.
It never walks off the can...has an easy grip, and the locking mechanism is easy to set and free.
I buy these by the dozen to give to friends.
Much better than any manual OR electric can opener!.
It is perfect and if it every goes out on me I will purchase another one just like it.
I hate using electric can openers, because I have limited counter space.
I'm at a loss to understand the negative reviews of this product here on Amazon.
I've had one for two or three years now, and I think it's one of the best kitchen tools I ever bought.
And the locking mechanism means I don't have to keep squeezing while I turn the easily-grasped turning knob.This thing is well-designed and well-constructed.
It cuts smoothly and holds the can securely.
This is a well made and very useful tool!.
This can opener has been terrific!  It is easy to place on the can and turns very easily.
I was a bit skeptical about this can opener, but I am glad I made the investment.
It was time to get a new can opener and I bought the right one.This is the first manual can opener I have ever liked.
I can just put it on the can, squeeze, turn and unlock when the can is open.
Other manual can openers I have used seem to need precision when placing them on the can, but not this one.
I like the fact that it locks and I don't have to keep squeezing.
I would recommend this one especially for anyone who needs a can opener that is easy and simple to use.
We have an older model at home and use almost daily.
We went through several other brands at the cabin before finding this one.
We had already thrown several others in the trash.
Great can opener for easy handling and operation.
I live in a rural area and use A LOT of canned goods.
I had bought this same one about 12 years ago and the twisty handle finally broke off.
I had to buy the same exact one becasue I love how easy it makes opening a can.
I would recomend this can opener to all.
We have tried can openers from every manufacturer, this is the only one tht totally works with no hassel.
Sometimes the stress of choosing the perfect gift is just too much.
So whether Valentine's Day is looming /OR/ a  "significant"  birthday.
perhaps you should go with Solomon and choose both?For under $25.
you can leave the choice to your beloved: either a Black OXO, or a Black SWING-AWAY.
Yours will be a happier household and that counts for plenty on these special occasion days that pop up all too often.
I bought this for my daughter's birthday, because she had been laughing about breaking so many dollar store can openers.
She likes it, and says it works about as well as my Pampered Chef clean edge can opener.
I prefer this design because you don't end up with sharp edges on your can lids, thus reducing the chances of cut fingers.
I've had my Oxo Good Grips Locking Can Opener for years, and am just now looking at purchasing a second one.
I still get a can opened eventually, but I've been spoiled with an opener that used to work flawlessly.
We used this can opener at my cousin's house, and ordered one as soon as we got home.
My wife uses it, primarily, to open pet food cans for our dogs and cat.
We have tried electric and mechanical can openers, none of which worked very well.
It opens any can we've tried it on without missing a beat.
This can opener is still going strong in 2011.
This product is definitely worth the purchase price.
Using it this week since i purchased it, I keep thinking that I should have bought this long ago.
I have had this can opener for at least a year now and my lock is still intact.
However after a year of frequent use I am now finding that the gears that actually latch onto the can are slipping off.
All I can say about the loch is be gentle it is only plastic.
Works well and does not require the hand strength of a giant to get the job done--what more need be said?.
This opener is really easy to use and it works very well.
I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 since I don't know how long it will last.
(I've had really bad luck buying can openers lately--one refused to work when I brought it home from the store.).
For the persons who bought and reviewed this procudt badly 10 YEARS ago, would u like to buy and try again.
:c)  I have to use these every time I make something.
They are constantly being washed, either in the sink or dishwasher.
I have really abused these things at times.
I like the plastic construction which does not give my  ingredients a metallic taste like conventional aluminum cups can.
These  clean up easy and the handles are coated allowing for an easy and secure  grip even when your hands are wet.
These tools are either a baker or a person who cannot bake...very easy to be used.
I have to admit that I purchased these cups to bump up an order ...so I could receive free shipping.
I was looking for something cheap to fill the order.
I hadn't thought about replacing my old cups before.
However, I'm glad to have these measuring cups, as they are very durable and well made.
I like the color coded measurements on the handle.
Over the last few years we have taken to drinking a bottle of wine with dinner nearly every day.
We have almost every type of corkscrew made, from the big, bulky Houdini to the super simple waiters' model.
We even got an electric one as a gift.
The Oxo one is a butterfly model, designed to make opening wine bottles idiot-proof.
It's almost there - we found it easy to use.
And if your hands are wet a lot, or slightly arthritic, I can see how this may be a great choice.
Nothing terrible, but definitely one of the slower ways to open a bottle.
If you're a lush like us, your best bet is on of the articulated waiter's models.
Once mastered, those will open a bottle as fast as a houdini, without all the bulk.
However, if you're an occasional drinker, or want to get something for an older person, the Oxo is an excellent choice.
It's ideal for anyone seeking their first corkscrew or a spare, say, for the picnic kit.
The product I received has a cut-out window so you can see the cork coming out.
The wings are also slightly smaller and do not wrap all the way around as pictured.
I have uploaded an alternate picture for reference.
Credit due, as one of John LeCarre's characters quips in "The  Russia House", to the winged corkscrew.
And chief among the  convenient and effortless gadgets I have been given to speed me on my way  is this terrific little winged corkscrew.
The metal screw has a slick coating of something like Teflon that reduces friction as it goes in and is  removed from the cork.
What else can I say, this opens a bottle of wine with ease, and seems well made.
This is truly like cutting thru hot butter.
Even if you haven't cut off the foil top, this one pulls the cork out easily, releases easy, and is THE BEST.
The first time that I used this corkscrew I thought it was going to break but so far it has held up well.
Since it is made of plastic I was hesitant to apply too much pressure but it is tougher than it looks.
I like the Teflon coating on the screw and the fact that it's dishwasher safe.
This corkscrew gets the job done and is priced very well.
You push the screw through the cork exactly /once/ and the whole entire thing pops out in one feel swoop.
Unlike other corkscrews, you don't need to repeatedly screw the thing into the cork to pull out the cork.
If you have trouble with corks, this is your new BFF.
Once it's firmly embedded you grasp the wing-like handles and push them down.
It's a nifty-looking design that makes opening bottles very easy on my hands despite my tendonitis.
Thus far this corkscrew has been one of my better acquisitions, no more corks shredding or ending up floating in my bottle of wine.
I like that, but the jury is out as of yet to see how long the plastic parts hold up.
I'm a big fan of most OXO products.
This wine opener is not as slick as most OXO products I have.
My other wine opener has much less plastic and has been very durable (had for several years).
I prefer my other corkscrew I bought on Amazon for around same price.h.
The OXO makes opening a bottle of wine or oil effortless.
I try not to be "that guy" but when your corkscrew looks this good it is hard not to demonstrate.
I read a few negative reviews about this corkscrew that are critical of the build quality.
I'm not sure exactly what type of polymer it's made of, but it's not "cheap plastic".
Yes, it's very lightweight and made of something not metal, but whatever it's made of is very strong and durable.
I like OXO products, and this easy-to-use corkscrew is no exception to that rule.
The matte-black plastic is on the plain side, and could use the aesthetics of the OXO Steel lineup.
Time will tell if the plastic body holds up to regular use, I'll update if the corkscrew breaks.
So while it won't fit in my pocket, it is Recommended.
This is a very good winged corkscrew  quite easy to use.
This is probably just as sturdy as anything else that is out there these days.
The plastic does seem a bit flimsy to an old person like me because I remember when all plastics were  flimsy.
I am Arthritic but had  no trouble a tall using it.
It's affordably priced, is very effective at removing corks, and...dare I say...even a little bit fun to use.
I haven't used this one, but it seems to have pretty good reviews.
The Oxo Good Grips Winged Corkscrew is, indeed, easy to use.
The nonstick coating on the screw makes it easy to slide into the cork and the knob is wide and easy to grasp.
I can only suggest that buyers retain their sales receipt in case of breakage, since Oxo does offer replacement or refund.
So far we've had no need of that.
I'll admit it - I own the $200 Leverpull because it's prettydoggone cool.
Very, very pleased with the ease at how this works.
The results are better than I initially imagined.
Most of the time my wife and I use the bowl as our server, just add some dressing and we're ready to go.
wow this is a truly amazing salad spinner.
it keeps washed leaves fresh & crisp for a long time (5 days is the longest ive tried before eating them).
usually, we would try different ways of washing & storing lettuce but even after 2 days it would get soggy & brownish.
this makes eating salad into an easy meal.
so this has totally increased the salad consumption in our household (& we are mostly vegetarian!).
now its fun to try making new dressings each time.oh yeah, before i forget, slice avocado in your salad!.
Years, and years ago my Daddy who was a fantastic gardener gave me a fantastic salad spinner, but after many, many spins it gave out.
I bought at least three spinners after that--all went to the dump.
I expect to have this spinner working for me the rest of my life.
Salad spinners are great at getting most of the moisture off freshly washed greens.
I kept the outside plastic bowl from my older spinner because it's still in very good shape and is useful as a salad bowl.
I got tired of purchasing the already shredded/cut romaine for salads.
So decided to go the way of getting the better priced lettuce and do it myself.
Well, I am not a real kitchen person so whatever I purchased was going to have to be easy and simple.
Easy to work and boy does it work.
So I can now keep rinsing and spinning until the lettuce rinses clean and clear.
My only problem is the difficulty I have in cleaning the insert of lettuce "bits"of lettuce.
Holding them under the faucet doesn't remove all of them as they get caught in between the lattice work of the spin bowl.
But that being said, it should not really affect your decision.
So much better to work a little getting bits out now and then, then to get e.
Perhaps even putting the pre cut lettuce into this thing, wash and spin is a great idea to.
Usually when traveling It is a pain to deal with  lettuce and salads, so we purchased ready made salads or went out to eat.
Getting a head of lettuce on the road and using this smaller version of this should do the trick!.
Had a cheap salad dryer for years, but was always bothered by the chemicals in the plastic.
This brand makes their products safely, so I decided to switch.
It is an excellent design and does the job!.
This salad spinner is durable and easy to use.
It has a lock so you can keep the pump portion down for storing, which is a nice feature.
The cleaning of it is simple and it works really well for my salad drying needs.
Pros: Dries my salad greens and vegetables through the magic of centrifugal force.Cons: Doesn't spin fast enough for uranium enrichment.
I am the author of a series of cookbooks and have used this OXO spinner -- after using many others -- for about three years.
It gets daily use and has never failed us.
It's easy to clean and store and it really gets the moisture off the lettuce and other vegetables like beans, carrots and so on.
I highly recommend this product for anyone who's serious about making great salads.
It is much sturdier than the ones I've used in the past.
It spins well and really gets the water off.
I like that the handle collapses so I can use this as the lid in the refrigerator.
The OXO Good Grips does a really good job at drying my fruits and vegetables.
The only complaint I have is that I would like to get it started and let it spin while I do something else.
It isn't a delicately balanced "machine;" it will rock and walk if left alone.
For the price, I'm not complaining - it is a great spinner.
This is the third salad spinner my wife and I have purchased.
The other 2 worked great out of the box, but soon they both stopped working.
This OXO spinner was noticably different the first time we used it.
Inner bowl lifted out easily and we drained the water.
Spun again to try to get it as dry as possible and it got a little more, but not too much was left.
We drained the bowl of water, then tossed the salad into the main bowl to use as out serving bowl.
We like to make a lot of salad so we had leftovers.
Just to test it, we left the salad (romaine and radicchio)in the bowl with the lid on and put it in the fridge.
I was still nice and crisp 4 days later when we decided to just eat it.
So far so good with this spinner, but if any problems come up I will update.
The color brightens up our kitchen, and it's fun to use.
Very easy to use with the push vs cranking spinner.
I also like that it has a &#34;brake&#34;.
I could not be happier with this product!! I use it daily for all sorts of greens, cut up veggies and herbs.
It works like a charm! Its smooth and really gets most of the water off the produce! I highly recommend this product!.
I read several reviews on which one to go with and decided to give this one a try.
Buy this one it is excellent and I love it.
I bought this as a gift for someone - and I'm a bit envious as I have the original white one.
This one is gorgeous!  I love this salad spinner because it works.
The pull-string type reverse direction with each pull of the cord and you can never get up to a sufficient speed.
This newer model also has a snap out lid liner for easy rinsing.
My ancient salad spinner finally gave out, so I decided it was time to upgrade.
So glad I did, the push button is way easier than the crank handle thing I use to have.
So, I'll try the green and hope the color doesn't change noticeably!.
We had the previous incarnation of this salad spinner with the more rounded bowl, and it finally gave out after years of faithful service.
Well, it's not flimsy at all, in fact it's sturdier than the old basket, just has a transparent quality.
So far it's working fine, but given the warnings about the mechanism, I'm just being careful not to really pound on it.
The plastic bowl is an attractive shape, and until it gets beat up, would actually be a really serving bowl for a salad.
I like the pump instead of a crank handle which can be awkward.
This item really does the job it dries the salad items so that the dressing sticks and does not become watery.
Its mechanism is simple, and holds up well.
And now with this green color, all the people with boring white will be jealous.
(These devices are to dry freshly washed lettuce in case you've always wondered about there purpose...).
doesn't get up to super speed, but does the job and has alot of capacity.
I use it on store bought pre-made salads.
Very stable  - this is the key selling point of this over other designs with smaller bases which wobble when spun.
Like the lock down top which saves valuable storage space.
Bought it as it was recommended by America's test kitchen as the best one on the market.
Cool gadget, but kind of a luxury item for a cook who already has it all.
It takes up lots of cabinet space, but you could use the bowl as a mixing bowl too.
Very easy to use, gets the job done quickly.
Does take up a little room to store (I'm always short on cabinet space) but at least it looks great sittin' on the counter!.
I have always liked salads but never liked preparing them.
No matter how much I dried the greens and veggies it always seemed like I ended up with a soggy salad and water downed dressing.
This is not the case any longer!This salad spinner works wonders.
I place the lettuce and chopped veggies right into the removable strainer section of the spinner and rinse under cold water.
I then place the strainer back into the spinner, place the top on and give it a couple of spins.
A few minutes later I have a perfectly dry salad ready to eat!The spinner is well constructed and feels solid.
The bowl doesn't move around the counter at all while it is spinning so you do not need to sit there and hold it still.
I also like the bowl under it, I rinse the veggies in the bowl and then dump them in the basket to spin.
All you have to do is pump the black knob and it spins all the water out.
I love that it is so easy to use!.
Bought this as a birthday present and the recipient said she loves it.
Gave it 5 stars because I have not heard anything bad about it from her.
At this time, I have not used my new &#34;OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner&#34;.
This is a perfect size for a few salads.
It holds more than I thought it would.
It is very efficient at getting the water out of the greens.
It is also nice and small to store.
I bought this while on a health kick, thinking it would make me eat more salad, and because I needed a crisper.
I use it occasionally, but I found cleaning it to be difficult.
I would recommend the smaller version, unless you have an extra large family.
I also don't find it to be a very good crisper--my lettuce lasts two days.
Why did I wait so long to get one of these?  It's one of my favorite pieces of equipment and I use it a lot.
Yes, this product does it's jb very well.
This is the first one I ever used, and really like it.
Although it is plastic, it seems very durable.
This salad spinner is the perfect size for 2 people.
It's easy to use, and the button can stay down to store it in tighter spaces.
All the pieces are lightweight and easy to clean.
I have been using this spinner for about 6 mos at least once a week.
I had a smaller spinner that would not hold a head of romaine lettuce.
A spinner any smaller than the OXO would not hold a head of romaine or green leaf lettuce.
My son the resident dishwasher that has broken lots of stuff has not broken this yet so I would have to say its pretty durable.
The 4-year old can operate it without it spinning off the counter.
It can process a lot of greens at one time.
Not all salad spinners are created alike, but this is up there with the best.
I love it!  Going to be buying several more for gifts.I've had this for about 6 months now.
We love salad and have been using our OXO salad spinner for over 4 years.
We have dropped the bowl several times and the various nicks and scratches have not been fatal to overall performance.It does its job well.
We love buying a fresh head of romaine to cut up and spin for our salad.
It seems so much more economical and tasty than the pre-packaged lettuce.We also find that the strainer acts as a handy colander in a pinch.
Does exactly what it is made to do and does it well, spins enough salad for 4 people at a time.
I didn't buy one for 2 years wondering if its something that would just sit and never be used now its used often.
This was also rated by Americas Test Kitchen 2012 as the best salad spinner.
Purchased this as a gift and they state the spinner works very well.
This is our second spinner of this type.
There are spinners out there that boast of washing and drying.
This kitchen gadget nut is also a clean freak.
I'll wash my veggies and berries by hand, thank you very much.
Then I use my trusty Oxo spinner to finish the job.
It is the best DRYER on the market, and I have used a lot of them.
The spinner continues on its axis long after the last pump.
There is a brake button to stop the action if you wish.
The large clear bowl seconds as a salad bowl, and when you are through you lock the pump down out of sight for better storage.
I had an old spinner that was large and had a pull cord that was cumbersome to use and clean.
It takes up less space and is still large enough for washing greens for a salad for my husband and I.
It gets the greens or lettuce dryer, too, and it stays stable on the counter while it's spinning.
I find it much easier to push the plunger than pull a cord.
Having used several different types of salad spinners over the years, I have to say that this is the best one yet.
Just push the plunger and let it spin away.
You can do other things while it works, as you don't have to hang on to it.
I saw this one at my sister's house.
Bought it here and it came right to my door within a couple of days.
I saw it at my local Target store for the same price.
So, if you don't want to drive to your local Target store.
Buy it here, it costs the same and you save time.
Saw this recommended on the sprout house website.
Compact and just the right size for sprouts of all kinds and of course smaller amounts of lettuce.
It's a workhorse that never fails to spin.
It's amazing that somebody finally did sell something what does exactly that it was advertised to do.
I've had other salad spinners and this one is far better.
Very easy to use and effective, the brake is a great feature.
I like mine so much I purchased one for my mother as well.
I just bought this item to replace a 8-year old Zyliss spinner b/c I couldn't separate the lid for cleaning.
I knew the OXO was a great product since I already had the smaller one which I use for blueberries, cherries, herbs, etc.
But, this large OXO is heavier than my Zyliss and it's difficult for this senior woman with slight arthritis to handle.
I used to "one hand" the Zyliss (even full), but I have to use both hands to carry the OXO empty.
If it was lighter, I'd give it 5 stars.
I got this as a gift for my Mom she is pretty health conscious and thought this would be a good gift for her.
She loves it and uses it quite a bit.
Believe it or not, this is my first salad spinner.
I've run about 4 heads of various types of greens through it so far.
I usually wash and tear the greens by hand, then use the spinner to dry.
Depending on how much water I've used, they are usually dry in one or two spins.
I drain the excess water from the bowl, replace the basket with the greens still inside, then continuing making my salad directly in the basket.
Any leftovers stay in the basket and are stored in the fridge.
The salads appear to stay fresher longer this way than if I had stored them in a bowl.
Like what some other reviewers have mentioned, this spinner does not dry the greens.
I use this spinner to get that water off and it does the trick.
I had an older salad spinner that had the horrible pull string on it.
I decided to try this one since OXO has never let me down.
In the summer, I grow lots of lettuce in my garden.
This spinnermakes it easier to clean and prepare salads everyday.Easy to use and clean.
One of the things I love most about Oxo is that it's not a company to rest on its laurels.
Even when they have a perfectly great product on the market, they look for ways to make it even better.
This is good for both washing veggies as well as drying them.
Safe, easy and fun for kids to help out with in the kitchen.
I find the large size useful for getting the water out of small laundry items too.Doesn't have the stupid string to break.
I have used this salad spinner for about 5 years and really like it.
I recently purchased one for my sister as she was complaining about the cheap one she has.
It works better than any others I have used, but like all of them can be a bit difficult to clean.
I just rinse it thoroughly right after use so that nothing dries inside it.
Good spinner but like so many of them, once it gets spinning it can move around a bit on a counter.
You have to hold it still or put on a dish towel.
I like that you can easily take the lid apart in one motion to wash the inside of the lid.
I am not a fan of the brake button as I believe it causes the plastic to wear and eventually get into your salad.
I just spin it and let it stop on it's own.Overall, it's just what I expected.
My last one wore out after several years.
This one seems to have been improved since the last one so I am mostly happy with it.
OXO makes solid products and nothing lasts forever.
What can I say that has not already been said.
I purchased the Mini because I have limited cabinet space and usually am cooking for 2 or less.
This thing is amazing, works like a charm.
I only wish that you could by additional strainers so I could use as temporary storage while I am spinning something else.
I'm really glad I opted for the Mini and will likely buy a second one.
The size is perfect and holds more than what you'd probably anticipate from the picture.
Amazon offers a great priced compared to other retailers on this (unless you get a 30% coupon at Kohls).
very satisfied with this product; easy to use and really gets moisture out of leafy vegetables.
I was resisting getting a Salad Spinner for a while (never saw the point).
Caved in and finally got one, and I really am impressed with how fast it dries the lettuce/spinach/etc.
(vs the papertowel method I was using before).
I love how this one works as a storage and an attractive serving bowl as well.
I washed and spun 2 heads of lettus in no time flat with this gizmo.
I love that the pump mechanism can be stored locked down and the little black braking button is a really nice touch.
This is a great kitchen item to have, it really gets out the extra water and allows your favorite dressing to cling to the salad.
I do enjoy salads, but I don't enjoy all the prep work cleaning the greens for the salads.
I can't believe how simple it is to use.
Rinse greens, put in spinner, pump the handle a few times and then hit the button.
When you take off the lid, you have clean and 'just moist' greens.
Let's face it, organic spinach is filthy!  It is usually splattered with mud and grit.
So in the past, it took several rinsings in a colander before the water ran clear.
Now, I have clean, organic greens in about 45 seconds.
And given the design, the greens are not in contact with the dirty water.
now all you have to do is dress the salad.Oh, the size of the clear bowl makes a great serving bowl for parties.
I prepare a salad, put the lid on, depress the pump, lock it into place, and then set the whole container in the refrigerator.
Then, when guests arrive, I can take it out from the 'frige, remove the lid, and have enough salad to feed a small army.
Though with clean, no-soggy greens, who's gonna have leftovers?.
I had a previous Oxo salad spinner, and after 10+years, it finally gave up the ghost.
So I got a new one.This one is better than my previous one.
It is more secure when in use, and it is much easier to clean.
Better than others I have tried, as the spinning motion is imparted by pushing down on the spinner,which helps keep it in place.
Really like this salad spinner; it is really easy to use.
It definitely does a good job when it comes to draining the water off of the salad greens!.
I received this as a gift and was initially tempted to return it based on past poor experiences with salad spinners.
Very glad that I kept it -- it works well and is very easy to use.
With the salad spinner, the plunger can be locked in the down position to make it easier to store.
It's a lot easier to push down on a plunger than grasp a knob or pull a string.Highly recommend!.
I bought this one as a wedding shower gift but I have the same model that I have used for years.
It holds up nicely and you can put it in the dishwasher.
It can be used for more than just lettuce too.
Makes my life so easy! I often buy red or green leaf lettuce instead of bagges lettuce and this works so well after washing.
No more wet salads or trying to dry off veggies with paper towels.
the brake is genius, and the handle will lock down flat if you need to save space.
Aggravated for the last time, I was very happy to see this come on a gold box offer.
It's small for a larger leaf lettuce such as romaine, but I tore it up in smaller pieces and away it went.
I love the mini version of this salad spinner.
It holds enough greens for a couple of dinner salads, works very well, and it's easy to store because of the smaller size.
Mine has been going strong for a couple of years.
I love it for washing and drying herbs from the garden in the summer.
By luck, I encountered this larger sized Oxo Good Grips Salad Spinner.
After trying the Oxo's efficient, easy to use push-down plunger, and its no-wobble action, I was sold on the spot.
The 20th Century Zyliss went into the Goodwill box.
Now I use this 21st Century, much improved Oxo salad spinner.
It takes just a few seconds to do this.
The nearly vertical bowl saves space when storing...I like that.
It is easy to clean and easy to use.
From what I have read, Oxo is famed for its readiness to refund your money, or replace items, if you are not totally satisfied.
If you have questions, please reply in the Comment section below...I would be glad to help.________________________________________________________________________________________________________________MY NEW BLOG: thegoodstuffreviews.blogspot.com.
love the wider base and straighter sloped sides.
much more stable on the counter to pump up reaching G force speeds.
This is my first spinner and so far, so good.
It works well for its purpose so I have no problems.
Very easy to assemble and take care of.
It gets all the water off after washing it and I found it is very easy to clean after each use.
Easy to use, easy to clean, removes a lot of water.
Easy to use, easy to clean and it works fast.
I have always washed my salad greens and shook them out in a dishcloth--this works fine but the salad spinner is definitely a convenience tool.
Depending on the type of lettuce, it generally needs about 3 spins.
I empty the water left in the bowl after spinning, but I think leaving the water on the bottom might keep the salad crisper.
I don't think it really makes a difference.
It keeps for days and I just re-rinse and re-spin when I need more.
The lettuce is kept perfectly crisp and fresh.
I thought it might be too big for 2 people, but it isn't.
I am sure the smaller one would work just as well and I may get that for herbs or veggies.
A very handy tool, and not a gimmick.
I take the interior basket outside to put them in, then wash them.
Oxo makes great products (I have many), and I especially I love my Oxo Good Grips Salad Spinner.
I've had it for six years now and use it all the time.What I like about it is, well, everything.
Just used it for the first time and was very happy about how well it dried my lettuce.
I have had a spinner before, but with a crank, but this is so much better.
This sure beats using a towel as I had been doing!Also, the brake works well, and the top comes apart for a thorough cleaning.
And I'm glad I bought the larger size.
We love the fast pumping action and the quick brake stop feature.
Definitely on the top shelf of things you need to keep handy in the pantry.
This item works really well for spinning lettuce and spinach leaves for salads.
GREAT SALAD SPINNER!  I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MANUALLY SPIN IT...JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND IT DOES ALL THE WORK.
IT ALSO HAS A VERY NICE CLEAN LOOK.
I assumed you were paying for the oxo name with this product, but a year+ on it has been the best spinner I have had.
It works well, has a nice stopping feature and is easier to spin than other models I have used.
I especially like that it can be disassembled to allow for the components to try out (less bacteria buildup).
I have the mini version of this salad spinner.
I would not actually use the term "mini" to describe it, since it does hold a lot of lettuce.
I just rinse it off when done (easy for quick weeknight dinners).
I like the operation of this product (push down) better than the large Zyliss spinner that I own that has a pull-string.
The small Oxo spinner is also great for drying blueberries.
Works great with salad and larger items such as: fruits and vegetables.
I buy quality kitchen tools and cooking equipment.
This product is no different.This product in person is much more substantial and built with quality than one may think from the photos.
In our house, I might do most of the cooking, but my wife is the Salad Queen.
We buy some greens, prep them, spin them, make a salad, and leave the rest in the spinner, in the fridge.
The leftover greens also last much longer than the bagged goods.
I use my OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner every day for the last 20 years or so.
Today, I thought I wonder if someone invented a better salad spinner.
So I checked and this one is still rated #1 and mine still works as good as the day I purchased it.
I guess there is no improving on perfection.
I had read that water on some vegetables while in the refrigerator can speed up thedegrading process.
I knew it was a good idea to wash all vegetables before eating.The solution is a salad spinner.
Since we are on a diet, buying those bags of salad mix is getting expensive.
With this I tear up a head of lettuce and rinse it out and within a minute of spinning, I have clean, dry lettuce.
And it's like a toy top, fun to play with.
The handle recedes to make it less tall to put away.
This is the one Alton Brown recommends in his book "Gear for your Kitchen.".
It is for a large amount of salad, and the bowl doubles as a serving piece, looks great on the table.
It spins the salad very dry, and stores well, the spinner knob, locks down for storage.
This product should be marketed to the Chinese diaspora.
Frankly, everyone in Asia needs to be introduced to this product.
What a good deal this salad spinner is.
You can't beat this jewel!  It's durable, easy to use, easy to clean, and it does a great job.
Like any other salad spinner, hold it steady with your free hand while it is spinning.
nothing to it!  To clean it afterward, I usually just rinse out the bowl and strainer and let them air dry.
But once every few days or so, I might put them in the sink with soapy water for a real wash.
I've only used it a few times so far but it spins well and fast.
It's nice that the pump top collapses down for storage and the brake button is nice too.
My oh My!  This is the thing to have.
Works like a charm at spinning out water on lettuce.
Getting it dry makes it keep longer in the refrig.
Will replace with same product if this one wears out, which will be a long time from now.
Would make a great gift for a new bride.
This spinner does get a lot of water out after you spin it however the lettuce is still moist which I guess is expected.
I thought it would work a lot better.
This salad spinner is so amazingly centered! A single push and it keeps spinning for what feels like minutes.
I am late to the game on salad spinners.
This salad spinner has so many useful features.
The push top locks into place so it takes up less space.
So if yours is defective for any reason, there's no reason for you to be out any money.
The spinner works well, but unlike other spinners I've used, this one has no designated top to cover the salad once it's made.
You either have to find your own, or use the top with the spinning device.
We received this OXO Good Grip 32480 salad spiner just in time because our old one was broken.
This one works very well and it is so easy to operate.
The thickness of the outer bowl is more than adequate and feels like you could drop it without it breaking.
The pump mechanism works very well without the need to press very hard or often.
I decided to purchase the lettuce keeper and the lettuce knife because of the reputation for quality from OXO.
I also own a tea kettle from OXO and really like it for all the same reasons, build quality, design, etc.
If you're in the market for a great salad spinner I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this model.
This is the best salad spinner that I have ever owned.
It is a little pricier than others, but as the saying goes..."You get what you pay for.".
I think I should have a salad tonight but don't because it is so much bother to make.
Saw this do hickey and said "why not try it".
Even when I am real lazy at dinner time I make salads.
You put all your lettuce and veggies in the spinner and run water up to the brim.
I usually add ice and make everything cold and crisp.
Pick up the basket and dump the water and ice in the sink.
Then put the lid on and spin away.
Everything is ready to dump into the salad bowl.
When you spin this gizmo doesn't even walk on you.
I saw a salad spinner used on America's Test Kitchen, checked to see what they recommended, and bought this one.
I've used it a lot and recommend it to all my friends and family who  help me cook when we get together.
Once they use it they are just as impressed as I am.
Perfect for a small family and doesn't hog up all the cupboard space.
This is without a doubt the one of the best, and I've actually tried a few.
I've had mine for four years now and it still WORKS as good as the day I bought it.
Never mind comments about it being too bulky(smaller versions are available).
If you make a lot of salads, this is a must have.
It's sturdy and wrings salad dry within 1-2 spins.
Most importantly, no awlful hand cranks that can brake off.
For this kind of quality,it's worth every penny.
I looked at a lot of salad spinners and tried several models out at Wal-Mart, William-Sonoma et al.
Keep in mind you press down on the top.
Do not pound it, it spins with little pressure.
After it begins to spin, you can add pressure and increase speed.
This way you do not over stress parts.
This is a good product for drying out vegetables.
It takes much less time to spin this than to pat lettuce dry.
I really like the way you can use the spinner without having the bear hug it to hold it down.
No water on the counter is also nice.
Both can be used for other things such as spining the seeds out of tomatoes (yes, you do have to cut them first).
We got this as a gift some time ago for our daughter.
This product has been used a LOT, works superbly well, and has LASTED.
More than we can say for most things we buy now-a-dayz.
It's just like it's bigger brother and works exactly the same.
Easy to use, very effective and great looking.
I've tried the others - string pulled and cranked - and this is simply the best.
This allows the dirt to settle to the bottom.Then we lift the latticework bowl out and pour out the water.
Put it back into the now-empty clear plastic bowl, and top with the funky-looking lid.
Lift off the top, and you're done!The only minor problem is that it's hard to dry everything off.
The top mechanism is enclosed, and it's likely to get at least a little wet inside during the spinning process.
You just have to put it in a rack and wait for it to dry - you can't dry the inside with a towel.
Likewise, it's tough to dry the latticework bowl with a towel because of all those nooks and crannies.
The clean up on this product is incredibly easy and sturdiness of the product is much better than other spinners.
I have owned many salad spinners and they all typically break within a year.
This Oxo spinner has been going strong for over 1.5 years now and it still looks brand new!.
Well-manufactured, excellent design, useful salad spinner has been utilized since I unpacked the box.
Works perfectly every time, has had a lot of use, going on 7 years old, and still performs well.
Cleans up easily, stores easily--and washes/dries the greens thoroughly! Highly recommended!.
I especially liked the suction cups that hold the spinner to the counter top during the spinning process.
I found that lettuce truly does last longer and tastes fresher than the salad mix in a bag that I typically purchased.
I wanted this for so long, but didn't want to find a place in my kitchen to store it.
I always hated washing salad and waiting forever for the leaves to dry enough to put it away.
Plus, I then store the salad in it and it is perfect.
Still a bit costly, but it should last a long, long time.
I saw this product on several of those Food Network cooking shows.
I'm naturally suspiscious of products endorsed by tv hacks because I assume it's a conflict of interest - the manufacturer is probably a paid sponsor.
Well in the case of any of the Oxo products that I've seen on these programs I have to say they SHOULD recommend them HIGHLY.
The Oxo Good Grips Salad Spinner is an absolute winner!  Simply the best salad spinner that I've used.
Like all the Oxo products I've purchased this salad spinner is well made, is easy to use, actually works, and is reasonably priced.
Don't waste your time even looking at any other salad spinners, trust me, you can't do any better than the Oxo Good Grips.
Should wash all veggies from the supermarket, even if the bagged salads say they are pre-washed.
And, the outer bowl becomes your salad bowl.
I haven't used it much yet but so far so good.
It stores well in our fridge which is nice.
It works very well for cleaning, drying and storing lettuce from the garden.
Even if you just need to dry your socks this works fantasitcally!  It washes, dries and stores well.
This is the second one we've bought (the first was disassembled by our kiddo) and love it just as much.
Dig it!  Get some salad spinner!  Get some :-)Seriously though, it works great.
It kind of limits how much solid matter you can put there while still putting the lid on fully.
if you fill with cauliflower, you have to leave a dip in the center for the lid to sit all the way down.
I've eaten a heck of a lot more salad since buying this product.
That alone should tell you that it's a good product.
However, I'll expand on that with some more details.Pros:- Salad keeps a LOT longer.
No more of those mushy pieces at the bottom of the bag/bowl.
It all stays nice, crisp, and fresh.- It's extremely easy to wash.
Use the colander to wash it, then put it in the spinner and empty out the water.
Simple.- Put the colander in, attach the lid, and press the button a few times.
It's easy to do and gets most of the water off without extra work.- Doesn't slide around on the counter or move.
You can just press the button a few times and let it go.- Very easy to clean.
No nooks, crannies, or crevices for stuff to get into.Cons:- The "stopper" button doesn't function very well any more.
It's been about 4 months, and it feels like it is wearing down.
It's not a big deal since it does stop on its own eventually.
After researching a bunch of spinners I settled on this one because of the reviews.
It really spins the water out and I can put alot of veggies in this at once.
The water catching bowl is great to use as a big salad serving bowl too.
The only con is it's size: It's huge.
BUT, that's also what I like about it, that it's so big it can spin lots of stuff at once.
It quickly, and effectively, spin dries the lettuce and looks good doing it.
We received one of these salad spinners as a gift 10 years ago, and we use it on a regular basis.
This salad spinner will make it possible for the salad to be eaten entirely before the salad leaves expire, leaving no waste.
This product is well made, durable, easy to clean, fun to use, and it really does what it's supposed to do.
Yes, will have a yummy salad tonight, now that I don't have to dry lettuce leaves on paper towels anymore.
i had one before but don't know what happened to it......maybe I gave it away by mistake.
I was surprised how big the spinner was when I received it.
But its a perfect size since my family eats a lot of salad.
The only thing I didn't know about the spinner was, on the bottom there is no holes.
So don't add too much water when using it.
I started working nights and my wife does not cook so I had to start pre-making dinner.
This item has been a lifesaver to create fresh salads which can be stored.
I can use the bowl to ice bath the lettuce and then empty it into the collander and dry it.
I also use the bowl to then toss the salad with dressing.
This item also allows me to wash fresh fruit like starberries and grapes, then spin dry and store in tupperware for the week.
Don't skimp, get the big one, you will need it.
This one was a gift, but I have an identical one (although not green).
I use it all the time, and it works wonderfully.
It's a bit bulky to store, but I especially love it during the summer when I'm getting lots of fresh greens in my CSA share.
I wash them and dry them in this, and then I store them in this in the refrigerator.
It works perfectly as a crisper in the fridge, and keeps greens fresh and crisp up to two weeks, which is kind of amazing.
My husband and I do lots of cooking and had an OXO salad spinner for years.
It finally gave out and we replaced it with a salad spinner from another &#34;trusted brand name&#34;.
It broke within a week, the spin was so weak it didn't remove any moisture whatsoever.
I found this brand new and slightly restyled OXO and bought it immediately.
The OXO spins lettuce, cabbage, spinach quickly and easily.
With the new clear bowl you can see how much water is coming off of the freshly leaves.
I haver never used it but my wife can't say enough about how much easier and more efficient it is compared to our older model.
We love to have a fresh salad, especially in the spring, summer and fall when the produce is less expensive.
We always make sure that we thoroughly wash the produce to avoid any issues with contamination.
We use this all the time and it has held up very well.
This is a great product and well worth the money if you eat a lot of salads!.
I like it ,that's why I gave it 5 stars.
Unless of course I want to make people aware of a bad product.So if you don't see my name that means I liked it.
If I don't like it you will see me bitch.
I've held off on buying this for a long time because I had a hard time parting with $30 for a plastic bowl.
As you would expect from OXO, it's very well made.
OXO always has the best products--definitely the best value.
The top handle makes the bowl spin fast so the lettuce dries in no time.
It even has a little break to stop the bowl from spinning.
The large bowl is the perfect size for a bag of lettuce.
OXO has a smaller version to consider before you buy this unit.
I'm so glad I finally bought a salad spinner, and I have no complaints about OXO's salad spinner.
I use it for small herbs and lettuce as well as a temporary strainer (the inside part only, of course).
There's a rubber brake on the top to stop the spinning almost instantly.
If you cook with a lot of herbs or make a lot of salads, this item is extremely valuable to your kitchen collection.
I owned a more expensive salad spinner that gave out after a decade or so.
In October 2007 I ordered my first OXO Salad Spinner.It was used almost daily for five and a half years with no big problem.
My only negative is that cleaning the lid is difficult.Some strength is needed to press the tabs to separate the lid's two pieces.
The tabs on mine become brittle and one snapped off somewhere around 2010, but the spinner still did what it was supposed to do.
Repeated use, hard water and the dishwasher have clouded and pitted the bowl.
I am using the pending annual influx of summer house-guests as my reason for replacing my first OXO Salad Spinner.
The price is the same I paid in 2007.
We had crisp rust-free lettuce even after,lettuce count them.
I love this salad spinner, it spins really fast and does the best drying job of any others I have tried.
It really spins the salad leaves well with minimal effort.
I now use it every time I have salad.
NO MORE WET SALAD!In addition, there are multiple uses with the bowl.
Serve your salad in it, store your salad in it, etc.
Wheee!!! You get to watch the salad spin all around and the lettuce get dizzy.
Clear bowl makes for a good serving bowl too!.
This is a large rig that works well.
I find  some Oxo stuff a bit silly with all the big rubber handles, but this is well-designed.
It is the best thing I could of bought for my salads and sprouts.
I almost didn't buy it thinking I could do with out but I am so happy I changed my mind.
I would give it more then 5 stars if I could.
Uses one in one home and bought this one for the winter snowbird place so we have used it for quite a while.
I've used other spinners, they're alright, none of them is as good as the OXO spinner.I use mine regularly, and for all sorts of things.
Lettuce washes and dries nicely in here, but so does most produce whether cut or whole.
If you eat a lot of produce, this is absolutely worth the money, and not just a gimmicky device that will take up space.
Reading over some recent reviews I can't believe the belly aches.
Who puts a salad spinner in the dishwasher?  Just rinse the lettuce bits off and let it air dry.
This unit is well designed and comfortable to use.
Why do I give it only 4 stars?  After about 3 years the spinning mechanism on the lid came apart on mine.
I was able to snap it together but it periodically comes apart.
The act of pushing down hard on the mechanism over and over is just tough on a relatively cheap plastic object.
All salad spinners have some variant of this problem, though.
Pull cord ones get tangled or rotted cords.
Go with the Good Grips - they're easy on the hands.
This has got to be the best salad spinner ever, on that point I agree with all the other rave reviews.
The plastic will have some staining over time but doesn't effect the use of the product.
I would buy another any time I needed one.
The top pump part does lock down for easier storage.
It's rare that you get a product that exceeds your expectations.
This is one of those cases.I make a lot of salads and was really getting tired of waiting for the lettuce to dry.
This thing spins so fast and for so long after a few pushes of the button, it's amazing.
I took out my Arugula and spinach, and couldn't believe how dry it was.
I finally bought one of these so I could buy farmer market lettuce for $1, and it last for 2 to 3 meals.
I recently read that pre-washed lettuce was dirtier then regular lettuce, so I'll never go back to store bought pre-washed salad mix.
This thing is awesome and with over 300 reviews and a near perfect 5-star rating you already know this.
THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE SALAD SPINNER BUT CAVEAT EMPTOR!!! THE INSTRUCTIONS LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED.
HOWEVER, IF THE BASKET IS NOT PLACED JUST SO, THE SPINNER WILL NOT TURN PROPERLY.
THIS WAS SO FRUSTRATING UNTIL 2 PEOPLE, ONE AN ENGINEER, FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS WRONG.
THAT SAID, IT WORKS PERFECTLY FOR SMALL AMTS OF  GREENS.
THE ABILITY TO STORE THE  DRY LETTUCE IN THE SPINNER IS A PLUS.
HAVE NOT USED IT ON HERBS OR BERRIES YET BUT I AM SURE IT WILL BE GREAT.
I spent a long time buying bagged lettuce that seemed to go rotten the second I opened it.
Finally fed up, I got this salad spinner and haven't looked back.
You can fit a lot of lettuce in this and it keeps fresh for a good few days before it needs to be eaten.
I've definitely already saved more by buying lettuce heads and using this than the icky bagged stuff.
Oxo makes great products and this is no different.
I like the product and find it works very well.
I would recommend it to anyone who wants to wash lettuce with a very efficient washer.
How they called it large I'll never know as it is much smaller than the OXO.
Do not waste your money on the Chef'n or other wannabes, go with the OXO.
I feel even the bagged salads must now be washed also, especially after the spinich e.
I used to buy full leaf lettuce and wash then dry on papertowels individually.
This makes it so much easier! Bagged salads last longer when I store in here instead.
I buy a lot of bag salad, and in a day or two one can see how much moisture builds up inside.
I transfer the bags over to the spinner and it's no problem any longer.
Glad I took the advice of other reviewers, this is a definitely a well made spinner.
I am eating more salads now than ever.
I am very satisfied and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a good salad spinner.
I also store my leftover salad right in the bowl in the fridge and it stays nice and fresh.
The cheaper ones do some good but not like this.
And, if you haveweak hands or arms or shoulder problems, this is for you!.
I grew up in a household in which no one had even heard of a salad spinner let alone used one.
I have worked for several years in the restaurant industry and I find having a salad spinner indispensable.
You get your greens much cleaner and they are nice and dry when you finish so the dressing doesn't slide off.
I use the outer bowl to soak the greens in and then I dump them in the strainer part and spin away.
You will wonder what you did before you owned this.
The unit is easy to take apart and clean (it really only requires a quick rinse).
I got this for my son for Christmas and we gave it a try one night before he took it home.
It did a great job spinning the water out.
It's very sturdy, but I used the bowl as a mixing bowl once and the inside got lots of visible scratches.
I bought my spinner from Amazon in 2003 for not too much less than they cost now.
It makes the salads much more pleasant to eat.
I've also used this to store washed salad in the refrigerator.
I already had the larger salad spinner but added this one after my children moved off.
The smaller size does not require as much dishwasher space and is perfect when cooking for one or two.
We had a pull cord style we hated as it wore out quickly.
Our second one was a kitchenaid and we liked it well enough and felt lucky that it lasted a year.
This one is great--the plunger feels like it will last a lifetime and the bowl keeps the lettuce crisp when we use it for storage.
My one complaint is that the bowl is on the small side.
We've had three different salad spinners in the last 10 years.
I know, control freak but it is my kitchen.
It is so much easier to use than the other ones we had.
Some other models have holes in the bottom for the water to drain out as you spin.
The problem is that they leak if you don't have it over the sink.
The knob is a comfortable rubber (like most Oxo products).Highly recommended for rinsing and drying lettuce and other vegetables.
bought it figuring I wouldn't use it that often -- I was wrong.
I not only use it to wash salad greens, I use it for beans when making bean salad, and other veggies as well.
it handles it well and is fun and easy to use.
The clear plastic has gotten foggy looking, but I don't care.
Haven't yet used it much but it seems very well built and like it will do the job.
I love my iceberg but am slowly accepting more romaines, leafy others too.
Very simple to use and easy to clean.It makes preparing salad greens a simple task.
I purchased this replacement after considering other brands -- saw that the pullstring types etc had mixed reviews.
Very pleasant to look at vs the clinical clear, black and white looksof the original.
It is absolutely amazing how much water rinses from the lettuce.
No more drying lettuce on papertowels or awkward tastes from residual water.
Great clear bowl for also serving the salad too!.
I bought this to replace a KitchenAid spinner.
The models work with the pump, so they seem to &#34;dry&#34; the greens comparably.The pluses to the OXO vs.
My wife saw this on a cooking show and decided she wanted one.
I purchased it as a Valentine's day gift.
OK, it's not the most romantic gift, but I took her to dinner, too.
Anyhow, she loves it and uses it all the time.
So far, it has worked well with no signs of breaking.
I have several OXO products so when I purchased this, I expected a great product.
It spins the water out of my salad preparations with minimal effort by me.
It is easy to clean and you can store your lettuce in the container, as well.
It quickly removes a tremendous amount of liquid from whatever you spin.
This is a great salad spinner - easily gets all the water out of  your greens.
I even use it for storing extra greens I don't use in the fridge.
It's a lot easier than cranking and helps hold the spinner in place as you push down on it; almost a one-handed operation.
I have used it to spin salads, and a bunch of cabbage before salting it into the saurkraut crock.
A bit pricey, but so convenient it's a wash.
We had the original Oxo spinner for years but it was lost in the recent Sandy storm in NJ.
We reordered our old favorite and were surprised to receive this new model.
It's more stoutly constructed than before and the shape is a little different, making the moisture extraction more efficient.
Best of all it's a lot easier to clean the top.
All to often improvements to a successful product are anything but; this is a happy exception.
I'd seen a review of this on some blog site awhile back so gave it a try.
It is much, much improved from the old spinners and does a wonderful job getting rid of excess moisture in the lettuce.
I am glad I tried it because it is now a staple in my kitchen.
The green just adds more of an aesthetic flair to it.
I've never had a problem with it, have had it for awhile.
Oxo usually always stands behind their products, and pride themselves in making quality products in general.
Though I'm bias and am clearly an oxo junkie, I love this.
I use it for herbs, salads, washing and drying fruits, veggies and even pasta.
The rubber ring on the bottom of the bowl is probably my favorite part-I like it more than I thought I would.
So I got this one and love the pump-spin action.
A cheaper model I had cracked after a year.
purchased this spinner to replace an old and wharped on, works like a charm.
the spinning handle is very smooth and fairly quiet, dries veggies enough.
This was an early Christmas gift from my husband (since he FOUND his present in the closet early).
I've been wanting this since seeing it mentioned in, I think it was, Cooks Illustrated magazine.
I haven't gotten to use it much, but what use it's had so far, it's great!.
Not any more!  This salad spinner does the trick to remove water from every nook and cranny.
It is a decent size when cleaning salad for one or a group.
It also works well as a serving bowl.
I have had this spinner for about 6 months and I love it.
I have a very small kitchen and the large spinner is just too large to store.
This one will hold 1 romaine heart at a time so I just do several batches of lettuce at once.
The money I saved on lettuce alone paid for this very quickly.
Also the little black button you see in the photo stops the spinning-very nice to be able to do.
I'd been wanting a salad spinner for several years.
I did my research and the Oxo won! You can't beat a salad spinner that can also store the lettuce.
And the price was much better than its competitors.
Works well removing water after rinsing salad ingredients and is quality made.
This salad spinner is easy to set up and use.
It gets the lettuce really dry, which makes the dressing stick to it better (for a yummier salad!).
It is bulky, so storage might be a problem if your kitchen is crowded.I also recommend the accessory kit.
It includes a plastic lid for storage (why this isn't included with the spinner is a mystery) and a useful lettuce knife.
My spinner finally gave out and no one makes it anymore.
I prefer the string pull as i feel it gets the water out faster and better but this is a close second.
This spinner is really nice! I got the smaller one and it is a perfect size! Thick plastic and the spinner push works great.
It really does get all the water out.
The push stopper works great but i feel it has a time limit as to how long it will last but lets see.
Spins easily, drains well and it doubles for holding the lettuce in over night  after spinning.
Sturdy made and is actually nice enough to pop on the table for dinner.
Again, I am amazed at the versatility of this spinner.
I find that I can keep my salad GREEN and unspoiled for about 3 weeks.
Normally, am afraid of these things, because they usually promise more than they give, but believe you will love it.
It even has a brake on it!!  I find gentle pushing of the plunger on top is best.
After reading some other ratings that others had trouble with breakage, I was a bit concerned, but all worries aside.
Really awesome product!  Especially with the little break button to stop the spinning almost instantly.
My only reason for not giving full stars is because of the motor.
It's so big that it takes up quite a bit of space inside so you can't fit as much of whatever you're spinning.
If the design was made with the motor somehow built on the outside, it would be perfect!.
I had one of the spinners that you had to crank, was tiring and slow.
This spinner works very easily by pushing the button on top.
My only complaint would be that it doesn't completely dry the lettuce but it is dry enough to use.
This was recommended by Cook's Country, and it doesn't disappoint.
I have nothing bad to say about this spinner.
It is big and a pain to store.
Love this thing! And it feels so sturdy and well made, I think it will last a really long time.
Before getting this we would wash and dry the salad greens and making our salad took too much prep time.
This has made life much easier, it dries the greens and is very easy to wash & dry in dishwasher.
But if you do not spin salads all the time, think about how much space you have.
You kitchen can get full with all these extra products you only use once in a way.
I got this spinner and like it but it's way too big for my needs.
Maybe if you have a family of 8, this would work just fine.
I purchased this salad spinner to replace an old one that was falling apart.
What an improvement!  I like the way this one doesn't slide around on the counter when it's in use.
I love the "push button" operation--much easier to use than cranking a handle on my previous spinner.
It's a great little product--I'd recommend it to anyone.
Loved it so much I bought 2 more, one for our summer rental and one for a friend.
Can store greens in refrigerator after spinning, can use basket to wash vegetables, can even use bowl to serve salad.
Nice that the top locks down to save storage space.
Also rubber anti skids are a nice touch.
We bought this at the recommendation of a friend.
The kids like using it when helping out in the kitchen.
I had the original model for over 15 years when it broke.
I like this one better because it comes apart for cleaning and keeps the lettuce crisp.
I used to move the greens to a lettuce keeper after washing but now they stay perfectly crisp in the salad spinner.
I like it more than any other brands.
I wish I pound get a bigger size to wash lettuce as well.
I love this product and it stays on my counter as I use it practically everyday.
I love the way the lettuce comes out---dry and fresh looking.
Love the convenience of putting salad greens in and spinning the water out.
No more soggy salads.No more watered down dressings.
The OXO salad spinner is the best one we have used in our household.
It is very easy to pump (and it will keep spinning for a long time).
The brake will bring it to a stop in a short time.
The outside bowl can be used to rinse greens before spinning.
I bought this salad spinner when the one I purchased at Target broke.
It had a pull cord that jammed, so I was looking to avoid that feature.
I normally do two spins to be very thorough.
I spin once, open it up, take out the basket, tip out any liquid, shake the lettuce in the basket, reassemble and spin once more.
If you're prepping a lot of greens, I recommendProgressive International LKS-06 Lettuce Keeperto store lettuce for a week+.
Also, this might just be me, but I'm not totally comfortable using the bowl to serve from as others have described.
But, as mentioned on America's Test Kitchen, dont overload the spinner, and dont expect the greens to be bone dry.
The only thing that competes is the time honored method of whirling a pillowcase with your greens.
There is also a cover that you can use, if you wish to store the greens in the frig for a period.
This is a nice item to clean your salad mixings.
It is easy to clean and I would highly recommend this.
Wonderful spinner! We use it all the time, its very sturdy and easy to use.
If it breaks I'll buy another one here.
This was a gift from my husband and kids to me for Mother's Day.
Well, honestly I emailed my husband the link and said "I want something like this" :)  Nonetheless!  It's perfect, excellent and awesome.
This is a big mama, so make sure you can store it.
Ironically, I've used it for everything BUT lettuce!  I use it for grapes, rinsing black beans, strawberries, etc.
For lettuce, you can do full pumps and it'll be amazing.
For my grapes and whatnot, I do a mini pump or two so as not to bruise up the fruit and it's gentle enough.
I love this product...can't say enough!  Also, I use this for hard boiled eggs.
I boil them, then put them in here, fill it with ice water and let them chill.
The I just pull out the strainer and the water is left behind.
You could also use the strainer for other things...however I will mention is is thin and not flimsy...but also not super sturdy.
Of course this is on purpose so that it can spin fast...so I'm ok with that.
Excellent product...probably overpriced...but it will last me forever and OXO is great at taking care of their customers.
I have never owned or even used a salad spinner before, so I can't compare it with other brands.
But, the Oxo Good Grips salad spinner was exactly what I wanted.
I have eaten salad many times since purchasing it.
My wife bought this a while back, and my first thought was that this was a gimmick designed to part a fool from his money.
This thing has saved me a lot of time in trying to dry my lettuce before preserving it or using it in my salads.
Looks like I was the fool for not believing in the hype, but this is well worth the small amount of money spent.
OK, it's just a salad spinner, but this one has a different design from the type of spinner that you crank around.
You push down on a large button and the basket spins rapidly.
The button pops back up; push down again to give the backet a longer ride.
The action takes less effort than the crank type, and the rapid spin speed casts off almost all the water on the vegetables.
You can live without a salad spinner but it is nice to have one.
This one does a nice job of drying off greens.
Also, greens stored in the spinnner in the fridge really do keep longer.
There is one caveat for those with small and/or crowed refridgerators - it takes up a fair amount of shelf space.
Like all Oxo products that I have experience with, it is well made.
I have tried many different spinners over the years and this by far has been the best one.
I have dropped this off the counter a few times and it has not cracked or broke in any way.
Works great and allows for rinsing the veggies/fruit/salad inside the bowl before spinning them dry.
Before Hurricane Katrina, I owned both a large and small OXO GOOD GRIPS salad spinner.
They are the easiest to use for arthritic hands.
Just push down on the top, and it spins it's little heart out.
And it has a button to put the brakes on!! I had used several types before these, but these are by far the best.
I should have checked the size of this before ordering.
It has capacity sufficient to spin enough salad for 2 or maybe 3 people; that's it.
Our lettuce came out absolutely dry, almost as if I'd hand dried each and every leaf.
I tend to keep kitchen tools until they keel over.
The good people at America's Test Kitchen rate it at the top of the spinner scale.
I originally had given this style of spinner a pass because I could not visualize it working.
Alton Brown recommends soaking salad greens in cold water and then giving them a good spin before wrapping them in paper towels for storage.
Once they have soaked for a few minutes, I removed the colander gizmo out and drained the bowl.
Notably, there were the grit and other nasties in the bowl for me to dump.
Then with a quick couple of pumps, I had crisp salad greens for lunch.
I may order the large size because I like the small one so much.
As recommended, I store the washed greens in it and they keep twice as long as in a regular tupperware.
It is sturdy, very easy to use, and more effective at drying lettuce, etc.
The bonus is you can use it to store in the frig and it keeps salad beautifully.
No complaints from her lips to my ears.
I do not know what else to say about a salad spinner.
We eat a lot of greens so the way we wash  , dry it and store it is very important.
This baby is doing all of it + you can even serve them in a bowl.
Sturdy and esthetically pleasing for your eyes and touch is worth the money.
I bought this to replace my old OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner (OXO SoftWorks Salad Spinner) when the bowl shattered.
OXO has made several updates to the salad spinner, making it better than ever!I like the new bowl: it is made of thicker, sturdier plastic.
The wider, flat bottom makes the bowl very sturdy, and the new shape is easier to pick up.
I've had this for years now and use it about every other day.
I put it in the dishwasher, it comes apart easily and goes back together just as easy.
It is sturdy, it works well and when its life is over I want another one exactly like it.
The other spinners I had broke and were hard to clean.
The water was the biggest drawback for me making salads.
There's a little button to stop the spinning.
My salad gets nice and dry, and then I can use bowl to serve it in.
What a difference a few dollars make!  It does the job extremely well -- it's fast and effecient.
I love the stop feature and the rubberized footing that keeps it stable on the counter.
I purchased this salad spinner because I moved, and no longer had a roommate to mooch from.
It's solidly constructed, and the brake feature is nice.
I wonder if the push down/gearing drive will last longer or shorter than the pull-string variety2.
There's not much to say beyond the picture.
it is not only great looking but it does the job VERY well of spinning out water from salad greens.
This is one of the wisest purchases I've ever made.
I bought this salad spinner from Bed Bath & Beyond because it was cheaper.
I love to eat large dinner salads at least three times a week.
I use the inner colander to rinse the leaves free of soil, and then have a blast centrifuging the leaves until they are just moist.
It is a time and frustration saver for anyone who frequently prepares salad greens.
This one is great.Never be without one again.
The only downside is that for twenty dollars ($20+tax!!!) the plastic bowl feels rather flimsy and threatens to crack if not handled with care.
I expected better quality from an Oxo product.
product is holding up well after tons of use.
the spinner is easy to clean and also easy to store.
There's a very good reason why this item has so many reviews and such a high rating - it works.
I'm not entirely confident in the &#34;pre-washed&#34; mixes.
There is a non-slip surface on the bottom, so this thing won&#8217;t go slipping away from you while in action.
This same mechanism can be locked down for easier storage.
It even comes with a braking button to slow down and stop the spinner.
I've avoided making salads for a long time because of the preparation time.
One easy push and it spins on its own and it does not move around at all on the counter.
I've had leaf lettuce in mine for several days, and it is still crisp and fresh.
Since buying this remarkable spinner, I've had salad every night.
And enjoyed every minute of it, preparation included!If you love salads but hate the prep, get this.
You will wonder how you ever got along without it.
This is the best designed salad spinner I've ever used.
Here's why:  1)The inner bowl spin drys any lettuce/veggie contents perfectly.
2)Push the top black knob, bowl spins w/little effort, for the perfect amt.
3)The side black button can also be used to stop the spinning at any time.
of salad/herbs/berries, but won't take up anymore cabinet space than ur current spinner.
It can also dry smaller amts of herbs.
It is also highly recommended by "Cooks Illustrated Magazine" & won the top prize in their review of salad spinners (and they're tough critics).
There's a newer version out now that looks a bit prettier, but this baby works great.
I wouldn't eat salad or herbs that haven't been washed by me, and this is the easiest way to wash and dry the greens.
I bought this as a gift for my mom, and she loves it too.
Easy to wash salad in, and then it dries it (fast!) to a perfect condition - ready to eat, not to slurp.
It does what I bought it to do.
One small problem...I have a some arthritis in my fingers so I have trouble when I take the lid apart to clean it.
This is not something I have to do often.
It gets my garden greens dried quickly and I really like that.
So, If it ends up sitting out on my prep counter for a couple of days, that's fine.
I bought this because it came in as the top spinner on one of those cooking sites.
Although I like it a lot, it does tend to bounce around on the countertop (I have granite so maybe that's the reason).
From the previous testing, I expected it to stay put better.
Also, I honestly don't think it gets my greens as dry as my old hand-crank spinner.
But it's larger than what I had so it's a keeper.
I just have to spin more and then lay the greens on a paper towel for a bit.
We used to buy those bags of pre washed lettuce in the grocery store and they would spoil so quickly and were not great.
I bought this so we could buy fresh lettuce instead and it has impressed me.
Lettuce stays fresh for days- we store the leftover lettuce in it in the fridge and it's amazing.
Fun for the kids to help spin the salad too.
Overall, I highly recommend this product if you like your lettuce clean and fresh!.
These days you cannot be too careful with the lettuce you purchase at the store.
E-coli or salmonella seem to be a common concern.First of all you wan clean lettuce.
You use this bowl, take lettuce leaves apart in bite size pieces, fill with water, insert lettuce, don't crowd, swish round and then empty.
If there is grit in the bottom, wash lettuce again.
You need at least three or four complete turns.
Empty water, and then spin again to make sure all the waters gone.
A good green salad uses only dry lettuce.Use three or four different lettuces for your salad.
Make a large bunch, and then save some for the rest of the week.
Wrap the greens in paper twel and place in a reveal able plastic bag.
The lettuce will stay god for three or four days.Use a nice balsamic homemade dressing or use lemon, salt and pepper.
The Large size OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner seems to be well made.
The gauge of plastic used is heavier than most other models, and the rubber-edged bottom keeps the spinner from sliding around.
Easy to clean, and the cover can be disassembled for cleaning as well.
This is the best salad spinner I've ever used.
This is the best thing since fresh oven baked bread for my sprouting endevours.
I use the Easy Sprouter to start my seeds...usually the "salad varieties" such as alfalfa, radish, etc.
All the hulls float to the top where I can easily get rid of them.
I usually take a reg table knife and put it between the lid and the bowl on one side so there's fresh air circulating inside.
I leave this on the counter and rinse twice a day for two or three more days and then put in the frig.
Sprouts keeps perfectly for days in the spinner while I start the next batch in my Easy Sprouter.
Works well, good quality, I can use the bottom as a serving bowl.
A bit too small for our five member family.
Wish it came with a lid to take on potlucks.
It doesn't spin as fast as I would like, but the little "brake" button is nice.
If you have limited storage space consider a smaller model.
I'd probably have picked a collapsible model if i had another chance.
It works great, is low profile and easy to store and it looks fine in the kitchen.
I was using a Pampered Chef salad spinner that cost almost 3x the money and it wasn't nearly as easy to use.
We eat fresh salad every day and couldn't live without a salad spinner.
First off, this is a well made unit.
I'd trade it for a well made gear driven unit any day.This might be a 5 Star unit for someone who doesn't mind the noise.
If you want to get a bit fancy with your salad spinning, this is the one to buy.
You release the lock mechanism at the top and press down.
The inner basket starts to spin, removing most of the water from the lettuce.
I love the fact that you can rinse the lettuce in the removable inner basket.You really win with this one.
Wash, spin, store...so much less to wash and it is never boring.
Once you have spun the lettuce you can remove the inner bowl and dump out the water.~The Rebecca Review.
This is the best salad spinner I've used.
It really does get rid of excess water and it's easy to clean.
I have avoided salad spinners for years because of past disappointments.
But when the guys on Americas Test Kitchen made this one their first choice I decided to try again.
We had the old version of this spinner and it finally broke.
Ordered this one to replace it and it was immediately clear this newer model was of superior build quality and durability.
I think this one will last much longer.
If you eat any greens, this salad spinner is a must have.
It can fit a lot, is durable, good for storing washed lettuce, and easy to clean.
I have had this salad spinner for a year now and have had no problems and bought one for my mother to use as well.
Great salad spinner that is easy to use, clean and store.
I would recommend one for every kitchen I use it all the time.
The bowl is very large and will accomodate a hefty amount of greens.
I buy salad that comes in bags..I always washed it first and tried many ways to get it dry.
but it never dried enough so it would wilt and get ucky within 1 day.
I have never used a salad spinner before this one and never understood what was so special about them until recently.
It just seemed like another lazy persons contraption, but then again I was buying bagged salad.
So now I'm not only saving money on buying unprepared salad fixings, but also not creating as much waste in packaging and food.
We grow most of our own leafy greens, and this thing makes it even more rewarding than it would otherwise be.
The hard bowl ensures your salad spinners will not change shape while drying over dishes, thus not working until reshaped.
I really think OXO fit the nail on the head with this one.
The pump can even be stored in the down position to serve as a storage vessel for your greens!.
This replaced a pretty lame hand spinner and we are pleased.
It is larger, more solid, and much easier to operate.
It has a central hand button that you press repeatedly.
I wouldn't prepare a salad without my salad spinner.
Placing a paper towel in with the greens helps dry them faster, too.Recently I found a new use for the basket and bowl.
They work great for rinsing and sorting dried peas or beans.
Do this a few times and your dried veggies are ready to cook or soak.
You can let them soak in the bowl if you wish.
This beats my old way of washing dried peas or beans in a heavy bowl or pot.
Firstly this is bigger than you think so measure it out before you order and check you have space to store it.
Its very fun to use and I find I do need the capacity, the small one would be too small.
I stop it mid spin, jostle and spin again or I find it doesn't quite dry everything.
The lid is in two parts for some reason which makes this a bit bulker on the draining board than needs be.
Bought one for my FIL as he found it so fun to use.
I had an old salad spinner that finally died so my husband picked up a cheapy at Walmart.
It had a cord that frayed and broke after only six months.
I bought this one on Amazon and am very happy with it.
This is just yet another well thought-out product from OXO.
It does exactly what it sets out to do - spin your greens - with suitable competence and a minimum of drama.
It stays put pretty well in use and is entirely ambidextrous.
For the price vs number of uses, I can't complain.
The bowl has been through the dishwasher many times.
No complaint there - lots of plastic things get soft in the dishwasher.
The basket just seems to suffer more because it's larger than any other of my plastic items.
This OXO mini salad and herb spinner seems to be holding up the one I bought 6 months ago hadit's spring break after 5 uses.
BIG MISTAKE as the newer one seem to havea very fragile mechanism.
Washing and adequately drying the greens for a salad has always been a pain.
My daughter has one of these and they have salad every night.
It greatly reduces the time needed to prepare a salad with cleaning of the greens.
I can use it for the next meal.
I read some other reviews that this does not get the lettuce super dry.
I agree that it does not completely dry the lettuce, but it works well enough that the dressing can still stick.
We had been buying the bagged greens, but with the e coli scare we decided no more of that.
It is very easy to use, the spin mechanism works like an old-fashioned children's top.
Excellent product.Update:  February 2010I am still using the salad spinner on a regular basis.
Obviously, it's proven to be very durable, and a good investment.
I can now take my salads to work for lunch without getting them soggy by the time I eat them.
To have it function better, place it on a flat surface before spinning it.
The larger bowl can be used for other purposes in the kitchen and so can be the sieve.
we already have the larger one at our house, and bought the smaller one for the apartment.
You need this if you every make salads.
The quality is great and it works perfectly.
We have had the same one for about five years now, and it is always in use.
We run it through the dishwasher and still holds up great.
We would recommend it as a great gift.
Hopefully the quality is still as good as it was when we got ours.
Use one of these daily for five years or so and you might have to replace it.
I purchased this a few years back (not from amazon) and loved it.
It was big enough to wash a whole green leaf lettuce, spinned nicely, and removed most of the water.
However, the lid was accidentally dropped on  the kitchen tile floor and a part on the bottom cracked.
The button would push down but not come back up and start the spinning.
I tried unsuccessfully to keep using it but it was more effort than it was worth.So.
yes I would recommend it, but NEVER drop the plastic lid, as it's the hard type of plastic and will crack on a hard surface.
The transparency of the base was really nice to see how much water had been spun out.
My slippery formica countertop is not so nice when things skate off onto the floor.
To me, this is the perfect size for a nice large salad, enough to serve up to 4 people.
Big plus is that it is small enough to make it easy to store, doesn't take up half my cabinet shelf.
Don't wait! Grab it now! This is truly the very best spinner on the market!.
Doesn't take up a lot of space in the refrigerator.
Very easy to use, very easy to clean.
This is such a good looking salad spinner i would like to display it somewhere in my kitchen.
It works beautifully and fulfills my every salad spinning need.
Some people think it's expensive, but it seems worth every penny to me.
This was a big hit with one of my daughters for Christmas.
It was by special request and now she would not be without the spinner.
It was recommended by Cook's Country as the best one so that is why I picked this brand.
I'm going to be eating a lot healthier after getting this great tool, I'll tell you that.
Suddenly, mixing salads has become a piece of cake, with the water going to the bottom.
It keeps lettuce dry and crisp in the refrigerator.
In short, it makes salads worth the trouble again.
One salad can last us pretty much all week, depending on the ingredients.
I only wish it was a little bit cheaper, but that's only because I'm a cheapskate.
I'd avoid other brands, which have spotty durability records.(Oh, and we put ours in the dishwasher, top rack, without any trouble).
I got the big one so I can spin an entire head of lettuce.
I then put the lettuce in a ziploc and use it as needed for sandwiches, etc.
The top handle locks down for storage helping some with space as this one is pretty big.
This salad spinner is one of the easiest to use.
It holds a lot and really spin dries not only lettuce but pastas as well.
This is a great salad spinner, I especially love that I can leave the fresh salad greens in the spinner, and put in refrigerator.
Just the right size for a salad for two.
Very easy to use and like that I can save any left over in it.
Received in a timely manner.***Update 2/27/12Was only able to use it once, when I tried to use it a second time the top mechanism broke.
I called OXO and they told me they would send me a replacement top, that I would receive it in 10 working days.
Today I received it, but it was the wrong top, too small and different color.
I would not had mined the different color if it would fit.
Suffice to say I am very disappointed, feel as if I bought a very expensive bowl with no cover.
Have not decided if I will call the company again.
If I do I will update.***Update 3/8/12Called OXO back and they were very apologetic and they Federal Expressed me a new top that works flawlessly.
I am so happy to have a working salad spinner and that OXO did not disappoint me because I love their products.
To be honest I was pleasantly surprised with their customer service.
I was skeptical but i am now a believer.
It is gross to see all the crappy water that comes off after spinning!.
Ever bought lettuce or spinach and, after 3 days in the fridge, find that it's turning to a slimy mess?  Got concerns about E.
coli and other bacteria on your leafy greens?If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner.
And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want.1)  Put your veggies in the bowl.
Pour a cup of white vinegar over it, and fill with cold water.
This salad spinner does an awesome job dehulling home grown sprouts.
I seems to be well built and is easy to clean.
EVen did a great, gentle, job with Berries.
Was given to me as gift, when I was in a tiny apartment.
I had no cabinet space so it became a, decorative piece above my fridge when not in use.
Had mine for several years and it does the job.
It is easy to disassemble and clean which is a big plus.
They thought of EVERYTHING when they designed this salad spinner.
I got the little one and it is just right for spinning lettuce for 2 and then storing the remainder in the spinner.
It definitely causes the lettuce to last longer!  :-)  AAAA for this product!!.
This spinner is easy to use and compact.
I purchased it to replace a larger, bulkier spinner I had.
I'm very pleased with the performance and ease of use.
If you need a spinner, this is a good one.
But if you're going to do a large amount of greens, you may want a bigger version.
The bowl is large and also doubles as a serving bowl.
The product works great, and looks fun too.
It's exactly what I've come to expect from the OXO line.
Does exactly what it is supposed to do.
It is so nice to have dry salad greens instead of soggy soup.
Well made and useful, especially for gardeners with lots of salad greens to clean and enjoy.
Used my daughter's salad spinner when I was visiting at Christmas.
They work great to get the water off the Romaine, instead of draining & drying with paper towels.
I then used the bowl to make the salad.
Very handy thing to have & helps making a salad to not be such a long process.
I held out against the salad spinner for a long time.
Well, I do love it, and I use it a lot!  It's not just for salad greens, but for anything you want to dry quickly.
It's sleekly designed with only three easy-to-clean pieces.
One quick plunge keeps the bowl spinning for quite a long time, but one touch to the button on the side stops it cold.
This week alone I've drained cabbage for slaw, grape tomatoes and cooked shrimp for a salad.
None of the food was damaged, and all of it was well-dried enough that I didn't have to worry about my dressing getting watered down.
It does what it promises to do and does it well, with a minimum of fuss.
That is, to my way of thinking, the mark of a great piece of equipment.
Given a choice, almost everyone would prefer fresh, clean vegetables and fruit.
Put your vegetables, fruit, or whatever you want to drain off excess liquids from, in the basket.
Place the basket in the bowl, resting on the center pin at the bottom of the bowl.
Release the spring loaded handle, and then while holding down the lid, push down on the handle a few times.
The centrifugal force generated from spinning the contents in the basket, draws liquid and small debris to the outer walls of the bowl.
The rubber on the bottom of the bowl provides traction, and helps keep the bowl from spinning, or tipping over, while you are pumping.
There is a button on the top of the lid that acts as a brake, and will slow and stop the basket.
To maintain a minimum profile, there is a sliding lever that locks down the spring loaded handle into the lid.
Although holding the lid down is recommended, even when spinning at high speed, the lid seems to stay in place pretty securely.
If you get one, the odds are very high that you will love it.
I eat a lot of salad so this is used a lot.
The pump and break are a must if you plan to use one a lot.
We have a hand crank one at work and it gets stuck all the time.
This is my first salad spinner so take this review as such.
I really don't have any previous models to base it on.
It is pretty big so make sure you have a place to store it because it will take up a lot of room.
I wouldn't trust storing anything inside the spinner because the basket is plastic and I would think it would become warped and than useless.
As long as you have the storage room the size is great.
There is a lock for the button to help protect the button and keep it out of your way when storing.
That lock works great and is easy to operate.
I have no complaints on the lock so we must move on to the button itself.
The spin action is achieved by pressing the big green button down a few times in a fast up and down motion.
Once the spinner is going there seems to be some movement of the whole unit on my all wood counter.
I could see it sliding right off a marble top counter without a towel underneath it.
The next function is the break to stop the spinner.
And when I say stop I mean slow down slowly.
The break does not impress me that much.
I do not want to wait 20 seconds holding a button down when the spinner would only take 40 seconds to stop on its own.
The product works fine over all and the only part I truly worry about breaking is the basket.
I am going to baby that basket because like I mentioned before any warps could prove bad for the spinner.
So far the item has worked like a champ and since december 17th 2012 I have used this product 13 times.
After several years of looking at these and thinking do I really need one I can now say YES I really do.
I was sure it was just one of those items that I would hardly use but I find different uses for it all the time.
With the pumping mechanism as opposed to pulling a string this is much better you don't have the bowl skidding off on you.
It sits out on the counter, as I use it so often.
I got so tired of wasting money on the prepackaged salads, because it would go bad shortly after opening the package.
So I buy bulk in all the salad greens, make enough salad to fill this container and then bag it myself.
Another plus is that it's easy to clean.
This is one heck of a spinner! I've darn near gotten up to centrafuge speeds with just a few easy pumps.
Great for drying off all kinds of fruits and vegetables.
What I use it for most is drying potato slices before making french fries.
If you have any problems gripping things in your kitchen, I strongly suggest looking over the full line of Oxo products.
The oversized handles (in this case, the part you press down rather than grip) are a godsend.
Don't let hand problems keep you out of your kitchen!.
Salad spinners are one of the most used kitchen utensils that we have.
This one is well built with hard plastic top and basin.
The spinner's gearing works well and has a smooth operation.
this thing is large, so plan on eating  alot of lettuce.
We used to do that with our last spinner.
We also did rinse lettuce one time and filled up bottom bowl with water, minor inconvience that we weren't used to.
The kids love to push this handle down.
$30 bucks to spin lettuce, not worth it to me.
We've been using this quite a bit lately, and I have to say it is incredibly handy for all sorts of greens and herbs.
Instead of sprint-like speed of rotation, its a spin is more akin to a steady marathon pace.
This Gadget is so simple to operate and it is kind of Fun, I think I'm gonna start spinning for Health again!.
My greatest "pet peeve" when preparing salads is WET soggy lettuce.
A couple of spins of my OXO Good Grips salad spinner has removed this nuisance from my life.
If you do enjoy fresh salads, greens or herbs, I promise you will use this tool frequently.
Pros:- Large capacity- Effective for spinning saladCons:- Big, for obvious reasonsIt's big! But then again, it's big.
This salad spinner is a clear winner! Just a few spins removes the water from your salad greens using centrifugal force.
It spins the greens so dry that I don't even bother blotting them with paper towels.
I purchased the large clear model and use it to store my greens after spinning the salad greens and pouring out the water.
i like that it has a push button versus the turn crank.
Started getting my veggies from the farmer's market.
This device not only leaves the leafy greens clean, it's fun!.
I have owned this apple slicer and corer for about four years.
It's currently cracking on a few sided and I will have to buy another one.
This worked for the short time but long term I would get an all metal apples slicer and corer.
My I make apple slices for my husband in his lunch and give them to my son at snack time.
So mine get's used on a daily basis for one of them.
For the most part this apple corer worked great while it lasted.
It is very sturdy and the blades are sharp.
I used to have an all-metal one (not OXO), but it would bend when I pushed down on it.
The OXO slices through the apple quickly and easily, and the rubber grips are easy on the hands.
I got the OXO now, and it's a pleasure to use.
Be cautious though, those blades are actually very sharp on the bottom side.
You may have recalled a previous apple slicer review of mine.
I enjoy them so much I can't help but review another one.
It's just a lot of fun taking an apple and slicing it into eight handy and adorable little slices.
Whether you use green apples, red apples, Granny Smith, whatever.
This slicer will deliciously make eating apples exciting.
If you're a child you can even enjoy eating healthy foods by using this product.
You won't have to mess around with no silly core.
Just don't go around shopping online without your parents permission.
Sometimes things just work and this does just that.
Use it and throw it in the dishwasher.
This is a nice little tool to have around the kitchen to save you a bit of time in slicing up an apple.
When you push down on the handle it cuts the apple up.
The only problem is that after you push down, you may have to push the apple slices through from the other side.
In other words, it doesn't cut all the way through the apple.
Put a plate in the sink and then put the apple on the plate and press down.
Sprays a bit of Apple Juice "Mist."Depending on form of apple will be ready to eat.
Otherwise must remove some left-over core with knife.Easy to remove skin after using with a knife.Overall good I guess quicker than cutting with knife.
I love this apple cutter! I hate biting into apples so this is the only way I will eat them.
I have to always make sure to pick up the cutter by the handles.p.s.
My mom has the Progressive version of this apple cutter and it doesn't work nearly as well.
The blades are not as sharp so I always have to strugle a little when I use hers.
I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine, and it works great.
He is very pleased, and it has helped him enjoy apples more often than he would otherwise, if he didn't have this great device.
As the title to this review states, this gadget makes dealing with apples and pears a breeze.
My old cheapie version cracked and died when my daughter was visiting and attempted to slice a hard apple.I replaced it with this one.
I must warn you that the fruit must be somewhat firm because soft, overripe fruit will smoosh into a mess.
It's a cinch to use.Guests that are not aware of the existence of such a culinary tool will be wowed by it.
If you have questions, please reply in the Comment section below...I would be glad to help.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________CHECK OUT MY BLOG: thegoodstuffreviews.blogspot.com.
You get a sturdy slice no matter what size of apple you are slicing and coring.
I had an old corer and it was a pain.
I bought this and used it twice now.
I make apple pies and it makes life a lot easier.
Be careful though,  It is so sharp I cut my finger on it.
I cut my left ring finger that required stitches, unlike the other times when I cut fingers.
Since, I have an aversion to using a knife.
We got this Oxo Good Grips Apple Corer and Divider, and my problem with knives went away.
Now I am happier to cut my slices of apples without hurting myself.
We love this product, it has saved us a lot of time.
We began juicing a few weeks back and apples go into the majority of our recipes.
Tip: cut the bottom off the apple to make a flat surface before you use this.
Then press down firmly and voila!My only criticism is that the core gets stuck in the middle and you have to push it out.
But it's nice to have, especially during apple pie season.
So yeah, sorry Alton, I like this unitasker.
The core was gone and the apple was neatly divided.
The divided apple looked like a flower blossom.
Pushing down on the the corer/divider did not require much pressure.
It cut and sliced through the apple as smooth as silk.
Be careful when washing this tool as the blades are a bit sharp.
This is a great corer/divider and as a result I eat far more apples.
If you try to chop a large apple you have to really force the corer down.
As other reviewers have said, the blades are sharper than they look.
I wasn't too sure about this product, but figured I'd give it chance since there were so many positive reviews.
I'm glad I did! It works exactly as its suppose to; It removes the apple core and divides the rest into pieces.
It looks flimsy, but is actually quite durable.
there is not much you can say about a aple corer and divider it divides and cores.
I would recommend if you need to purchase.
My daughter loves me to slice apples for her, but in a hurry it can be time consuming.
If you simply grip the top of the apple that has already been cut and pull up, it will finish slicing through.
I love OXO brand and this is yet another product that they've made well!.
this OXO good grips apple corer and divider works great; it is very durable and easy to clean up; I use all the time.
OXO Good Grips Apple Corer and DividerI have to say i was skeptical.
If your apple is too big, it won't cut it.
If it's just right, this is the best way to get apple slices.
Saves time trying to core the apple - in 1 second your apple is core free, ready to be dipped or chopped smaller.
I love the idea of this device and it worked adequately.
it was a bit difficult to cut through the apple.
I had to use all my strength, and 2.
while it's not the device's fault, it's hard to align if the apple's core isn't directly beneath it's stem.
A little practice and I'm sure it will get easier to judge.
This aple divider works great!  The last one I had was made differently and would get apple fiber stuck in the middle of it.
We've had ours for quite some time and it's still good.
It's strong and I think it's really gonna last.
I cut my thumb on the blades when I opened the package, though, so be careful.
It cuts and cores and apple in seconds.
Make sure you get it straight and it works perfectly.
SOmewhat hard to clean is my only complain.
Great for creating snacks for work or for a fruit plate.
I absolutely love this apple/pear corer and divider.
Overall, I don't think you can go wrong with this product.
Works great and makes it easier to cut for my 4 yr old.
This works just as described - sharp blades cut right through the apple, leaving nice even slices.
The padded handle allows for better control when coring/slicing apple.
I liked using this product and the results of getting perfectly cored apple and slices.
The only drawback was the amount of force required to get through the apple.
This apple corer and slicer is great!  I love it and so does my child.
We are both eating more apples and pears now.
I like the Oxo better than the Calphalon Easy Grip Apple Slicer (http://www.amazon.com/Calphalon-Easy-Grip-Apple-Slicer/dp/B000SOAT0Y).
This keeps the blade sharper MUCH longer, especially if you cut on a ceramic plate like I do.
The Calphalon's larger handles are unnecessary and take up too much space in the &#34;gadget drawer&#34;.
Very easy to use, just place the apple under it and press down--presto, the apple wedges appear.
It does take a little effort to remove the wedges since the blades do not always cut all the way through the bottom skin.
Also, the apple must be carefully positioned so that all the core is removed by the center ring without leaving seed parts on the wedges.
Will be watching to see hos long it maintains its sharpness.
I'll never have to slice an apple with my trusty knife again.
I can't just bite into an apple (fragile teeth) so this does the trick for me.
This is nice and sharp!  The size is good for even big apples.
Our last slicer broke so I chose a different brand and am happy I did.
The 'profile' is flat enough that it doesn't jam our drawer which is handy!.
works great- still going strong no rust after 2 years.
I'm oxo obsessed so i would highly recommend this.
We purchased this corer/slicer to replace an existing OXO corer/slicer that was about 10 years old and used to slice hundreds of applies.
The new corer has slightly modified handles, but we have no reason to expect it to perform any differently from our old one.
Just wish it were a little nicer looking.
Yesterday morning, I cored and sliced over 230 apples.
I then dipped them in lemon juice and froze them.
Once frozen Ithem, I packaged them with a vacuum sealer.
Now I'll have apples all winter long and not have to buy them again.
My husband was amazed at this little inexpensive tool.
It works in less than a second and it's completely done! I wish I had the patent on it!.
It is very sharp, and should be handled carefully.
It's also a bit tough to get the core out of the middle after making the cut.
This is the first apple corer I've bought, and honestly I feel stupid for not buying one sooner.
I found this item to be exactly as described in advertisement.
I had debated about which one to get & this one has sharp metal blades for an easy cut.
The handles have a good grip which makes it comfortable & not slippery if your hands are damp or wet.
This looks like it will last for a very long time.
Works a lot better than the cheaper ones on the market it actuall cuts through the apple a lot easier.
Daily use for months now without a problem.
It works great on apples and pears, cuts them to 8 equal pieces.
The only criticism I have is sometimes it's hard to remove the core at the center, but otherwise it works really well.
This is especially true if your fruit is somewhat odd shaped--you may have to line up your stroke.
People even ask to borrow it when they're trying to slice up an apple with one of the dull cafeteria knives.
This apple corer and divider works really well and does what it should.
Once you have one, you can't go back.
There is nothing more to say about it.
Even if i wanted to what would i say, its an apple corer and divider.
This apple corer/slicer is a awesome for the non-OCD apple cutter.
It's sturdy and sharp and gets the job done well.
Most people would not be bothered by this, but as a microbiologist I find this very disconcerting and wishing it was one solid piece.
Aside from this little flaw, it's been a very wonderful little utensil.
excellent classic corer/slicer, but make sure sure apple isn't too big.
also really firm apples may break the handles.
I got this for myself to speed up making the kids' lunches and I love it.
It quickly cuts the apple into slices and removes the core.
This device is great for coring and dividing apples.
I plan to look into a peeler but this will do fine for now.
I love OXO products, since I know what I am getting in terms of quality.
I have had this for a year and use it more days than not.
It works great, but I will say it is harder to use in bigger apples.
Works great if you have a symmetrical apple to core.
otherwise sometimes you get part of the core and not all.
Used a lot when my kids were small, not as much now that they are older.
Comfortable to use, a bit big for storage in a drawer.
Since I am partially disabled, this makes it easy to add some fruit to my diet.
I used this for apples and found that it works well on totally round apples with a flat bottom.
If it is an uneven bottom of the apple it cuts it through the core rather than beside the core.
I respect their brand; otherwise I would have not tried this.
The only issue I have is that obviously the blades are sharp.
So pressing down on it using the side handles is the only option unless you want to cut your fingers.
Who needs a special tool to core and quarter an apple?Nobody really needs it unless they process a whole lotta apples.
But this tool works so perfectly and so quickly that it is just plain elegant and fun to use it.
The Oxo apple corer is easy to use, and the wide angle handles keep your hands out of the way of the apple.
I really like the grip material as it helps keep you steady on the downward press.
(original review from September 9, 2011)****edit June 20, 2014....Just purchased a second one of these corer/dividers, and not to replace the first one from 2011.
The 2011 one is still going!  This second one is to replace the numerous others ones that have broken since 2011.
I finally wised up and did not purchase the a replacement that hangs conveniently beside the apples in the local grocery store.
And instead, ordered and received my second Oxo apple corer.
From a household who uses the product daily, and has used and broken numerous other brands, buy a long lasting OXO.
I cut an apple every day for breakfast and this corer and divider has been working strong for 3 years now.
Since apples are seldom perfect, this sometimes requires a bit of cleverness.
The device doesn't always cut cleanly all the way through the bottom of the apple.
This is probably a function of the cutting surface.
Often it is necessary to pull the core and/or some of the segments through the device by hand.
The white outer ring on ours has cracked where one of the blade "spokes" meets the ring.
It's still much faster than manually cutting apple slices, and probably safer.
Since we eat a lot of fruit around my house, this is an item that gets a real workout.
It is essentially used on a daily basis.This corer/divider is well designed and comfortable to use with its cushioned grips.
that your're processing on a regular basis for a healthier lifestyle.
The life you save may be your own!.
I wash all my veges and fruits with it.
Yep, I wash all my veges and fruit with it.
Did I say I was all my veges and fruits with it?  This brush is only dedicated for washing fruits and veges at my house.
I'm giving this brush 4 stars instead of 5 because its natural bristles don't last as long as I'd like.
I use it for everything from scrubbing produce (don't let anybody here tell you it won't scrub potatoes) to cleaning up pots, pans, and sinks.
The handle is comfortable and the brush is the perfect shape for a wide variety of kitchen tasks.
I start with a good spray of vinegar water and then scrub with this brush any dirt on the vegetables.
This tool makes cleaning/scrubbing of potatoes, squash, carrots very easy and you know that the vegies are clean.
I was having lots of trouble finding on in the stores, glad I found this one.
Nice size veggie brush with a handle that is easy to grip.
Oxo is a good brand, so I'm sure the quality is good.
I really like the back shape and feel to grip it.
This is a very stiff vegetable brush and I don't see how it would ever become flimsy in the future.
It fits comfortably in my hand and gets potatoes super clean.
We eat a lot of sweet potatoes in my house and this is a very handy tool in preparation for baking them.
I received this brush several years ago as a gift and it is still going strong.
I no longer use it for food cleaning, but for everything else in the home.
My son's puppy left his calling card on my carpet and this little brush came to the rescue.
It gets right in that spot between the floor and the porcelain at the bottom on the toilet.
You may call it a vegetable brush, but I call it my &#34;everything to clean&#34; brush.
It works well and has a good gripping surface.
What more can I say?  :-)  I'm glad I purchased it and absolutely recommend it.
Love it! Works great on many kinds of fruits and vegetables.
We probably go through 10-15 lbs a week.
This made cleaning potatoes the biggest dread in the kitchen.
I shopped vigorously online, read dozens of reviews, and finally decided on the OXO Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush.We've had it now for several months.
I no longer refuse to scrub my potatoes, so I don't think its stretching to say that this little brush has helped strengthen my relationship.
It really is fantastic, and I have nothing bad to say about it.
Totally worth the $8, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has to scrub vegetables.
Even if it eventually does flatten out on me, its already lasted at least 3x as long as any other brush I've tried.
This brush is easy to hold in the hand and the bristles are soft enough to clean vegetables such as potatoes and carrots.
This works great! I use it to clean our vegetables before I cook them and it definitely makes a noticeable difference!.
It is easy to hold and use and doesn't take up much room in your kitchen.
This brush works well on my potatoes and other vegetables that need to be brushed.
If you're cooking potatoes without skins, a good handwashing before you peel is all that's really necessary.
I like the skins though so I need to wash my potatoes more thoroughly.
This goes for all produce really but potatoes seem to be the dirtiest.
Now my only problem is figuring out a way to get my husband to eat the veggies!.
This helps a lot for cleaning potatoes that I buy that happen to be pretty dirty.
Mixed with any sort of veggie cleaning spray, it does wonders!.
Now if only it had a hook so I could hang it.
The "Oxo Good Grips 33781 Flexible Vegetable Brush" is the best vegetable brush I have been able to so far locate.
I give the product five stars but am still hoping to find a brush just a bit larger with even firmer bristles.
It still looks new! Also, for anyone with a physical challenge involving the hands, (like arthritis) the product is comfortable to use.
im a potato freak and eat one or two a day.
I used this to clean some carrots that I got from an organic farm deliver twice a monh.
Before this I just rinsed with cold water using my hands and the results were okay.
Then I tried the brush and there was no dirt left and it is good for my hands as I have arthritis.
This brush has many uses, not only for brushing vegetables.
I used it to scrub my wok, after it cooled down of course.
I'm an OXO fan to begin with so that's why I ordered this little brush.
It not only scrubs veggies well, it fits nicely into the palm of the hand.
It also has a non-slide surface that helps steady the brush for scrubbing.
It takes dark spots off radishes saving the time of using a knife to cut them out.
The bristles on this are  nice and sturdy.
My wife wanted a good, stiff, vegetable brush.She laughed, and laughed, when she got this in the mail for a Christmas present.
She says she could have gotten it at the local grocery store.But she loves it.
It is easy to clean and fits my hand perfectly.
Got it specifically to clean potatoes for T'giving.
Although I'd like a model of it that is a bit bigger, this fit in my hand fine AND it did a good job.
I suspect that it would work well on any veg or fruit.
Reasonably priced and seems to be of decent quality.
A quick hot rinse after each use and an occasional dishwashing keeps it in great shape.Unbeatable at this price.
one I use for vegetables and one I use for cast iron cleaning on occasion.
So far so good on both uses.The brush is durable.
ergonomic and fits nicely in your hand to do almost any job.
The brush is MUCH better quality than I had expected, what a pleasant surprise! You really can't beat the price for a brush this nice.
Just by the feel of it you can tell it will be extremely durable over the years and through many many uses.
All in all, WONDERFUL PURCHASE! I would very highly recommend this product to anyone in the market for a vegetable scrub brush!.
It scrubs, it hasn't fallen apart, it washes up really nice, it is comfortable in your hand to hold.
Long ago I had a Swedish veg brush that could make veg pristine with a few strokes.
This brush does just as well and has the added bonus of a very comfortable handle.
Easy to hold in my small hand and the bristles are still good after hundreds of potatoes.
This is exactly what I've been searching for the past several years.
It is stiff enough to clean dirty old potatoes and small enough to fit into my hand without slipping out.
This brush is exactly what I was looking for.
Cleans my fruits and vegetables well and grip on this thing is great for maintaining control!.
Just like the name, I can grip it firmly in my hand while I was brushing up apples, green peppers and stuff.
I have petite sized hands and this produce scrubber fits perfectly in my palm.
It could be better if the brush head was a bit larger.
the oxo good grips flexible vegitable brush is a great buy.
i ended up buying another i liked the brush so well.
it is easy to hold while washing any vegetable.
the brushes get right in and get out the dirt off potatoes as well as any vegitable.
Sure it fits into the center of a palm, but I think it's marketed to make a weakness sound like strength.
I'd like a bigger brush, ideally, with the same quality.
It fits the hand easily, scrubs the vegetables nicely and cleans up well.
Going to be throwing a number of these little gems into the stockings next Christmas!.
I use this brush at least three times a week and it still looks like new.
Just hard enough to clean vegetables especially potatoes without scratching the peel off.
This fits in your palm nicely and cleans without causing damage to lighter veggies such as mushrooms.
It is great for potatoes getting into all the little nooks and crannies.
A well equipped kitchen should have three veggie brushes including a firm bristle brush for old potatoes, and a soft bristle brush for mushrooms.
Many of us have small kitchens with limited drawer space and prefer to simplify when possible.
There is no all-purpose veggie brush but this one comes close.
It is perfect for most everything else, including the easy removal of silk from fresh corn.
Oxo always has quality products at a decent price, and this is no exception.
It fits perfectly in my hand, has bristles that are stiff enough to scrub off dirt but not so stiff that there's no flexibility.
It's easy to clean and a good price.
I've had it a while, and it still looks like new.
I took to eating the skins on potatoes etc and have meant for a decade to buy a veggie brush.
It looked easy to hold and the brush looked firm.
It works well, cleans potatoes & sweet potatoes, is comfy to grip, cleans with hot water.
This is a great brush for use on vegetables.
The bristles are stiff enough to scrape off dirt, but not as harsh as to damage.
The size is just right and fits in the hand well.
The rubber makes it comfortable and easy to grip without fatigue.
This brush is wonderful for cleaning produce like potatoes, carrots, and celery.
It's easy to grip and has a nice stiff brush.
An added bonus is that it is dishwasher safe, so I can place it in the dishwasher to keep it clean and looking nice.
The rubber handle is made of a material that doesn't slip in your hands when it gets wet.
This is a well-made brush that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand.
I'll definitely get more than my moneys worth from this brush.
I always used the long handled vegetable brushes.
My arthritis prevents me from scrubing the vegetable very hard, then I ran across this little scrubber from Amazon.
I LOVE IT!  It fits my hand perfectly and scrubs the vegetables so clean that I usually leave the peal on for the vitamins.
Thanks OXO for a wonderful product!Debra in Texas.
The bristles are very stiff, I find it hard to use on delicate mushrooms, but great for scrubbing a potato.
But, it's been going strong for two years and overall I recommend it.
As with most OXO products this brush is well made and the bristles are a perfect stiffness for scrubbing potatoes, etc.
Long story shirt, she loved it and bought her own.Great product!.
I glad I happened across it and got it.
When you are cleaning the tater you can see the difference between an uncleaned spot and a clean spot.
If your hands are bigger the brush should still be perfect.
If you are petite and have really small hands you may want to get a brush with a handle.
Very happy I bought this little brush for getting the wax covering off apples.
Also use it on pears and potatoes and carrots.
If fruit has gotten soft like ripe peaches, then it's a little too stiff, but the soft brushes won't really work on the hard stuff.
This is the best vegetable brush I've ever used!  My old one was really soft and barely got the dirt off of vegetables.
I bought this for $3.99 and the shipping on it was free, by itself.
It feels secure in your hand and it has done a good job so far.
I like the ergonomics of this product and I think others would as well.
SIMPLE, FUNCTIONAL, ATTRACTIVE -- LIKE MOST OXO PRODUCTS.
So happy I bought this! Since I'm pregnant, I'm being more vigilant about washing fruits and veggies before eating them.
The bristles are soft enough that I can wash everything from broccoli to potatoes to nectarines.
Highly recommended at this great price too! It is cheaper than Target, etc.
The Oxo Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush does just what it says.
It fits in the hand nicely and does a good job cleaning vegetables.
This seems to be a quality brush with a nice feel for gripping.
It has closely cropped and quite stiff bristles.
The size is right and it is very secure in your hand.Very comfortable to use.
This brush is well made...fits well in my hand...sturdy bristles and cleans very easy.
The OXY brand has once again stood up to its' reputation!!.
FITS YOUR HAND PERFECTLY!  DOES A GOOD JOB ON VEGIES.
THIS ITEM WOULD BE GREAT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE ARTHRITIS, VERY EASY TO GRIP.
These brush has nice, firm bristles that are great for brushing just about anything; fruits, veggies, potatoes, etc.
I love OXO, and I'm glad they didn't let me down with this one.
It fits very comfortably in my hand and makes scrubbing potatoes and other veggies very easy.
I wish I would have seen this a long time ago.
Now I plan to buy more for gifts and to have an extra for myself.
Not too soft nor too abrasive, just what I needed.
I bought this to use for cleaning dishes and light scrub on pans.
Nice ergonomic handle and soft but sturdy bristles.
Takes the grime off root vegetables very easily.
I hardly peel carrots anymore after a good cleaning with this brush.
this thing is worth every penny! I dont know how people could say they wish the bristles were stiffer.
large size of brush, makes it very easy to hold while cleaning vegetables.
bristles are not too stiff, nor too soft.
Recently I've been switching out a lot of the stuff in my kitchen with OXO brand versions.
Every time I try a new one out it just seems to work.
Given there is nothing revolutionary about a vegetable brush but this one just works well.
Its got an easy to grip surface, is ergonomic, and easy to clean.
In the end thats whats important and OXO delivers on that.
This brush is great for washing carrots, corn silk, and even more fragile berries because the bristles are so soft.
I use this brush to scrub my potatoes, apples, and vegetables (bell peppers, mostly) to get rid of dirt and pesticides.
I have had the brush several months and it is still going strong.
I leave it bristles-up so that they dry in between uses.
Very comfortable to use because of the soft rubber handle.
I will purchase a second if I ever lose this one or the bristles wear out.
This is a good vegetable brush, fits nicely in my hand, cleans the vegetables well.
I use it with a vegetable wash from The Honest Company.
I really like the way it fits in my hand and it scrubs the potatoes great!.
Oxo Good Grips Flexible Vegetable BrushA truly indispensable piece that every kitchen should have.
This more than just a vegetable brush, but it's intended use is better than others on the market.
The nylon bristles are strong and sturdy, dislodging dirt in deep nooks and crannies.
The Good Grips line features durable, nonslip flexible handles on every product.
As the days pass more and more uses seem to crop up for this little in hand cleaning tool.
This product is manufactured in China according to the specifications of the US patent.An epicurean Bon Appetite.
Never thought I'd be writing a review for a vegetable brush.
The fact that I am should illustrate how good this thing is, as is everything I own from OXO.
The grip feels nice in your hand and allows for easy motion, and the bristles are firm and don't wear out.
I use it to wash fruits and veggies all the time.
I'm reviewing this even though I never bought it, for some reason Amazon put it in my items to review.
I bought other OXO stuff and it is all good so this probably is too but what do I know.
It is a brush, probably brushes stuff, yee-haw!.
This is the best veggie brush I've ever owned.
It cuts scrubbing time in half, and it's held up very well (for 6 months).
I've used many vegetable brushes, mostly the horseshoe shaped with a handle, purchased from stores such as Sears,pennies, the ...marts, & kitchen stores.
I was skeptical of the positive reviews about this one.
I am impressed how well it fits in my hand & the ease & superior way it cleans.
I have had this brush for more than a year.
(Potatoes, carrots, etc)  I have used it to clean celery and wash fruit.
The bristles aren't soft but they are not stiff either.
And the sand and grit, the dirt all of this is gone without peeling.
This little brush added to my gustatory pleasure.
I got this brush to replace my vegetable brush that had a handle and was all plastic.
The OXO brush is easy to hold and I have much better control when scrubbing potatoes.
The bristles are much finer so that it removes more dirt and grit.
If you have to scrub/wash your vegetables, this is a wonderful brush and easy to handle.
Rubber handle doesn't slip out of your hand when wet.
It also cleans up well in the dishwasher so you don't have to worry about spreading germs.
I used it on potatoes and it worked great.
I am very glad I purchased this brush.
It fits nicely in my hand and gets the job done.
I purchased a bag of potatoes which turned out to be the dirtiest I have ever seen.
I generally appreciate OXOs thought into design, and this brush is no exception.
The size comes in handy when scrubbing potatoes, etc, it's much less &#34;handy crampy&#34; than my last one was.
Would buy again, would certainly recommend this for any cook getting older and having arthritis issues.
Cleaning veggies is not my favorite job, but this little brush makes it go quickly and does an efficient job.
This great little vegetable brush is sturdy yet flexible and cleans up great.
But i soaked it in Hydrogen Peroxide over night, and it was as brand new.
So now i know stain and grease can be removed from it.Recommend it, especially if you get veggies from farmers market often.
I have been cooking for a long time.
This is the absolute best little kitchen item I own.
It is without a doubt the best vegie brush ever.
It actually cleans the vegies and does it with little effort.I am planning on getting more to give to my kids and friendss.
My favorite scrub brush!  Great for scrubbing vegetables like potatoes.
I have also used it to brush out food from the intendations on Tupperware lids and the like.
But also, it really manages to clean vegetables.
I eat a lot of vegetables, and I use this a lot.
Wow!! What a Vege brush! This little brush has a comfortable feel.
The bristles conform to the shape of the potato, carrots, mushrooms or whatever vege you are cleaning no matter the shape or size.
It really goes to work without damaging the skin.
It cleans well and is also very easy to clean.
Worth more than the money spent for it!.
This is very easy to hold veggie brush.
It's not only comfortable and sturdy, but kind of cute, too!.
Perfect size to fit in the palm of your hand.
I've used it on potatoes, yams, cucumbers and celery.
The brush bristles are strong enough to clean and soft enough not to scrape the veggie.I have no complaints.
I bought it to qualify for a free S&H, and it works great.
Easy grip, stiff hair, but soft enough for any type of veggies from tomatoes to potatoes.
The brush is stiff, and is best used for fruits and vegetables with thick skin.
OXO is the best - high quality!  And because it is dishwasher safe - just fabulous!!!!  We use it on potatos and veges.
Works well and cleans up well in the dishwasher.
The whole Oxo good grip thing is probably a whole lot less important on a veggie brush than for some of the other kitchen tools.
Especially getting that extra dirt off of potatoes.
I will buy again when I need it.
I like this!  Cleans and does not damage skin.
Very sturdy brush makes cool water cleaning easy.
I haven't had bristles fall out or anything wrong with it.
It has strong bristles and is very easy to handle.
I purchased this after reading a review on a  cast iron grill pan that I purchased.
This works very well to remove on stuck on food from my grill pan and makes cleaning so much easier.
The bristels are tough enough to get food off, but has not scratched the non-stick of my grill pan.
I've been looking for a really good vegetable brush for awhile now and hip hip hooray I've found the perfect brush.
It has sturdy bristles, not to big, does the best job and fit perfectly in my palm.
I've purchased OXO brand items before and have been very happy with the items.
I can now say with full confidence that the vegetable brush can be added to the list of very dependable products.
It does an especially fine job on potatoes and lemons.
I'm so glad that I chose this particular vegetable brush.
Small price, yet as an OXO product, there is nothing cheap about it.
It's well designed, well manufactured, comfortable to hold in your hand, reasonably priced.
Just what I was looking for, just what I expected from OXO.
Is this the British company Oxo in London?.
I use this strictly in the washing of my vegetables and in the removal of silk from the ears of corn.
Fits in the hand so comfortably and works great.
I am going to get one for my daughter-in-law.
I've just received this today, March 28, 2009, and have already put it to good use cleaning potatoes while preparing to roast them.
As soon as I can test it with corn silk, or any other vegetable, I'll be updating this review.
Fits in the palm of your hand nicely.
It does a fine job on scrubbing vegetables.
This brush is easy to use as are most all Good Grips products, and does a nice job of brushing of surface dirt from veggies.
For items like potatoes, the bristles get into the little pockets here & there & clean them quite well.
I've purchased another & may yet get several more for Christmas stocking material.
If you want to scrub your fruit or veggies before eating them, this is the perfect brush for that.
I use this on a daily basis or nearly so.
It's a perfect fit for my hand and the bristles are stiff enough to do the job but not destructive.
I use this brush to clean all of my fruits and vegetables before I juice them.
It gets into all the crevices and cleans very well.
It is easy to hold onto and is very useful!.

Simple, works well, washable, fits in hand well.
What more can you say about a scrubber?.
This vegetable brush is extremely easy to handle, too.
Don't know how I lived without it until now.
I had been looking for a good vegetable brush for a long time.
Although this brush does not fulfill my definition of the &#34;perfect brush&#34;...it is excellent.
Just the right amount of bristle stiffness, right heft, fits my hand (and my wife's too) perfect.
I always expect quality stuff from Oxo, and they didn't let me down on this brush.
I always look for OXO before purchasing other brushes or kitchen items.
This brush is strong enough for a potato but soft enough for a tomato.
OXO makes a great product and you can't go wrong if you need a cleaning or kitchen product.
Amazon usually has free S&H and that's another plus.
I want my garden veggies to take the shortest route possible from garden to stove.
This brush helps me make short work of the cleaning part.
Works great, really good quality, I use it all the time and it gets my veggies super clean!  I would buy this again.
Its grip isn't terrible comfortable or uncomfortable, but it's a brush.
I also use it as a nail and hand brush, though it might be too harsh for folks with tender skin on their hands.
I bought two so my partner could help me clean veggies!  I do a big wash once a week after a trip to the store.
I liked this brush so much I just ordered my second.
Not sure why I have not had one of these before, but it makes things a heck of lot easier when I am cleaning carrots!.
From reading the description, I was thinking this brush was soft and floppy.
It is molded to fit easily and naturally in the palm of a hand, and is very easy to hold, even when wet.
Plus, it feels more expensive than it is, which is always nice!.
It fits great in your hand and works great.
Good job Oxo!  Great job on Amazon too for fast shipping.
I have used this vegetable brush for just over a year, and it still looks brand new.
The bristles have not bent or fallen out.
It fits into the hand nicely, and is easy to use.
The bristles are stiff enough to take care of business, but not so stiff that they rip up the skins on the vegetables.
Because the bristles are not harsh, I also use the brush on my hands to clean off ground-in dirt or paint.
Best of all, I can pop it into the dishwasher and restore it to germ-free cleanliness.
We wash all our fruit with this brush, and it's great.
Soft enough that it doesn't do damage, but firm enough that the fruit is visibly free of any dirt, dust, or wax.
The brush gets into the crannies, say around the stem of an apple.
Got this veggie brush to fill out an order.
Washes out clean, bristles are firm but not scratchy.
We find it perfect for cleaning veggies including potatoes.
Love how it fits in the palm of your hand.
And without a handle it takes little space for storage.
Fits in the hand nicely, big enough size to cover a lot of area fast and looks like it should last for decades!.
I have been ordering and using this for years.
Its look is simple yet it is very versatile.
I use it to clean fruits and vegetables, such as apple, orange, pear, peppers, celery.
It can also be used things around bathroom, for example, it effectively remove calluses from pumice stone.
I regularly sanitize these brushes, they really last very long.
The bristles stay stiff for quite a long time before getting softened a bit.
Its a vegetable brush, what can you say, it works.
The reason for only four stars is unlike other Oxo Good Grips, this is a bit small to hold tightly.
This is the best veggie scrubber I ever bought.
The handle is easy to hold and the bristles are stiff.
You can easily scrub all the dirt off of a potato and by using light pressure it also works well for delicate vegetables like mushrooms.
I also like it because when I feel like it needs a deep cleaning I just throw it in the dishwasher (which also kills bacteria).
I have had it for a couple of months and it is still in great shape.
When I do need a new one I will buy this exact same one again.
This is exactly what I wanted for a veggie brush.
This is yet another great Oxo product - I haven't met an oxo gadget I didn't like.
so far! This scrubber is easy to hold and makes quick work of cleaning potatoes.
It definitely takes the dirt off quickly and easily.
Cleaning vegetables is a chore that is a necessary evil.
That was several years ago and since then I've collected several.
It works but I prefer a brush with stiffer bristles (which I have so no big deal).
I've owned this for close to a year and it looks like new.
I have no doubt that it will hold up well through the years.
This works great so far, it works great and is easier to clean than i though it would be! i highly suggest this !!.
I've used other vegetable brushes that work equally well and feel equally comfortable in my hand.
The bristles also seem stiffer and haven't showed any signs of wearing down like an old toothbrush.
The bristles are STILL stiff, and that's with a lot of use over the past year.
The bristles are just the right length and unlike other brushes I've used before, they don't flatten out.
The shape is ergonomically perfect, at least for me and much easier to use than those with handles.
Morever, whether it's because of the bristles or that I'm able to grip it really well, potatoes get REALLY clean.
I've even used it on tomatoes (don't exert a lot of pressure), celery, grapefruit, oranges, turnips, parsnips, and carrots.
I'm even thinking of getting another one to use for pots and pans - to get baked-on goo off.
This is a product that's both reasonably priced and does exactly what it's supposed to do.
It fits perfectly in the palm of my hand, very comfortable to grip.
Does it's job perfectly, couldn't ask for better.
The rubber grip remains easy to hold, even when wet.
The brush is a little pricey, but it is very well designed, and feels great in your hand.
This works as advertised (would be hard to fail).
The only notable thing is that I got a different model.
It isn't completely round with the low profile, mine is oblong and seems to be about twice as tall as the one in the photo.
Good quality and it has held together for about 2 months now without coming apart.
I use it for scrubbing "stuff" rather than for scrubbing vegetables because the bristles are a bit stiffer than expected.
Still, I like the price and that amazon prime convenience.
Fits nicely in your palm.I much prefer these of brushes that have a long handle.
This gives you much more control to brush fruits and vegetables.
Works great for crepes....at least my husband, the cook in the family says so.
When our first one broke (after years of use) he requested another one.
Here's a tip:  spray the spatula with Pam, then wipe it with a paper towel.
Rewipe every dozen cookies.Between this spatula, cookie scoop and my airbake cookie sheets, I feel like a real cookie pro.
Cookies practically levitate off the sheet and onto the cooling rack.
The gooey melty ones don't even stick--if you spray the spatula first.Take care.
This spatula is very thin and you must treat it like a lady.
It is not for flipping pancakes or burgers.
Store it by hanging it from the handle if you can and wash it by hand.
I bought this because it was recommended by Cooks Illustrated.
It is very thin and can get under anything.
But you have to get used to how it works.
The first time or two, take your time.
I was a little surprised at how flexible this spatula really is.
I have used it for a few months and it has been good and handy.
Sadly, I needed to replace a very flexible spring steel turner that had age-hardened and cracked.
I use cast iron, while others in the family use non-stick, and I needed two different turners.
I looked for them at various places, and was very disapointed at the selection: all were too thick and not at all flexible.
Amazon to the rescue!  They had the OXO Good Grips listed as a "large flexible turner".
I bought the stainless version for the cast iron pans, and a silicone over stainless version for the non stick.The stainless version is fantastic.
First, it is large enough to flip large pancakes without tearing them.
Third, the blade is very genty curved in a manner that causes it to be stiff when it is needed.
Oh, and fourth, the handle, as on all OXO products, is, well, just right.
How do they do that?When I first held it in my hand, I thought the blade would be too large for flipping a fried egg.
It is more "mid-size" than the larger model I just described.
This is yet another item I bought based on a recommendation from Cooks Illustrated.
In the interest of full disclosure I have to admit that I've only used it for removing cookies so far but it has performed great.
It was a purchase that I don't have any regrets about making and I recommend it to anybody looking for a good dependable spatula.
This is the spatula you've been looking for!  It is very thin and extremely flexible.
I just finished using it for a batch of chocolate chip cookies and it is incredible.
I had picked one of these ones up from TJ maxx one time and gave it away then couldnt find it anywhwere.
It is perfect for flipping fish, over medium or over easy eggs and delicate desserts/ fresh baked cookies.
nice longhandle makes it good for grilling fish and not burning your hand.
Defintely reccomend to anyone who is a lover of kitchen gadgets and tools or bakes a lot.
I use it all the time and it never disappoints.Edit: 12/9/12I  bought two more of these recently.
I am so spoiled by these that I rarely use a "normal" spatula anymore.
A huge argument ensued over the misuse of my beloved spatula, so to save our marriage, I bought 2 more for me.
The one my husband uses has survived very well, but recently one of the rivets holding one side of the blade to the handle broke.
It still works, imagine that, even with the extreme heat and weight demands.
Good thing I have a spare one for when his finally breaks!.
It is thin, flexible and wide enough for anything.
Use it literally every day making eggs for breakfast.
It is very easy to slip under over easy eggs with out breaking them.
Holds a lot of weight for such a slim design.
Would recommend and would by again if needed.
This is nice and thin and works great.
The resulting stiffness gives the blade enough rigidity to pick up hambergers but is flexible enough to slide under cookies and pancakes.
Although it is lightweight, it is everything I was looking for and everything CI said it was.
This spatula is incredible for cookies, and most likely for getting under fried eggs as well.
The super thin blade slides under cookies with amazing ease, and I wish I'd discovered this spatula years ago if only for cookies.
I wouldn't throw it carelessly around in drawers, for example.
I had an older version of this spatula that broke after many years of use.
I love the thinness of this spatula for easily slipping undera variety of baked goods.
I could not do without one of these in my kitchen.
Use it for cookies only and you will be thrilled.
I bought this spatula to use with my cast iron skillet.
It does a really great job for foods like fried eggs and bacon and smaller items.
Easily scrapes burnt-on bits off the pan and slides under foods easily.
Some have written that this is too flexible.
This type of flexible spatula take a few spins to get used to.
Just got it, so am just hoping the weld will last a reasonable time.
I had the last one for almost 8 years, before the weld wore out.
Once I bought my first flexible stainless spatula I literally threw all my other spatulas out.
The thin blade makes this a really versatile piece of equipment.
I use it for lifting, scraping, scooping and even slicing.
The  best feature on this particular model is the handle.
It's comfortable AND  you can lean the spatula against a hot pan without fear that the handle  will get too hot.
America's Test Kitchen told me exactly what to expect here, and I got just that.
Great for everything except anything heavy - which I don't encounter too often in the frying pan.
Don't expect it to be a lifter or server.
It's awesome for pancakes, eggs, French toast, etc.
I've never used anything that gets under food as easy.
I bought this for friend who likes to make omelets and was have hard time flipping them in small skillet.
It has made what was frustrating a joy.
This is perfect for getting under things in the fry pan, like eggs, and flipping them.
I also use it when baking bread to go between the pan and the bread and loosen it on the sides and underneath.
It is very flexible but yet sturdy enough to flip most things.I am now on my second one of these.
I *thought* I only had the first one maybe 2 years.
And if that was it - I would still rate it 5 stars.
I use this many many times per week and two years worth of work for $8 is a bargain.
So - Basically I paid a little over $1 per year to use this a ton for things only it can do.
Tempted to buy 5 more and store them away in case they stop making them 7 years from now.
I had been looking for a flexible spatula, but they are hard to find.
This works great on fish and also had good luck turning fried eggs.
I like the thinness too, because it's great for getting under cookies for quick removal from the pan.
Buy a COUPLE of these things, tools this nice grow legs.
A good spatula is a nice tool -- makes your life easier and better.
It's a basic steel spatula, very good for cookies, fish, etc.
I had been looking for a while since my old one broke.
The edge is thin enough to get underneath the cookie.
It slides under the stickiest of sticky-buns, pies, and eggs are lifted out perfectly without breaking the yolks under the &#34;sunny-side&#34;.
I'm going to order more of these as gifts.
This is a very flexible spatula so isn't suited to general use but  when you need one like this it is wonderful.
The only reason I don't give it 5stars is that this is my 3rd one.
I was so pleased with this spatula that I ordered a second one as a gift.
It's great for turning softer items such as eggs.
This flexible turner is exactly what I needed!  I wanted something that would slide under hot cookies easily.
It does NOT garble up the bottom of my cookies.
Which is perfect for flipping eggs and not breaking the yolks when lifting out of the pan.
This review is basically a copy from the review I wrote for the smaller version of this spatula.
They are essentially the same product with slightly different blade sizes.
I hope this is OK.This spatula (and it's slightly smaller brother) replaces my Oxo SteeL spatula for pancakes and eggs.
I'm pretty new in the kitchen so I'm just learning what works for me and what doesn't.The SteeL product line is nice.
I don't have a bad thing to say about them.
In particular the SteeL spatula is pretty heavy duty and well built.
The blade feels kind of flimsy and is very thin.
It bends easily and if you are too rough with it I believe it would permanently crease without much effort.
This is a super tool for getting under and lifting food, especially if it's stuck.
I looked a long time for this style.
I came across this item somewhere and have since purchased one for each of my children and my daughter's mother-in-law.
Not good for turning heavier foods, but absolutely the best for cookies or pancakes.
Anything by oxo is amazing they are such a good high quality utensil.
Once you buy one product you will want them all.
I must say that when I first received the turner, I thought it to be so flimsy.
But when I used it, I found out why it was that way.
I took cookies off of the baking pan with ease...and I turned the pancakes perfectly!  Love this turner!!.
Flips eggs without moving them around the pan.
The only problem is it is so thin and hard to put in the drawer without ruining it.
This is a well made product as I have found of all the OXO Good Grip products I have bought.
It is especially great for flipping eggs and smaller pancakes as It is so thin it easily slips underneath, without making a mess.
I bought this spatula on the nice write-up by America's test kitchen.
I had a few plastic ones that were really getting on my nerves.
They would stick to eggs when you tried to turn them over, causing as mess.
I bought this spatula after going through a few plastic ones that melted, wouldn't get clean, and just didn't work that great.
This works like a charm and flips stuff real easy.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it can be pretty hard to get little bits of food off.
This product is wonderful for scrambled eggs and other light and soft items.
Trying to use it to lift and flip heavier items is a challenge because the material of the spatula is so thin and flexible.
For grilled sandwiches I have to use one of my sturdy plastic spatulas or else spill the contents of my sandwich.
If this is going to be your only spatula, I would recommend looking at something else.
If you intend it to round out your kitchen utensil collection, then it is great!.
I replaced a thicker silicone 'flipper' with this one and its smaller version.
They are strong enough and work better, plus they are thin enough to get underneath the food.
This turner is very good for turning food in a skillet.
I used it turn some sticky carmelized onions and it handled the batch very well.
It also cleaned up the edge of the plastic turner I was using.
I am going to try it on some more items in the near future.
This spatula is exactly what I've been trying to find.
Since I generally eat food made from actual food, and not bricks, this works for my kitchen.
This spatula has become a favorite tool in my kitchen.
The metal is thin, but has enough curve so that it won't flop or bend.
I purchased this (based on Cook's Illustrated comparison of similar products).
The &#34;blade&#34; portion of this turner is very, very flexible (in on direction) but will hold quite a load.
Nice and thin and will get under just about anything - great for cookies!.
Got this to replace my thin spatula that is slowly disintegrating.
It's not as good as my beloved utensil, but it works.
The blade is very thin and slips under eggs perfectly.
The only complaint I have is that the blade is uniformly thin.
My old spatula has a thin edge then the blade slowly widens, providing support.
This OXO spatula is not as stable, flexes easily and can snap, sending food flying unexpectedly.
It takes some getting used to, but I have found it to be a suitable replacement for a utensil no longer available.
This spatula is the first one I reach for now when I am cooking.
Not sure if I will ever need to use the stiff ones again!.
This turner works real well in mt cast iron and is easy to clean and very flexible love this buy.
Being so thin it's amazing how well it handles.
These two features make for a really great design.
This is a fantastic kitchen tool for mashing vegetables.
The masher is well constructed and feels like it will last a long time.
This is a good product with a nice handle.
Its easy to use and it does the job of mashing foods well.
I always hated all the other mashers and how you had to hold them.
vertical it is easier to mash with less effort.
The only thing I would change on it would be to have the distance between the handle and the masher end farther apart.
Making mashed potatoes for a family of 8 my fingers would dip into the hot potatoes every once and a while.
Like most OXO products that I have used it seems to be fairly well made.
This is a quick and easy way to have mashed potatoes without whipping out the hand mixer.
You control the lumps and general texture.First, this is easy to use.
Unlike a vertical masher, the OXO has an easy grip handle which is comfortable to use and requires far less &#34;muscle&#34;.
I like the fact that I have more control over the texture of my mashed potatoes.
I like basic mashed potatoes that are on the lumpy side and the control you have using this masher will produce the perfect lumps.
However, when I make my holiday mashers with cream cheese I can go as creamy as I want.
Additionally, it is well made like all OXO products.
It's not easy to find good mashers, but I don't need to look further since I found this gem.
This masher has pretty short handles but works perfectly by putting your weight over the item being mashed.
Was opting for the Jamie Oliver Potato Masher but this one works just great.
Finally I can make mashed potatoes without using my mixer.
I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 for thos who care) and I can use this tool.
Traditional potato mashers just require more grip than I have in my hand.
Works great, just as a potato masher should.
I use it for mashing ripe fruit, too, for canning purposes.
I use a ricer for mashed potatoes, but this masher is fabulous for making refried beans.
The type of masher with wavy tines just doesn't do as good a job.
My friends in Mexico tried to steal it from me, so I bought a few as gifts :D.
Bought this for my daughter - who has managed to destroy 2 other potato mashers - didn't even ask how.
Know OXO makes a good tool so  I thought she could try this one.
I was able to mash 7 large potatoes into creamy perfection within 10 seconds.
I've never been able to do that before.
Better than even a food processor.The handle is shorter than most mashers, allowing superior leverage.
Plus, the size and design of the mashing head allows the potatoes to freely squish through the masher, making it easier and not allowing overmashing.
Solidly constructed of heavy stainless steel with rivets connecting the masher to the handle.
Its size and heft make it sitable for other purposed too.
When deep frying and a piece won't stay turned over for uniform cooking, this masher will keep your meat submerged for uniform browning.
After asking around I was recommended this style and it works so much better.
The pattern ensures an even mash and the handle makes it easy to use.
Easy, cause of the design, it's real easy to mash.
does a fine job, and you don't have to drag out the electric mixer.
The longer handle also allows you to avoid getting potatoes all over your hands while mashing.
The handle is also great quality and I'm able to maintain a constant, firm grip.
The design staff at OXO really have it together.
It's sturdily built, has a beautiful finish, and seems to have the perfect size and shape to mash the most potatoes with the least effort.
Besides, it looks great, and that doesn't hurt when it's off duty.
Does a good job without a lot of effort.
I prefer this type of handle for a potato masher to the sideways ones.
I wish the sides were a thicker metal, but I think it will stand up to the test of time, it seems pretty heavy-duty.
I have always used a vertical potato masher, and I am not the biggest fan of this one where you have to push down.
You cannot go as fast and because the holes are so small, you can't make lumpy mashed potatoes.
This is fine with my, but my girlfriend is not a fan.
Overall it works, but I wouldn't buy it again.
Thank goodness for a good heavy duty masher that doesn't bend or mash properly.
I will be mashing more than just spuds.
The grip is easy on your hand, and clean-up is a snap.I couldn't be more pleased.
I can't believe that I am so excited about such a simple kitchen tool.
And this masher more than meets my expectations.
Worth every cubic inch of storage.This is The One to buy.
Sturdy, comfortable to use, economy of motion and easy to clean.
In fact - the plus-es of this more than made up for it's sole shortcoming.
However, I would still choose this one over that other model because there was no hand fatigue with the Oxo.
My family loves mashed potatoes and when I make them I make a lot.
This was definitely put through some trials for Thanksgiving.
I'm looking forward to using it for Christmas, and for meals in between.
This makes the smoothest mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, squash ever.
Can't wait to mash baby food with it.
Decided to get this item instead of a potato ricer and I am not disappointed.
I wish it was a bit more heavyweight but it gets the job done.
This tool is very well made, easy to clean and easy to hold.
I steam and boil large amounts of veggis and keep them in the fridg.
until I heat them up and add them as a side for my meals.
I've been searching for a good masher that would shmush them up completely but still leaves some texture.
I use this masher at least three times a week and it does a great job.
Yep, it's much better than the useless curved style that I used to have.
The handle is nice, easy to grip and is easy on the wrist.
I used to make refried beans by mashing them with a fork.
It's much more thorough than mashing with a fork, as well, resulting in fewer large chunks and a smoother texture.
It also works quite well for mashing potatoes and sweet potatoes (even if I put a little garlic in).
Unlike one of the negative reviewers, there was nothing that came loose on mine, even with repeated use.
I have not been able to use it yet.
I bought it because I needed one for my kitchen.
I had no problems turning potatoes into creamy mashers with ease.
If anyone has problems with "lumps" with this, it simply means that you are not cooking your potatoes long enough before trying to mash them.
The shape of this works well also as you can get to the edge of the pot easily.
Have used this for over 2 years and it is just like new after many uses and washings.
This is a great example of the best of kitchen tools.
Buy it now, trust me you DO need it.
I have used it on potatoes (all root veggies actually) as well as things like apples cooked for apple sauce.
It is easy to use with a comfy grip.That said..i still feel like i need a ricer.
I think this is a great buy if this is all you will need.
If you will ultimately need a ricer anyway...consider getting that first and than see if you still need this.
The horizontal handle makes it easier to mash potatoes or bananas than the traditional kind.
There is a small gap in the welds on the sides by the masher that catch some food particles but they clean easily.
The compact size also fits better in a gadget drawer.
My preschool age children can also use this with relative ease when helping with food prep.
This masher does! Spray it with a little non-stick spray, mash a few time, and yum.
This is definitely the tool to mash potatoes by hand.
I avoided making mashed potatoes before I learned about this type of masher, now I make them frequently.
It's small price to pay for a tool that really works.
This is the potato masher I have been looking for!  I use it instead of my mixer.
This was a gift requested by college student.
Sturdy design like most OXO products, OXO is becoming my go-to supplier to replace kitchen tools I lost in a fire a couple years ago.
We like this covered ice cube tray because it keeps the cubes from getting &#34;fuzzy&#34; in our refrigerator freezer.
Like it so much we purchased a second one.
I needed some sort of ice cube tray that would be usable in a travel trailer and be easy to remove ice cubes.
The cover minimizes spills while freezing and it also enables loosening the cubes without them going everywhere.
I haven't had any problems with this ice cube tray.
I do tend to only fill mine about 3/4 of the way full so as the water freezes, there is somewhere for it to go.
I've always trusted OXO and even used to work in Kitchen appliances so I know they've got a great reputation.
I used this tray to make baby food in and I bought more because of how awesome these trays are.
They are super easy to clean and they cubes pop out so easily.
I had none of the issues with not being able to slide the lid and can only assume those who did must have really overfilled.
The ice tray is easy to use, opens easily, and the cube size allows for quick freezing.
I have listed what I consider pros and cons below.
I love the size of the cubes but it is inconvenient to have to stop and slide the tops back.
Great icecube tray, BPA free (Amazon should clearly mention this in the listing).
I love the cover, and I'll probably be getting another one soon.
Sliding cover is designed to let you dispense cubes one at a time.
I started filling the tray only halfway to get smaller cubes.
This ice tray is easily released and easy to handle because of the cover.
Only draw back is the cube is a bit smaller.
Not a problem really but just know that is the case.
I am glad I bought but a  bit pricey for sure.
haven't used long enough to know how soon the plastic will crack..hope not soon.
I like the weight of the trays and the shape of the cubes and am really enjoying having the covers.
Don't have to worry about stacking the trays and spilling.
The lid is easy to get on and off, and definitely keeps the dust out of our ice.
This ice cube tray with cover is wonderful for freezing fresh herbs.
The cover  allows me to place it in the freezer without worrying that something will spill it or drop into it.
I have an automatic ice maker in the freezer, so making ice isn't a typical necessity unless I want large cubes.
For that purpose, I have silicone trays in two sizes.
These are more sturdy than any other trays I've seen and the lids slide on and off pretty comfortably.
It is not a slippery slide, so I'm not concerned about much leakage if they are not placed in the freezer in a perfect position.
I most recently used them for freezing the whey from a yogurt cheesemaking endeavor and had no problem.
I filled both trays and had a little left over which I put in a 2 ounce paper cup.
I've had these trays for years and they still look as good as the day of purchase.
For baby food or pureed food for the elderly or infirm, these can aid in preparing and storing small portions.
If you use the technique of freezing and then placing the sections in another container or bag, you're ready.
I've also frozen fresh herbs in water for use in soups.
So far so good with these ice trays.
the cover is great , the cubes come out easy.
I stack these five high in my freezer.
Got this tray because it slid in a case.
So if I wanted to take it with me, the cubes would not get messy or I had to put it in a baggy.
Another feature is the water did not spill on my floor after filling it.
Getting the tray out was a bit of a challenge, but I ran it under hot water and it came right out.
These are really great trays ( I bought 2) they stack well and they're easy to remove.
I don't think you can go wrong with these trays.
I like the ice cube tray because of its cover.
But don't be deceived, it's not an airtight seal.
They come out immediately and easily with no trouble.
Easy to fillEasy to release iceand tucks neatly underor on top of whatever is in the freezer.
I bought these trays to use when I have too much spinach or kale.
You can grind it up with a little water in a ninja and then put in trays and freeze.
You can then throw the frozen kale into your Ninja when making a breakfast drink.
They are very well made and the lid slides back and forth so you can just take out a few without dumping the whole tray.
The ice &#34;cubes&#34; are also easy to extract due to their circularly shaped bottoms.
The lidkeeps odors out, avoids ice evaporation, and allows you to stack other items on top of the tray.
I bought these to use as molds for the fresh baby food I make then freeze for my daughters meals.
The molds are so amazing because the frozen food just slides out and makes storage a snap.
I have a couple of Eco Vessel water bottles that other ice cubes require chiseling with an ice pick in order to use.
These half-moon shaped chunks of ice fit perfectly through the opening of the water bottles.
Love them - love that I can stack then in the freezer and that easy to break before taking off lid to dump into bin.
I use these to freeze a special supplement, I make up for my cats.
I've bought 4 because they keep the meat fresh and clean for 2+ weeks.
Camelina Oil, then pour into - 2 Oxo Good Grips Ice Cube Trays.
Great for controlling feline herpes and their coats are amazing!.
We have an ice maker for our regular ice.
I use this to make coffee ice cubes with coffee that is left over when I make a full pot.
It keeps the coffee from spilling in our very packed freezer.
These are simply the best ice cube trays ever.
I will never buy any other ice cube tray.
The blade is wide enough to open the shells.
The grip is very good, doesn't slip at all even when wet.
Wish the tip was a bit thinner so it's easier to get it inside the oyster.
You should definitely also get a pair of protective gloves with this.
Solid build, non-slip handle, and thick enough blade to open even the hardest ones.Love this product.
So, my friends decided to have a oyster party, which means shucking oyster after oyster without getting shells in the delicious delicacy.
This knife has successfully shucked 48 oysters on two separate occasions.
It could be a little sharper for dislodging the oyster from the shell after you've opened it.
I bought this when I learned how much cheaper it was to buy oysters from the fish market than from a restaurant.
This does a pretty good job opening them.
Before I got this knife, they were using my butter knives to open shells, hence the bent ends.
Now I have straight knives again and everyone is happy, munching their oysters.
I have solo shucked many dozen's of holiday oysters in my day and know my way around a shucking knife.
Of the several I own, this is my second favorite.
Oxo is generally a reliable kitchen accessory manufacturer and for occasional use, it's not too shabby.
I do prefer a heftier blade, the Oxo is pretty bent up, but it does work.
I believe that this works just as well as the far more expensive oyster knives.
Before I found this gadget life for me was different.
I would cut corners like skip the deveining (yuck, I can't believe I did that!) unless the shrimp or vein was pretty large.
Everyone who has ever eaten shrimp knows how tedious shelling is.
In one small swoop the vein and shell is gone, leaving only the tip of the tail.
I have two houses and needed a spare for peel and eat shrimp.
I have a metal peeler, but OXO glides thru the back and make quick work of several dozen shrimp.
Get this one! It's really for foodies and cooks.
This works well for cleaning shrimp, as advertised.
I've cleaned 6-7 lbs of large shrimp so far and this makes it quick and easy.
A metal blade would probably lead to more mangled shrimp so it's just fine.
I'm quite satisfied with the item and would have no issues recommending it to anyone.
just stab the shrimp where it's head used to be and pull up, out comes the intestinal tract, really easy.
I used to work at Red Lobster and peeled and deveined LOTS of shrimp and this style is the best I&#8217;ve used.
I had one of these for years and somehow lost it.
I had to look hard to find this style of peeler/deveiner but wouldn&#8217;t settle for any other kind.
If you're preparing shrimp and hate deveining them, this is the tool to get.
This tool does just that, and ergonomically fits your hand.
This OXO product is easy to use and because of the large soft handle, easy to hold.
Slip off the shell with legs attached from the bottom and voila...shelled shrimp.
I think this is helpful when you master using it...which can take a bit of time if your used to using a knife.
Having always used just a paring knife to cut and de-vein getting the hang of this was a bit of a struggle.
I thought, being a bit of a foodie, I &quot;needed&quot; this.
So since it doesn't take up much space and isn't expensive I think this was a good purchase.That said.
We had crab tonight, and these seafood picks work really well.
The crabs have all the chambers at the connection between leg and body and the picks easily scooped out the meat.
The sharp two prong end is perfect for grabbing hard to reach bits of seafood.
These are a good design because they do not slip.
The only issue is they are not the most beautiful picks in the world and probably won't look good on a fancy table.
You shouldn't have to give up looks for good design.
If you are a serious hot shellfish eater, these are highly recommended for digging out meat and then dipping into broth and butter.
They fit the hand wonderfully unlike plain seafood forks.
My wife still likes to use a narrow pick for getting meat out of the skinny legs of crabs and lobsters.
Quite a bit bigger than I expected, so if you will use more for nuts they may not work as well for delicate work.
These will be really nice with crab legs and lobster, so I am still very happy with the purchase.
Just be sure to check the dimensions if you've never seen them in the store.
They are nice looking, and really come in handy when eating crab legs.
Not going to feel sorry if you buy these.
The steel finish on these picks are not matte (like in the photos) but shiny more like chrome.
Cosmetically, over time they get scratched up when used to get into the nooks and crannies of hardshell crab.
OXO is gradually filing in every possible kitchen gadget niche.
This is a real crab fork (forget those stupid cocktail forks, they don't go up inside crab legs).
If I hadn't lost it I could give a better comparison.
Never had an issue with our 1st, so we ordered another one for the kids bathroom.
The replaceable head is nice and the flexible neck makes getting under the rim a breeze.
I got tired of buying...and replacing...the cheaper toilet brushes.
I spent the money on three of these for each bathroom and really like them.
They are solid, no flexing or breaking and do a great job of really scouring the toilet bowl to ensure a thorough cleaning.
I bought these probably close to a year ago and they are still as solid as the day I got them.
I ordered two of these brushes based on previous good experience with OXO products.
They came in today packaged in nothing more than soft plastic sleeves.
Now it appears the problem is inadequate protection during shipment.
In the meantime they are both in place so we'll give them a test and see if they too live up to the OXO name.
I gave it four stars just because of the OXO name and will update if anything notable occurs.
bought to replace an over ten year old oxo toilet brush/canister.
am pleased that I can just replace the brush head portion on this.
I can't say this cleans any better than an old fashioned, hole in the middle brush.
It looks nicer and seems as though it will last longer, nice that the brush is replaceable.
Looks nice sitting there and is very effective.
My last one had a metal handle and it became way too easy for the metal to scratch the bottom of the bowl.
This new one has a nice big brush that does the job.
I rinse it out a bit in the sink first and then put it back.
Hardly, if any, water sits at the bottom.
I bought a replacement head so it's nice to have that on hand but won't be changing it for quite a while I'm sure.
You hardly have to bend over to use it's automatic flap open when you pull or flap closed when putting it home.
It would be very cool in brushed nickel, bronze or stainless.
This is a VERY good buy! I bought 3 and now I'm ordering two more.
If you do prefer to generate rust, put it back wet & let tepid, gross water collect at the bottom of the canister.
That can then be dumped out as it will collect at the bottom (simple physics of gravity) That's going to happen easily with any apparatus.
My  toilet brushes have held up fine for 2.5 years & counting.
It's all a matter of usage and taking care of things, right???.
Comes direct from Amazon and quality seems to be good.
I've used it for over a year, so I know for sure that it's pretty durable.
And it has an attractive look about it.So I can recommend this, but it's with one reservation.
Oxo has a compact version that sells for $7 less.
When I decide to get another brush for a second bathroom, that's the model I expect to get.
have had before and buying more for other sites, love the quality, look, ease of use of these products, happy.
These OXO good grips line have really been a godsend.
They have made cleaning up nasty dishes a million times easier.The soap dispensing handles are solid and easy to use.
The buttons to dispense the soap are in easy to reach places and they hold enough for about a month's worth of cleaning.
Refilling takes about 30 seconds and is usually done without spilling a drop.
I am pretty rough on them when cleaning our cast iron grill and they still last about 6 months before giving in.
Changing them takes about 30 seconds as well.Really ingenious product.
I use this scrubber daily for everything from plates, to pans, to glasses.
It easily dispenses soap and scrubs tough-to-clean substances.
They get stuck in there for days which is pretty gross.
This is the best dish brush I have ever used.
It is effective at cleaning and easy to keep clean.
The soap dispensing portion of the brush has lasted me over 5 years and it it used many times a day.
The top finally broke and I will gladly purchase another...it can't be beat!  I'm very happy it is still available.
Small, handy, useful in practice, easier to grip than &#34;handled&#34; brushes, and discreet when sitting on the backsplash.
And the brush design doesn't clot up with dirt like some others.
You don't have to use the soap-dispenser function, and it's still worthwhile.
Plus, the brush element is replaceable, like every six months or so.
I'll preface by saying I didn't by this oxo palm brush on Amazon, but at Target.
It is an amazing, solidly designed little gem that doesn't leak soap like some other brands and shoots a little squirt of soap on command.
It actually makes washing dishes a little fun.
In fact, most jobs that were once difficult are now fun because of this little brush.
I have used this for years but previously got it at Williams Sonoma.
Found it on Amazon for cheaper! Better than a sponge because it doesn't hold germs.
I bought this hoping it would save my nails when washing certain items that needed harder scrubbing than a dishcloth can do.
It fits in my hand easily and does the exact job I need it to do.
All in all, I am happy with this item.
Can't commend on durability yet, but it has worked well for my needs since I received it a week ago.
I have gained a respect for OXO products.
You may want to order a couple replement brushes.
It's not a design fault, they just wear out over time.
The integrated soap dispenser makes this small, inexpensive brush a very helpful addition to kitchen sink gear.
Used one of these at a beach house and just had to have it.
It works great and I run the brush through the dishwasher about once a week to keep it clean.
This is our second one, and it appears that it will last much longer.
Not only that, but the brushes are replaceable.
I like OXO's product innovation! The soap reservoir on this one is larger also.
Go easy on the push dispenser, soap comes out faster with this one.
They last reasonably well for the work they do.
I had one, ordered another plus replacement bristles.
The product arrived fast, just as ordered, I would recommend this anyone and would definitely order again.
It is so easy to clean frying pans and pots with this without having to have your hands into the  grease and grime.
It will do a decent job or stuck surfaces.
It isn't a scouring pad but it takes care of normal pans with panache.It is FAR easier to keep hygienic.
I first got the plastic scouring pad version of this dispenser/tool.
It also won't wear nearly as well as this unit.
The pads are softer and wear and lack this ones aggression.I am very happy with this unit.
It is better working than the normal tools we use on pans or dried dinnerware.
This product works well on plates and other flat type surfaces.
However, I have a hard time using it in glasses.
The bristles do not bend well to clean the sides.
I do like the push to dispense detergent feature.
This is the perfect cleaning utensil for little job, or pre-rinsing dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.
For tougher jobs, you will still need a sponge with a scrubbing side, but this works well for smaller, less though jobs.
We've been using this Oxo Brush for a several years now and use it just about every day.
It sits on our sink tray and saves on soap and water.
The refills keep it looking like new and are relatively inexpensive.
Friends who have seen us use this brush always want one so I give them as gifts.
I honestly think my husband would be lost without it since he uses it all the time.
the bristles on this do-dad are tough and sturdy.
easy to fill and leak-proof, no matter how you lay the thing, it never leaks.
Hard to adjust the amount of soap to dispense.
It is especially helpful with greasy items - pots and pans, in particular.
I wish that there was more control over that.
But, it's really it isn't that big of a deal.
The nylon bristles can be cleaned easily after each use, so it doesn't get disgusting.
This is perfect for removing crusted food of a pan.
This is a great kitchen tool! I always have mine handy.Notes: 1.) The bristles are very sturdy.
In spite of all of my hard scrubbing, they have never bent or frayed.
2.) It's shape allows you to get a good grip *and* still be able to mauver around pots and pans.
3.) There is ample space to hold liquid soap.
You'll only have to refill it every couple of weeks.
I use this scrubber to clean my sinks and dishes with good effect.
The bristles are strong and hold up to tough use and really are effective for getting into nooks and crannies.
The bristles have held up very well & you can buy a replacement brush when needed.
I had their original model and now they've improved it.
The soap dispenser doesn't get plugged up with gummy dried soap residue anymore requiring a hot tap water rinse to work properly.
And quite honestly, my palms have never been cleaner.
I use this to clean my spiralizer (Paderno).
It works great to get into the crack and blades.
I ordered this because I'm tired of using the scrubby pads that are on kitchen sponges.
I hate that they tend to hold onto stuff like gooey cheese and shred much too easily.
Yuck! This does the job without getting all gunky and it rinses clean easily.
It digs dirt out of grooves and tight corners.
It's great for cleaning the sidewalls around rivets, too.
What it won't do is take off really stuck-on food, but no brush will do that.
The brushes attach to the head securely, but are easily removed for replacement.
It's holding up well for almost 2 months of daily use.
They do not leak the soap all over as I had happen with other types of soap dispensing brushes.
The spring in pump-top of my Crate and Barrel bought brush broke so I ordered this.
These bristles are stiffer than my old setup, plus my old one was the stainless steel model.
I kept the new cap for my old brush and tossed the rest of this one.
I like this! Unlike the wand version it does leak soap all over my sink.
The palm-shaped handle makes it great to grip and scrub.I will say that I feel like I use much more soap with this.
That might just be a personal issue I have with not paying attention.
This is a great tool for use in the kitchen.
I am impressed with this economical tool by OXO.
The bristles, so far, are holding their own.
It's very hard to release just the tiniest of soap.
Just fill it with dishsoap and use when you want to wash a pan or dish without have to put it in the dishwasher.
FUNCTION:Great for scrubbing pots, plates, pans, and bowls.
This scrubs oily dishes without getting super oily itself.
Its easy to use and comes with a screw off top so you can easily fill it with soap.
You obviously can't really use this affectively on cups.
Just wish they came in multiple colors like the red, green and blue brushes for those of us wok keep kosher.
I had another one of these that leaked.
Beyond that, it does as it should--dispenses soap and provides a brush for washing dishes.
I love all of Oxo products and this little dish scrubber does not disappoint.
It is really sturdy and holds the dish soap in without it leaking.
It looks much nicer than a sponge or long dish brush and holds up really well.
It also fits really well in your hand and feels comfortable while you are using it.
I have been using it for over 6 months now and it is still in great shape, would highly recommend!.
I bought this for the office break room and it works great.
It is easy to refill and super quick to clean dishes.
This is a very sturdy and nice palm brush.
So handy to use for my husband and myself.
Sturdy device, and have used with confidence ever since receipt.
Nice bowl drains pasta and the handle holds up well.
Was able to toss my rusty standby with confidence!.
I was making jelly for the first time, and bought this (since the recipe recommended a fine mesh sieve).
I should have probably bought a much larger one, since it didn't hold very much.
I was straining apples and peppers for the jelly, and it worked very well.
I use it mostly for straining stock, and it's big enough to handle large quantities of liquid at a time.
The mesh is fine enough to catch even the smallest particles.
Really, what's not to love about this strainer.
There are cheaper strainers, but I doubt they're as well built as this strainer.
I own many Oxo kitchen tools and the 6-inch strainer is another example of the company's dedication to producing quality products.
It is very sturdy with a fine mesh basket and is long enough to prop across the smaller side of my double sink.
This is not a large strainer, so if you want a more versatile size, the 8-inch strainer would be a better choice.
My favorite cookbooks are "The Professional Chef" by the Culinary Institute and "Culinary Artistry.
I purchased this product when I began using citrus juice in many of my meals.
This product is very useful and has many more applications than just straining juice.Pros:1.
Excellent for straining citrus juice to keep the seeds out of your foods2.
Fits well over the top of a blender jar3.
Hooks easily to the side of pans to keep if from slipping4.
Excellent for removing small pasta from boiling water6.
Handle stays cool so that you don't need a potholder7.
I recommend this product to anyone that loves to cook.
I was looking for a strainer that would keep quinoa from falling through.
Other reviewers said it was good for quinoa.That was a deciding factor for me.
So thanks to the people who thought to mention it.
This strainer is well made and seems sturdy.
I purchased this strainer specifically for straining cold brewed iced coffee.
The size is perfect and lets me do a large volume at one time.
My only complaint is that it has started to rust already after not too long.
I love OXO products though and would highly recommend.
Bought both the 6" and 8" Oxo sieves.
After all, they are only strainers to remove water from food.).
The worst part of making Quinoa is the rinsing part.
And it can get messy with all those tiny grains.
My strainers were not fine enough to prevent some from falling through the screen.
Saw some reviews saying this was good for quinoa.
I have used it several times and it works perfectly.
I've always had good luck with Good Grips OXO brand.
Another great buy!I am not sure if it is available cheaper in stores as none of the stores in my town carried this item.
I would check stores first to price compare.
I wasn't sure about purchasing but am glad I did.
It works well for the smallest grains, Quinoa for example, that I use.
I figure I have bought my last strainer.
The mesh is pretty small, too, so you can use it to rinse Quinoa and it doesn't pass through.
I should have bought the bigger 8&#34; size.
I generally like OXO Good Grips products and this is no exception.
Beautiful, sturdy, and rests nicely on a pot with the stainless steel parts.
I bought this strainer to strain my home-made soy milk and it does a great job.
It seems to be rather sturdy (I'm referring to another review), but time will tell.
I really like that I can rinse quinoa without the grains slipping through.
I'll report how it holds up next year.
It fits inside my pot to steam broccoli.
I use it to scoop shrimp or other things out of larger pots.
IIf you want to save some $ get the 8 inch else you'll end up like me and buying BOTH.-awr.
The mesh on this strainer really sets it apart from other, cheaper versions.
It doesn't indent or bend out of shape like others do.
Ask a cheaply made strainer to do those things, and some bits get stuck.
My wife wanted one to strain quinoa and this one works great! Well made and seems durable.
I bought this for the french press coffee grounds and i didn't want to clog up my kitchen sink and this item works great.
This strainer has just the right size mesh for straining puddings.
The handle fits nicely into my hand, very comfortable.
ATK says the handle will break but I am not that hard on equipment.
It was very slightly out of round when it arrived, like it might bend easily.
This is a great little strainer, its serves many purposes.
Its especially great for rinsing berries and quinua (sp).
Would like the mesh to be a little tighter.
Things like separated butter solids strain through with the clarified butter, but nothing that lining the strainer with a few layers of cheesecloth can't solve.
I have recently started to do alot more baking and also using a deep fryer for cooking turkeys, onion rings, etc.
After all, as in any job, time is money.
Another important consideration is how well things pass the taste test.
lolIt came to my attention after needing to strain oil and also flour and 10X sugar that I did not have a versitale strainer.
I can not recommend the Ebelskivers high enough either.
They are so light and airy and you can make them for any time of day meal.
Do yourself a favor and check them out.
Cleaning is a snap by just rinising it in water after use.So, in conclusion, if you are looking for a strainer I recommend this one.
The size is also ideal because you can do so many things with it without it being way to large or way to small.
I use it to wash rice and beans or anything else I want to strain the liquid from to make sauces.
It's disgusting but it helps keep the drain running.
I've been using this strainer about every other day for a couple months now and it still looks brand new.
Says it's the best one she's ever seen or used in her 84 years of life.
Perfect size for straining all kinds of things.
The mesh is double which makes it very strong and the handle is comfortable and strong.
It is great for small items that might go through the holes of another strainer.
This is the best mesh strainer I have.
I love it for tiny pasta, crushed pineapple, etc.
It's mesh is fineenough to where the product does not leak through.It is not flimsy and seems to be well made.
I love this finer mesh for the sprouting that I do.
The handle is good to sit in my sink and easy to clean.
I am a foodie and as such, I own quite a few strainers.
I have yet to get a 'dud' from the Good Grips collection.
I broke two strainers trying to make seedless blackberry jam, and everything else in the house had holes that were too large.
I put the berries and the juice in the freezer and waited for this strainer to arrive.
It's perfect--for everything you need a strainer for.
It's sturdy, has two layers of mesh and is the right size.
It might seem expensive, but the quality is excellent, and I can tell it will last for years and years.
The sieve is very fine and holds a lot--great for my making yogurt cheese and baking needs.
Really love this, and the handle is very comfortable, too (as are most OXO tools).
The little tip on the opposite side is terrific for supporting it in a bowl, something I consider essential but many sieves don't have.
You always know you're going to get a quality product with oxo good grips- nothing too fancy, but sturdy and well-built.
I use it for quinoa since it has mesh fine enough to not let any through.
But the holes aren't too small to make it generally useful.
It is dishwasher safe.If I don't give it a fifth star it is for the simple reason that I would prefer an all metal handle.
No strainer handle should be over a flame, but if I make a mistake it will take longer to cause a problem!.
I have owned any number of strainers over the years, but never one like this.
It is thoughtfully designed and made of quality materials.
I am looking forward to many years of service from this strainer.
Great job with straining quinoa, which cannot be done in most sieves.
I bought this today to strain my homemade yogurt.
My yogurt usually isn't really runny before straining, either.
It IS large...so large in fact, I'm not sure how I'd put it in the fridge overnight to make yogurt cheese.
All the other yogurt strainers on the market aren't big enough or are too delicate.
This holds enough that I can strain 2 qts.
of yogurt at a time in about 20 min.
Its temporary resting place is the dish drainer ;).
I love OXO products for they have never failed me and are so easy to clean.
I had a strainer that my mother used for many years.
It didn't owe me a thing when it fell apart!  I could see a real difference in this one.
Extremely well made...might be able to hand down to my granddaughter!  The mesh is very fine and does an excellent job!  Very pleased.
Sturdy and i'm sure it will last for a long time.
How much can one say about it? It does what it's supposed to do and it's well made.
I was looking for a BPA free fine strainer to rinse quiona and this one fit the bill perfectly! Oxo makes great, dependable products.
I love the hook on one end that allows me to rest the strainer on a bowl and free up my hands.
I began soaking and rinsing all my nuts, seeds and grains to remove the unhealthy acids.
I use this to rinse the food in filtered water.
It's big, easy to handle, and high quality.
I bought this to replace an old strainer I had used for years that had belonged to my Mother.
This OXO strainer was the closest I could find to what I had been using.
The little loop on the end helps this balance on bowls making it easy to pour your food without spilling.
The handle has a nice grip that doesn't get hot and is easy to hold.
I have no doubt that this will last for years.
If you need a Strainer you can't go wrong with this one.
It's verysturdy and has an excellent rubber handle for easy gripping.
When I wrapped it up for my fianc&eacute; and put it under the tree he knew what it was immediately.
He was excited to get it and I love when he cooks for me so WIN WIN! the quality of this product is good.
I use this to strain jars of fruit, boiled potatoes, etc.
It's a good size, not flimsy and hasn't rusted.or had the mesh pull away from the rim.
I've had it for a long time and am just reviewing it now.
Would definitely buy this again if it were lost...meaning if my son or husband took it.
So much so that I hung it on the tool rack with the other everyday essentials.
Great size, well made, sturdy, and even looks nice.
I had been making do with a smaller strainer which has been retired.
I have a colander but now use this more.
I hand wash mine but I can;t see why you couldn't put it in the dishwasher.
Finding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to OXO.
All the handles look great, but are also very comfortable and practical.
This strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people.
You have to make few enough in each batch that they can all rise to the top at once.
Then you scoop them all up with the strainer (the bigger strainer may be hard to fit in many pots).
Drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel.
Excellent product!  Would make a wonderful wedding shower gift.
I bought this to strain quinoa that would've slipped through the larger slits in my pasta colander.
I was looking for something that made washing quinoa less tedious.
I bought this particular strainer because another reviewer was pleased with its preformance.
It was not that hard to clean by hand, and it takes up little space in the cabinet.
I often rinse quiona or rices only to lose some down the drain.
So, I bought this super strainer which has solved the problem.
It's quite large, so easily holds two cups of grain.
I don't use it a lot, but it seems to be fine quality and is certainly holding up well for me.
the loop at the end makes all the difference if your straining to a bowl.
The mesh is also durable and holding up well.
I went to a big chain store that sold several varieties of look-alike strainers.
The OXO was the only one that held together.
On every other strainer, the screen came off the rim.I've been using this strainer regularly for a year.
The wire mesh is still perfectly intact, smooth and round (unlike other strainers I've owned that are riddled with dimples).
The mesh has also been fine enough for all of my needs, without having to also use a cheesecloth as I did with other strainers.
It is large enough to hold a whole can of veggies.
The white plastic kind, the wooden handle kind, but none have ever matched the quality of this strainer.
It's amazing what a difference quality tools will make in the kitchen.
But they were getting rusty and they just felt cheap.
The handle has a good grip to it, the mesh will have you rubbing it a little when nobody's looking, and it just looks classy.
The 8" size is the perfect general-use size.
The price is a little steep for what I'd normally want to pay for a simple tool, but it was worth it.
It looks like it's made well and like it will last for quite a while.
We use this all of the time! It is amazing.
I find that all the items I get for my kitchen form the OXO brand are just perfect.
It's reliable and not expensive and the rubber handles that they always use are awesome, nothing slips and falls out of my hands.
This is meant for sauces, to make them smooth and silky but I really use it for just about anything.
Heck, you can even put powder sugar in this or flour for baking and sieve it to perfection.
I have multiple sizes of strainers in my kitchen because they are so extremely handy to have around.
I love OXO products in general, and this one matches their usual standard.
It is well made with double weave, that is, two separate layers of mesh to prevent even very small particles from getting through.
The handle doesn't heat up, which is very important.
Finally, in a pinch, it can double as a flour sifter.Highly recommended.
I got this for my chef in training daughter.
She loves it and uses it all of the time.
I love this bad boy, good handle, good size drainage, and it sits across bowls or pots really well.
Glad I purchased it and would recommend it again, in a minute.
I have been strainerless for a few years.
I have somehow muddled through, but now that I have this awesome strainer, I don't see how I made it.
Like most OXO products, this has a great grippy handle.
The mesh is tight enough to catch even small chunks, and the strainer is large enough so I can balance it across my sink.
Frustrated with trying to wash small grains using my colander lined with cheesecloth, I ordered this mesh strainer.
For these duties, the 6-inch size is perfect.
It fits into my 3-quart saucepan with enough room to swirl it around to catch the goodies.It's pretty deep, too, holding two cups of grain.
No need for a measuring cup!After washing the strainer, I recommend hanging or standing it upright to dry.
At first, I laid it flat on my drying rack, but the mesh didn't want to drain out very quickly.
When I stood it up, the mesh drained out immediately.
I used my potato scrubber to clean this strainer after a messy job.
It doesn't have a tendency to tip over on its side in your hand like some other strainers do.
The size of this makes it perfect for what I use it for; incorporating flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder, etc when baking.
It's large size make it a suitable substitution for a more expensive French tami.
Unlike a tami this has the ability to be suspended over a bowl hands free.
It's also handy as a cooling sieve for freshly roasted coffee beans.
About the only thing she wished was that the basket part was deeper, and perhaps an inch wider, but it certainly works as is.
And, the quality of the product is excellent!  She compared to the one it replaces and there really is no comparison.
She had bought that old one at a store similar to K-mart, as an example.
It had lasted her about 12 years but then the basket separated from the flimsy edge holder.
I fully expect this Good Grips unit to last the rest of our lives, it's so sturdy and well made.
I've used it with both hot and cold items and it works well with both.
The mesh is small enough that I was able to use it to wash medium sized grain without losing any.
I've placed it in the dishwasher multiple times and it hasn't rusted.
I find I use this a lot to strain my plain whole milk yogurt overnight to make Greek yogurt, clean rice, rinse beans, etc.
It's the perfect size for so many things and fits my pots perfectly.
I've been using this strainer for a long time now almost daily and highly recommend it.
I own two of these strainers, and they are used almost daily for a variety of tasks.
They are hanging on hooks on my kitchen wall to keep them near at hand, and save on storage space.
I started out with one, then realized I wanted a second one because I sometimes prepare Indian dahl and basmati rice.
Both the rice and the lentils are washed several times and then soaked before cooking, but usually cooked separately.
I like to wash and soak them in the strainers in bowls of water.
The strainers are a perfect size for this task.
Each one can fit down really well in its own large mixing bowl.
After soaking, I can just lift them out, drain, and I'm ready to cook.
Handy for draining things.More recently, I have been experimenting with eating a raw food diet.
There can be a fair amount of soaking nuts, dates etc involved in the process.
So, if anything, my strainers are more in use then ever.
In some strainers this is loose, and so a lot of small particles of food stuff can get under the rim and be trapped.
Waste of food, and yuck!I have had both strainers for several years.
I am by no means delicate with my kitchen stuff, quite the opposite (not proud of this trait, but it's true).
These have been packed and moved a couple of times also.
Still in excellent condition.For those who are concerned with cost, I bought each of mine at Bed, Bath & Beyond with a 20% off coupon.
This made them a bit more affordable, and quick if you need one right away.
I shop at Whole Foods, but I would never, ever by OXO products there as one reviewer mentioned.
Not with B B & B around nearby, where the price is lower even without the 20% off coupon.
I bought this to replace my large strainer that's many years old.
The pictures of this one make it seem bigger than it is.
It does have a great handle, and the opposing loop helps it sit in a sink.
The handle is rubbery enough to be nice and grippy while coming perfectly clean in the dishwasher along with the rest of the strainer.
It fits perfect balancing in my sink and is used constantly for everything.
It strains quinoa which is a devil to get thru anything else.
before I had this I would sorta smush it till the water came out..this solved the problem and also helped me w/boiling pastina.
I cook a lot, so needed to replace my existing strainer.
This one is very sturdy and well made.
It's large, but I'd rather have the large one (that would still handle smaller quantities), than a smaller one that wouldn't handle bigger tasks.
This is a nice strainer and well constructed.
It is small, so not good for large jobs.
I make seedless black raspberry jam and this worked great, Held up to my pushing the fruit thru to get rid of seeds.
I got tired of getting scratched by the old fraying strainer we used to use so I bought this.
It's great and you can set it securely over a pan.
After a messy lesson that quinoa was too fine for my finest strainer, I went looking for something that would work.
Thanks to awesome Amazon reviewers who specifically stated that quinoa would work with this strainer, I bought - and am glad I did.
The build is quality and a decent strainer.
I just wish the mesh was a little finer to filter more out.
I have the 3" (OXO Good Grips 3-Inch Mini Strainer), 6" and 8" strainers in this design.
The holes are very small which allows you to strain almost anything without losing part of what you're straining.
What I really love is the size including the length of it.
Works great for anything you need to double strain like soups.
Has a nice loop that rests against the pot and a comfortable handle.
It is well built with the dual wire/rod handle and solid, durable rubber grip.
Then again, the metal construction may survive that.
This is a very good, well made, functional, relatively easy to clean small strainer which gets a lot of use in our house.
They're perfect for berries or straining soup or rinsing rice.
The mesh is good enough to sift cake flower.
Another excellent kitchen utensil from OXO, this strainer is great in many ways.
In additional to use when sifting, it is useful as a colander.
I expect many years of use from this utensil.
I returned this strainer because I found one at the dollar store.
The mesh is pretty fine so straining stock/sauce with lots of small bits, it can get clogged -- but it strains everything.
Have been using this strainer for four years and it looks new.
We run it through the dishwasher.The little hook is nice from hanging it on a bowl.
It fits in the corner of my sink to allow a slow drain (like for frozen veggies).
As we think about downsizing, I may find a slightly bigger one to add and then give away big colanders.
This is a nice size to take care of just about every need I would use it for in my cooking.
I'm glad I chose this one versus a smaller one since I usually cook larger batches of items for storing later.
Can't wait to use it to make homemade ice creams!.
This strainer is large enough and filters well enough to do this task.
This is important when using it over the sink as it keeps it from slipping around when the water hits it.Nice!.
Great for scooping pasta out of boiling water.I really like OXO products...well made, user-friendly, dishwasher safe and they continue to look like new for years.
I can't believe I had to order this online.
Bed Bath and Beyond does not sell this size.
The handles are very comfortable and it is so easy to clean compared with other strainers.
I'm an OXO girl so I have never had a problem with any product or item I have purchased.
This strainer has a very fine mesh, as was noted by another reviewer, so I decided to try it.
The mesh on this one also seems to be stiffer than some other models of strainers.
If you're straining stock or broth, this is a real time saver.
You don't need to bother with cheesecloth -- this double rod strainer gives you a very clear product.
It's nicely made, and will probably last a long time.
This  Strainer is  Well Made, Sturdy and  a very important  item  l in my kitchen.
It's not just any old Strainer, it's Special.
I love this strainer, it is top notch and high quality! Spend the money for quality items and no regrets!.
This is an excellent, sturdy strainer with generous capacity.
If you have a hanging rack (I don't), you'll probably like the clip at the top.
This strainer looks nice and has a solid feel.
I expect it to last a very long time.
If you're looking for an ordinary hand-held strainer, this is a fine choice.
It does its job, it hasn't come apart, and it shows no signs of rusting or breaking.
All I want is a tool that does its job well.
Its hardest use in my household is straining "things" from my beer and mead brewing experiments.
That typically means 5 gallons of hot fluid with varying weights of things that must be strained out.
Didn't realize how sad my old strainer was until I bought this as a gift for my future son in law.
Went back and bought another for myself.It is sturdy, has nice fine mesh, and actually reaches across my sink to balance completely.
I love quinoa, but didn't love rinsing it first.
It's important to rinse it first to reduce the phytic acid in it, otherwise you will get digestive problems.
Can't speak for how it will wear or rust over time.
I thought it was a bit pricey, but it's very sturdy and worth the price, so right now I highly recommend it!.
This strainer takes a beating and always performs well.
I have used it daily for ten years and had no problems.
This will get you the two most common sizes for melon/vegetable balling and it's comfortable to use.
It makes easy cuts of little round balls and then releases them well.
The handle however is not too comfy to hold.
I purchased this to replace my antiquaited bent melon baller that I have had for over 20 years.
This new new has a great hand/weight feel, soft handle for marathon balling and clean edges for even balling with ease.
I have many OXO tools on my baking/cooking apron.
I own a lot of OXO brand kitchen tools and have never been disappointed by their quality and versatility.
I initially bought this to produce nice sized melon balls for fruit trays and fruit salads; it does a wonderful job.
It has a good grip and works well with no slippage.
It is comfortable to use and surprisingly efficient.It is dishwasher proof and sturdy enough to last a lifetime.
I'm assuming the hole may be for other purposes as well, such as ease released of the fruit.
I mainly use it to core my apples and wow, how convenient!!.
the OXO is really sturdy and, as with all their products, comfortable to use.
I can tell I'll get years of use out of it without it falling to pieces like my previous one.
It just goes to show, even with a product that only gets occasional use, it doesn't pay to get a cheap one!.
I can use it to cut watermelon into serving size pieces with no trouble! Also, OXO makes durable products.
Well, it's a melon baller..not much to say.
The edges are very sharp and it makes perfect melon balls (and cheese balls, and avocado balls, etc).
The two different sizes are why I use this one.
The larger end I use to make perfect melon balls for a pretty fruit salad.
It's just a great thing to have around.
This one in particular has a great grip on it, and the convenience of two sizes of scoops.
Well there's not much you can say about a melon baller.
I can imagine that there are situations where the little scoop is also useful, but I personally don't use it.
The handle is really great because of its texture.
When your fingers are slimy (making meatballs, etc.
can be a messy business), it's a good grip to hold onto.
This does what is supposed to- it takes some practice to get the technique of making nice fruit balls but works well.
When possible, I always purchase OXO products, as I find them as well made and durable as the more expensive brands.
If for any reason one of their products breaks or is less than expected, I've always gotten immediate and satisfactory responses from the company itself.
The handle is sturdy and the two sized scoops are very useful for different tasks.
I use it to drain or scoop out any small items, such as capers or olives.
I like the idea of using it for meatballs or even balling up the crumb for crumb cake.
It's a versatile tool not only to create melon balls.
Not that I can use it very well, but it makes balls out of melons.
Sturdy, good grip, I actually use it for baking purposes more than making melon balls.
Many uses for this fine tool.EDIT: It also cores apples!!! Just cut the apple in half and use the baller to scoop out the core.
I also use it to scoop the seeds out of fruit & veggies such as peppers.
I can definitely recommend this wonderful tool - if you're creative, the uses are endless!.
I love Good Grips products since they're well-made and built to last.
The rim on both ends is sharp enough to easily cut through the flesh of both vegetables and fruit which is a plus.
I'd order one even if on the moment I had no particular use for it.
Eventually you will and you'll be glad you had it on hand.
This is great for making melon balls or scooping out an apple core.
My mom destroyed or swiped my melon baller and left me with her old and rusty one.
I love it so much I had to buy another one.
I keep it at work to core apples.
I think I'll need to buy another for at home and maybe a 4th for a present for my mom :).
Have always wanted a melon baller and have never had any issues with OXO Good Grip products.
Each scoop has a tiny hole for drainage and pop out purposes.
Bought in July and item has no rust spots - always a good thing.
I have started letting my 7 yr old daughter use it and she has zero problems with it.
I've used it for cookies and I have used it to core apples to make apple tarts.
I've also used it for watermelon and honey dew.
I've used it to scoop ice cream.I even use it as a spoon.
Maybe I'm just good at holding things.Really, though, my wife uses it more than I do and she' never had a complaint.
If you are unimpressed, maybe you should examine your melon balling expectations and see if you might be setting the bar a bit too high.
Works like a charm, and I love the easy grip- very comfortable to hold and use.
It works; it's a nice size, and truly can be used in a variety of tasks.
This should definitely be something in your kitchen drawer.
I don't have a technique when doing it so the balls don't look like the way caterers get them to look.
Again, I'm a newbie baller and not sure if that is standard for melon ballers.
i dont see myself having any reason to dock a star, a pretty simple tool built the way it should be.
This thing is great! It's up for scraping the seeds out of a cuke, coring apples, and even (!) making pretty little melon balls.
It's easy to clean, it's grippy, and it comes with two different sizes on the ends - just one scoop didn't cut it for OXO.
They went above and beyond the call of duty.
If only the people who set the price on this thing would do the same.
And plums and other small stone fruit as well.
My daughter loves to entertain and didnt have a mellon baller so I ordered this for her.
I used it for watermelons for our bbq.
Great handle and grip and it's dish wash safe.
I used this at a friends house and was very impressed with how easily it peeled.
I have had several OXO peelers, and this is the best so far.
It looks great, cuts great and is very easy to hold.
It is very sharp out of the box, and after 6 months of use it is still going strong.
Well built, comfortable in the hand and does the job they were made for.
These OXO kitchen tools have proven to be amazing! I have yet to find anything that compares.
I have always dreaded using peelers, they always catch, get blocked by debris or just feel cheap and dangerous.
We have a few different peelers for when working together in the kitchen, and we always "fight" over who gets to use this one.
As for quality, it hasn't rusted or shown any defects in almost two years of use.
This includes throwing it in the dishwasher! The handle is large, comfortable and easy to grip.
Not only has this piece performed flawlessly, but the entire set I received has too.
I can only imagine how well the rest of their products will serve me.Whether for yourself or a gift (or both), OXO won't disappoint!.
I've had this peeler for over a year now, and use it frequently.
The other reviewers weren't kidding.This is (what I see) a typical OXO kitchen tool.
Heavy duty, good looking, and no groaning or bending when you attack really hard ice cream.
Add to that a handle large enough to put some serious carving power behind, and it comes up a winner.
I bought a bunch of individual Oxo SteeL utensils and love them all.
They feel substantial in the hand and I think they'll last a good long time.
I purchased many OXO utensils for my elderly parents after reading reviews.
My mom had a stroke affecting her dominant side and my father has a tremor on his dominant side.
Both found the utensils easy and comfortable to hold.
Ice cream and frozen yogurt scoops easily and comes out of the scoop easily.
I have only used it a few weeks, so I cannot rate on it's durability, but it looks sturdy pretty.
These OXO kitchen tools have proven to be amazing! I have yet to find anything that compares.
This ice cream scoop can scoop through the hardest of ice creams and not even flinch.
As for quality, it's made strong, hasn't rusted or shown any defects in almost two years of use.
This includes throwing it in the dishwasher! The handle is large, easy to grip and the scoop release works great.
Not only has this piece performed flawlessly, but the entire set I received has too.
I can only imagine how well the rest of their products will serve me.Whether for yourself or a gift (or both), OXO won't disappoint!.
Excellent buy will last awhile if your looking for a scoop that last awhile here it is NO DOUBT.
So enjoy makes life easier on your wrist and arms.
I wanted a more rugged scoop for those harder ice creams and this does the trick.
The lever in the scoop was an added bonus, and usually pops it out.
It is very sturdy and well made and releases the ice cream with ease.
The OXO brand is easy to trust with kitchen gadgets.
The serrated edge of this pie server helps cut the crust if you don't get it with the knife on the first go-round.
I got this pie server for my grandma.
We used it this past holiday season and it worked great.
I wasn't expecting this to be super sharp, but I love that it is.
I look forward to using it to serve pies and other things.
Sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste.
Expect the steel pie server to last a lifetime.
This server is perfect for right & left handers.
Has 2 sharp edges for ease in cutting cake, pie etc.
The cutting edge is nice and sharp for a clearly defined pie slice.
I have a drawer full of OXO kitchen tools so I definitely am impressed by OXO's product line.
It has a comfortable handle and is made of a sturdy grade of stainless steel.
It is flexible enough to make a non-messy first cut and it can slide under to pick up the last piece of pie.
Does exactly what it is supposed to do.
You might think it strange that someone could get excited and stay excited over an item as mundane as a pie server.
As it should happen, pies are hers and I never tread on her turf when it comes to preparing or baking one.
I always seem to reach for this one first though.To begin with, I like the feel of the chunky handle.
I feel it gives me more control over what I am doing.
It is simply the most comfortable server we own.
I like the double serrated blades, which are actually quite handy, especially when you are dealing with large cobbler type dishes of serving consistency.
(By that I mean that some of these dishes are much better served with a large spoon).
One of the best features of this kitchen tool though is the strength.
It is of stainless steel and cleans up very nicely in the dishwasher.
As I am the primary dishwasher in our family, this last fact is extremely important to me.
It looks very sleek without looking snobby, but at the same time has a very "professional" look to it.
It looks and feels like a kitchen tool should...attractive, yet extremely utilitarian.I will not lie to you; I am a big fan of Oxo products.
It is an excellent product.Note:  The server we presently are using is our third.
The two previous ones (Sigh, they were like members of our family, I tell you.), both "disappeared" at church suppers.
I have a deep and abiding love for OXO Good Grips items.
It is high quality steel and the edges are serrated so you can cut your food before serving it.
The handle is grippy and ergonomic, which is perfect for someone like me with arthritis.
I thought the small serrated edge looked wimpy but it cut through a very dense crust with no problems.
I gave it a five star because the price is just fair, the grip is good and does its job perfectly.
The OXO STAINLESS STEEL PIE SERVER is absolutely the best pie server made.
Both sides of the triangular "blade" (from the tip to about two-thirds of the way up) are serrated.
Also, the server will stand up to being stored loose in a general kitchen-gadget drawer.
I purchased another to have one available whenever the first one is in the dishwasher.
This pie server gets a lot of use in my household.
As with all oxo products, this item is quality made, and attractive being part of their new steel line.
It is the perfect size for a slice of pie, and the rather sharp serrated edges on both sides make for easy digging into.
If you're a fan of oxo products, you'll love this one.
Now you can have your pie and eat it too!.
I got this for my mother in law and she loves it.
The rubber handle gives it a nice touch.
I recently added it to my wishlist so I can get one too!.
It works and looks very good and I would heartily recommend it to all.
Most oxo products are awesome; this one is no exception.
It cuts very well and looks nice, too.
As great as the nylon one is, it's just not as strong and can't cut quite as clear of a line.
Love this - just what I was looking for.
It cuts well (the edges are serrated), and it has the weight & rigidity you want when dishing out a slice of pie.
I'm very excited to try and use it soon!.
This product is outstanding and I highly recommend it!!.
It seems very well constructed and is a more sturdy piece than many others.
If I'm looking for a new little kitchen tool, I always turn to OXO.
Sure, there are higher quality products out there, but again, I need affordable.
The handle has a great weight and the spatula is a great size.
Oxo SteeL Pie ServerThis Oxo pie server is durable, strong, comfortable, easy to use, and dishwasher safe.
I am happy to add this gadget to my ever-growing collection of Oxo items.
We bought this because it was a best buy from America's Test Kitchen....or one of the Cooks recommendations.
Find it difficult to remove a single piece of apple pie or pizza pie...use this pie server.
The item is durable enough to use for all food serving purposes -- cakes, pies, even lasagna, etc.
However, the wedge itself is fairly sizeable so small(er) slices may be more difficult to dole out of cakes/pies/etc.
The handle provides good grip and is comfortable to hold and doesn't slip when your hands are dirty.
The serrated edge is so nice because you don't have to get out a separate knife for cutting.
It is very sturdy and works quite well.
I purchased a second one for my Mother in law who liked mine.
This spoon is very well made, easy and light to hold, but sturdy enough to do the job.
I use it every day for scooping up cooked vegetables from my wok.
Stays cool even when left in a boiling pot.
Comes out of the dishwasher nice and clean.
Intended to use it as a serving spoon, but use it for lots of purposes.Update May09Still love it.
I focus on value shopping - doesn't have to be cheap, but must deliver value that justifies the price.
This spoon fits in with the rest of the tools I picked up.
This is a semi heavy spoon and the grip is very nice.
No problems at all to report thus far, I am happily pleased with it.
i have many utensils from this line, and just like the rest, this piece work beautifully.
The handle is a good weight and it's sturdy.
The only glitch is that the spoon is a little smaller than expected.
The slotted spoon, ladle and the serving spoons are all great.
I love all the OXO products I have purchased.
OK, it scoops food; so what?Well, this just has a darn good feel to it when I'm scooping food.
Ain't this all that counts?  Well, sure, it's durable.
I am very happy with this quality and construction of this product.
And I love that it is dishwasher safe.
I bought this masher to replace an old plastic one I had.
This one works better and is much easier to clean.
When I first saw this unique design I was doubtful that the masher would work.
But it does!  The masher is very sturdy; the handle comfortable to grip.
This tool will easily mash potatoes, other vegetables and fruits easily and quickly.
My old potato masher finally gave up the ghost.
So I was looking to purchase a new one.
You can always rely on OXO to deliver a practical, long-lasting kitchen tool for a very reasonable price.
The OXO Steel Potato Masher is a attractive and quite sturdy.
I've only owned it for a few weeks, but I can tell it will last for years and years.
I find a potato ricer (OXO makes an excellent one) is the better tool for mashed potatoes.
A potato ricer will leave you with the lightest and fluffiest mashed potatoes with no chunks.
Still, I'd recommend buying this or one day'll you end up trying to make applesauce with a bent spatula, like me.
How can you go wrong with a potatoe masher LOL..............it works great nice and sturdy very happy with my purchase.
Fits in a regular kitchen drawer for storage.
These OXO kitchen tools have proven to be amazing! I have yet to find anything that compares.
This masher works great without much effort, and the foods come out perfect.
As for quality, it hasn't rusted or shown any defects in almost two years of use.
Not only has this piece performed flawlessly, but the entire set I received has too.
I can only imagine how well the rest of their products will serve me.Whether for yourself or a gift (or both), OXO won't disappoint!.
I have always had cheap potato mashers that either bent or broke.
But, like most things, you get what you pay for.
This is why I decided to go with this one.
It doesn't bend or flex when you are mashing, and I use it for potatoes as well as other things like bananas and beans.
I wash it in the dishwasher and have had no problems.
A little pricey, but you might as well get something quality that will last a long time.
:(  Often I will boil the potatoes in a nonstick pan then, after draining, pour them back into the hot pan to mash them.
It weighs 6.9oz / 197grams.The entire unit is so sturdy and feels perfect in the hand.
The stainless steel head is amazingly heavy duty.
I was comforted to know that because I don't like chrome or mystery metal.
I'll pay more to get a nice grade of stainless steel every time.I could not be more pleased.
You could bonk an intruder on the head with this thing and do enough damage to get yourself out of the house safely, methinks.
:)  As for mashing potatoes - it doesn't get better!.
I chose 5 stars because this product is very sturdy, great design.
It mashed potatoes extremely well and it does the work not the person mashing.
I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't have an electric beater or who sometimes wants the texture from the old fashioned way of mashing.
This is my first masher and it didn't disappoint.
This is a great potato masher that is easy to use, ergonomic, and best of all for me, easy to clean.
It rinses off easily with the kitchen sink sprayer and also cleans nicely in the dishwasher.
I have found that this masher is definitely worth the money!  It will last forever, it seems!  Happy mashing!.
It produces very thin clean cut slices of cheese and is really easy to clean.
I do not put it in the dish washer.
As a kid, I would eat bagles toasted with melted cheddar on top every morning.
I had a great cheese slicer with a thin, round, wooden handle and loved it.
Stocking my own kitchen, I wanted to get a cheese slicer that was as enjoyable to use.
This slicer has none of these problems.The handle is designed well.
It feels very comfortable, sturdy and looks great!  I liked my old wooden handle slicer, but this dishwaser safe one is better.
I can make it through a pound of cheese very quickly, producing uniform slices.
Some people might like slices that are thin enough to be slighly translucent, but I prefer the slices you get with this.
of course, you can use it to peel things too.
It's sharp enough to hangle mangos, but will take off a thicker layer from apples/potatoes/etc.
than a good peeler.The slicer's only con is a narrowish slicing blade.
The old slicer i had was almost wide enough for a land-o-lakes (pretty standard) size pound of cheese.
This slicer will have room to spare with the more square shaped pound of cracker barrel cheese, but not much.
OXO SteeL Cheese PlaneThe OXO SteeL cheese slicer has a nice stainless steel blade and an attractive brushed steel section running down the middle.
The rubber handle grips give it a nice feel in your hand, similar to the slicer from AnolonAnolon Cheese Slicer.
That one has a handle that is made out of black plastic.
It's still big enough to almost cut from a standard cheddar block.
If you want a solid handle and don't mind a more narrow blade, this is the way to go.
If you don't mind the plastic handle and want to save a few bucks, give the Pedrini a look.Enjoy!.
This is a good purchase, if you just want a cheese slicer for every day use.
It does a very quick and easy job of slicing all hard cheeses.
It also worked on soft cheese, a lot better than I thought it would.
After complete kitchen remodel in 2010, I looked far and wide for an under counter stainless steel electric can opener to match my appliances.
I was stunned to find there were none on the market despite extensive research.
After struggling with my old Zyliss (emphasis on the Old), this OXO works effortlessly.
After sucking it up and paying more than $3 for a can opener, I can honestly say I'm glad I did.
Have been using it for daily for a year and it works so well.
If it ever breaks, I am buying a copy.
The fact that this is a quality product will be obvious as soon as you take it out the packaging.
By just picking it up you get the impression of heavy duty quality.
I'm sure I'll get years of use from this opener.
Because of it's size you get a good mechanical advantage on first penetrating lids; and the oversize knob makes operating the cutter very easy.
You don't have to have arthritis to appreciate the ease of use provided.
Cuts through lids like a hot knife through butter.Highly recommended!.
AWESOME can opener - heavy duty and high quality.
I like products like this one because they will last probably forever!.
Comfortable even for arthritic hands and well built.It works so easily that often it doesn't even feel as if it were working, but italways does.
I bought this about 3 years ago and it has performed very well, opens the can with minimal effort.
No rust has appeared which had been a problem with my previous can opener.
Excellent addition to my kitchen!  I needed to replace the cheap can openers that I purchased after my Pampered Chef one broke.
The only downside is that it can not be washed in the dishwasher - other than that - fantastic!.
Fast, easy to turn, the cutting action is smooth and have not had any problems with different size cans etc.
Love the handles as they feel ergonomically comfortable in your hands.
Have read other reviews on this and I have not nor plan to put these in the dishwasher.
For a hand can opener, this is easily the best that I have ever operated.
Got tired of an electric can opener that was a pain to keep clean & took up counter space.
Bought other battery & hand openers that we ended up throwing away.
This opener is almost easier than an electric.
It doesn't get the very last piece of the lid, but just twisting it gets it off.
Great product! Easy to use, have only used it a few times but seems very sturdy, is very easy to turn.
Great quality - the handles are comfortable and do not hurt your hands when opening.
Had some concerns when researching this, as looked like may be &#34;cheap&#34; feeling--is not.
Very hefty and solid, opener works flawlessly, and is comfortable in hnad.
Hands down, this is the best can opener I've used in my entire life.
The large handle makes opening any can so easy.
I think this will last many, many years.
I used to buy cheap $1 can openers at the dollar store.
After I broke the 10th one I realized the stupidity of those cheap products.
The Oxo can opener is a superior product that will outlive cheap can openers by 20 times the product life.
We have been using the same rusted out-hard to open up can opener forever.
Always saying we need a new can opener but never getting one.
The first time using this we said to ourselves how dumb we were to wait so long to get a new one.
So smooth and quick and effortless to open a can.
It's the perfect weight and looks sharp too.
This is definitely one of those you get what you pay for lesson learned situations.
I am 71 and have carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndromes of the right hand/arm.
This can opener is a joy to use and requires not much strength to open a can.
Didn't want an electric can opener sitting out all the time and they wind up not working after a while anyway.
The manual cheapies are hard to work and I've gone through about 5.
So stupid since I would have saved money just paying up front for a good one.
Can't tell you how pleased I am with this OXO can opener.
The woven "strap" is adequate, and seems securely attached.
They suit me just fine, and I am very happy with them.
The OXO opener is absolutely so easy for my arthritic hands to use.
A little pricey compared to the model under it but I keep mine on the counter top so this one really looks nice.
I look forward to years of use out of this set and plus it looks cool too.
I broke several cheaper openers, but this one feels solid and I have no problem opening the cans.
I don't have to struggle with THIS can opener.
It is well worth the price; it cuts through cans like a HOT knife through butter.
And it opens flat so you can get to the moving parts for a thorough cleaning.
I don't know if my old can opener was a complete POS, but this opener is so much nicer.
If you are like me, you have likely tried several can openers and most of them have likely been of the electric variety.
Stop searching right now and pick up this Oxo Steel Can Opener.
This opener gets it right almost every time and on the first try.
I know it's difficult to rave about something so simple, but sometimes it's the simple things that matter.
My only complaint would be a simple one: it takes up a bit too much space in the utensil drawer.
But I'm more than willing to live with that if I can have a simple product that works.
Wish I had this years ago and did not wasteMoney and time searching for another.
It is a finely crafted, well balanced solid unit.
It makes me think of teutonic surgical instruments, or picking up a 7-10 split.
Cans quake in fear at its mere appearance.
It slices through can tops like some metallic surfer carving the galaxy.
It is truly a samurai katana of a can opener.
Don't balk, just buy it, you'll find yourself grinning like a winner every time you reach for it.
I got this and my first impression was how sturdy it felt.
When I started using I was not disappointed in the least.
The mechanisms that cut the can are nice and snug to the can making it a breeze to open.
Electric openers might be easier to use but when you consider space requirements this is the way to go.
I had almost given up on finding a good manual can opener.
I have always used an electric can opener but occasionally needed a manual one for those over-sized cans.
I bought several supermarket versions and they were not much cheaper than what I paid for this OXO, however they were useless.
The last one I bought looks like it is really good quality but it simply doesn't work.
I needed to free up counter space so I put the electric one away and started using the manual I had bought.
Nine out of ten times I had to pull out the electric because the manual didn't work.
There is no brand name stamped anywhere on it and I couldn't remember the brand.
I wanted to complain to the manufacturer, it was that bad.
I remember the really cheap metal manual I had in my camping gear working better than the last two I bought at the supermarket.
So after reading the reviews on this OXO I decided to give it a try.
I can't believe how beautifully it has worked for me.
I am very happy with this OXO and may never need my electric can opener again.
I also love that it doesn't tear the paper from the can, like my last cheap one did.
I have owned many can openers and this one is by far the beat.
It opens the can smoothly, no missed edges and the lid never falls into the product.
I have purchased this can opener a month ago and I really like it.
I have not had any problems with it so far.
It is very easy to use and does not 'slip' off the can like a lot of other can openers do.
When I make soup, I open a lot of cans.
My husband has commented that is makes opening cans very easy.
I have tried every possible kind of can opener and they all, for better or worse, can't compete with this one.
Even the turner is large and comfortable so it does not dig into your hand while opening the can.
So effective and comfortable, even my young kids can use it.
Also, it can be washed int he dishwasher!  No more grimy grubby openers which can never get properly cleaned by handwashing.
I don't like electric can openers because they get nasty fast, very unsanitary.
I prefer to toss this one into the dishwasher.
I'm assured a clean and sanitary opener every time.
I actually came here to buy a couple more.
Products that work this well are a pleasure to preserve through hand-washing vs.
putting in the dishwasher.I intend to give it as gifts.
I just got this can opener and it works so well!  I hardly buy anything in a can, just tuna fish for my cat.
So I just need something handy about once a week.
The last one I had just got so dull, this one is fantastic.
I looked into getting an electric opener but am happy with this simpleand extremely easy to use opener.
My old opener was an ancient Swing Away, the only kind I've ever bought for the past 30 years.
Decided it was time for a change and ordered this opener because I've never been disappointed with an Oxo product.
I couldn't believe how easy it opened cans, even ones that were dented on the top.
I have frozen shoulder and mild arthritis in my hands.
The OXO easily opens cans of all sizes in a flash.
To keep it clean, we just toss it in the dish washer.
I needed something that worked! It not only worked but gone are the days of struggling just to open a can.
In my quest to downsize and take myself off the electronic grid as much as possible, this can opener is AWESOME.
No effort required and opens the cans cleanly.
I've only just begun to use it, but it's the nicest one i've ever used.
The ease of use is impressive, and it's very comfortable in my small hands too! All in all, i'm a fan.
I will have to see how well it stands the test of time, but for now, i'm happy.
I purchased this can opener as our old one started lose grip on the cans while opening.
I checked out Amazon website to see what's available and came across this one.Very pleased with the purchase.
I ran across this opener at a friend's house and couldn't believe how easy it made can opening.
Everything is relative, but I actually enjoy using it.
It always seemed like I needed a new can opener every year.
They would get nasty, dull, harder to use, the crank would break, etc.
Originally purchased 4yrs ago, and it still looks and works the same as it always did.
A very good investment, having easily outlasted every other one I've bought and will continue to do so for a good long time to come.
It gets the job done quicker than a standard can opener.
The large handles and turn piece are big enough to not have to strain your hand muscles!.
It is amazing how many horrible can openers there are.
We wanted a good one and bought this based on prior reviews.
This review will serve to echo the many that came before it...this is a good one!.
It is easier for us to open cans.
Both of us have arthritis in our hands.
No problems with the quality after 6 weeks.
It opens cans easily, the handles are comfortable, it's dishwasher safe, and it doesn't require any electricity to operate.
Hard not to like at  this reasonable price!.
I really like the feel of the knob it seems cushioned and fits a mans hand.
Its huge handle makes it easy to turn, the edges don't hurt your hands when you are opening it.
I've had this opener for 3 months and I'm very happy with it.
It is very easy to operate and the handle is broad; easy to hold onto.
I've had this opener for a couple I years now and it is amazingly easy.
I bought one for my 80+ year old family members and they use it with ease! It's a high quality product that will last!.
OXO's SteeL is the best manual I've ever worked with.
It locks onto lids without hassle and smoothly opens them with a minimum of effort.
The rounder, ergonomic turning knob sets it apart from your standard fare of openers and it just seems much easier to turn.
I've yet to find a can that it can't handle.
The stainless steel finish is still holding up beautifully after over a year of nearly daily use.
Our electric can opener resides in storage now.
I waited how many years to buy another can opener and now wished I had done it sooner! Effortless!.
I went from an electric to this product and I have no regrets.
It fits great in the utensil drawer and looks great with everything else that is stainless steel in my kitchen.
I would never guess that a hand can opener is easier to use over an electric.
Once you use this, you will NEVER want to use anything else.
I find myself buying canned stuff over fresh stuff just to use this....ok not really but it's that dang good!.
LITTLE PRICY BUT THE BEST OPENER I HAVE USED IN YEARS.
EASY OPENING WITHOUT MUCH STRENGTH AND THAT'S WHAT I SO NEEDED.
Love it!  As someone stated in their review, it is the &#34;Cadillac of Can-Openers&#34;!.
Love it and would recommend it, especially someone who may have joint pain.
no fuss, easy to use, easy to clean, won't jam up on younot complicated like the other can openers that cost more than their worth.
No need for an electric if you have one of these.
Heavy duty, high quality, very easy to use, even if you have arthritic problems.
OXO makes fantastic products for all kitchen needs.
Outstanding manual can operner!  Works effortlessly for right and left handed person.
Very clean cut and is worth the little more money as it will be the last can opener I purchase!.
Over the past year I have bought several manual can openers from a variety of places including Walmart and Target.
They all either never really worked or broke after only a week or two.
Now with this great product and my canned food, bring on the apocalypse.
OXO has so many great products and this is one of them.
Oxo Steel Can OpenerThis is another kitchen essential and Oxo has made one that is very ergonomic, as it fits your hand very well.
Stainless steel blades make it durable, and the large, soft turning knob is easy to manage.
When this opener is clean it works as brand new.
It stays on the lid without ever jumping off and has incredible ease of operation due to it's large mechanical advantage and handle construction.
I am very pleased with this can opener.
This product is manufactured in China according to the specifications of the US patent.An epicurean Bon Appetite.
Purchased this to replace an old can opener.
Does what it is designed to do, and the OXO brand is a lot cheaper than some of the "premium" brands.
Don't know if you have to pay a lot for a can opener.
A tip might be to clean the blade after you use it, which may help it from gunking up over time.
Remember, in a power outage, the manual can opener still works, heh.
This one is so much better than the cheap types I've subjected myself to in the past.
This one opens cans when I squeeze and turn the finger-friendly handle - that's all I wanted, and that's what I got.
several uses and no problems at all, no rust.
the big soft handle makes opening cans a breeze.
Smooth function, little rust in the 2 years we've had it.
The blade cuts into the can nicely, and the large handle makes it very easy to turn.
Easy to use (Ihave carpal tunnel syndrome, so I need kitchen gadgets that are easy to use.).
Sure it's expencive but you do get what you pay for.
This can opener works very smoothly, makes a nice clean cut and is comfortable in your hand.
THE KNOB ON THIS THING IS WONDERFUL!  IT CUTS REALLY WELL & IT'S A VERY STURDY OPENER AS WELL.
IT SURE SEEMS LIKE IT'LL LAST A LONG TIME.
These OXO kitchen tools have proven to be amazing! I have yet to find anything that compares.
This can opener is so smooth to operate and just won't fail.
As for quality, it hasn't rusted or shown any defects in almost two years of use.
Not only has this piece performed flawlessly, but the entire set I received has too.
I can only imagine how well the rest of their products will serve me.Whether for yourself or a gift (or both), OXO won't disappoint!.
This can opener consistently and easily does the job.
This can opener has been with us for about two years now and I can't say I have any complaints about it.
The handles with rubber grips are substantial and sturdy.
The can opening device (teeth?) has (have) not bent or given way to any cans.
And, the knob has been made of durable plastic, so it hasn't chipped or flaked.
We typically don't put this in the dishwasher, and I wouldn't really see the need to--hot soapy water works just fine.
Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to replace their can opener.
This can opener is my go-to even though I own an electric can opener.
Never-fail, smooth operation; it is a heavy, quality piece.
I bought it in case our power went out, but use it all the time!.
This can opener is THE smoothest manual can opener I have ever used.
It doesn't take up space on my counter top, it's easy to clean, and it's silent.
Yes, you still have to turn the handle or whatever, but it is nearly effortless, and I'm a tiny female with tiny hands.
Why waste electricity? I never thought I'd say this, but I won't be using electric any more.
It is smooth and little effort is required to open cans (even thick cans!).
This can opener works the regular way and cuts inside the lip of a can or cuts under the lip.
What ever way you like---it does the job and goes in the dishwasher!.
First crack of the can is its best feature as it does it so easily.
The wide black rubbery turner is comfortable and does a clean fast job of removing the can lid.
We had another OXO can opener previously, but this one is by far the downright best can opener we've ever owned.
I would highly recommend it if you want to make opening cans as easy as taking a breath of air.
It's very easy to use, especially useful for older people who may have arthritis or people with weaker fingers.
This is by far the easiest to use and clean and operate can opener I have ever used.
It opens wide for cleaning,takes minimal effort to use and works flawlessly.
I know it is expensive but it sure saves your arms, hands, shoulders and mind!! compared to others out there.
You do not have to struggle like some others to get them to work, if at all.
Very efficient and enjoyable to use and easy to clean.
This is one of the better can openers out there.
I like the fact that I can just pop it into the dishwasher when it gets food on it.
I've cleaned it in the dishwasher multiple times and so far there's no rusting.
This is the Bentley of all can openers, look no further! Easier than an electric.
I've waited over two years to write this review and it's working as well as day one.
This is the best can opener I have ever used.
Works well on both small and very large cans.
This is the best, easiest and fastest can opener I have used.I will never buy another kind again.
I imagine it is something to do with the shape of the dial and the sharpness of the blade.
All I know is that I love this can opener.
The the large handles make it easy to use and easy on your hands and fingers.
Built solidly and it looks like it should last forever.
This is the easiest to operate can opener I have ever used.
We wish we had replaced our other opener with this one a long time ago.
This Oxo 58081 Steel Can Opener is terrific.
It works like a charm and is really easy to hold; it is especially helpful for those of us with slightly arthritic hands.
Another real plus is that it washes beautifully (by hand) and won't rust.
I highly recommend this brand and model of hand can opener.
This item was received in timely fashion and in perfect condition.
This replaced the can opener I've had for about 10 years.
This opener glides through any can like a hot knife through butter.
I was amazed at first, then angry with myself for holding onto my old opener for so long.This is absolutely worth every penny.
I've got to warn you, though: you might find yourself making excuses to open can after can just for the fun of it.
Yes, it makes that much of a difference.
This Steel Can opener  is very easy to operate, cuts lids easily and efficiently.
I highly recommend this  great product from OXO.
This thing is solid, well constructed with no looseness and makes opening a can an almost enjoyable experience.
I've had a lot of can openers that start getting to be more of a battle with continued use.
The Mercedes-Benz of can openers!!  I also bought one as a gift.
Seemed silly at first spending nearly $20 on something as simple as a can opener, but I really am quite happy with it.
Was so tired of hand can openers that  break after a short period of time.
This product is made sturdy enough to last.
Works great on those large cans that the electric opener just can't quite handle.
We finally replaced ours after 10 or so years.
This is wonderful, sharp, easy to handle, and a good buy.
But then I found this one, and it's perfect.
We've been using it for about 6 mo.
We're pretty sure this is the best one out there and would highly recommend it.
The legs and handle are comfortable to grip and easily manipulated.
The opener latches on well and turns with gentle pressure, smoothly and quickly.
While the opener is bulkier than traditional openers, it is light!  This is a high quality kitchen tool.
We have been married 32 years and this by far is the best can opener we have ever owned!.
Handle is easy to turn, cut is even on the lid and on the rim of the can.
It's so nice to own items that work smoothly and well.
What can you say, it opens my cans effortlessly.
It has a nice large handle that is easy to use.
My wife is taking chemo therapy and she has some necropathy in her finger tips and she can use this opener easily.
When it came time to buy, it was a choice between this one or an electric one.
I chose this one simply because in thinking this would be easier to keep clean than a electric can opener.
Plus really,,,, how often do ya open cans ??? For me, not much.
So buying a manual can opener made more since.
Anyways,,,,,, effortless to use and being solidly built makes it a good buy.
it really does work super good, shipping fast.
nothing else to say, it does what it is suppose to without complaint.
Yes, I was suprised by how easy this can opener worked.
Having been the sole can opener in my household, I was used to our previous opener which died on us.
You pay a little more but you get an opener that will last you many rust free years.
I haven't had too much luck with carbon steel openers (quick to rust).
I got this for a friend and she is happy with this product so I am also, good quality and price.
This manual can opener works like a charm.
I didn't want to deal with an electric or a rechargeable, since they are more likely to fail.It is easy to grip.
It sets on the lid of the can easily.
And turning the knob to open the can is effortless.
It has some weight to it, which makes it feel well made and solid.
The teeth no longer gripped the can.I bought the "Oxo SteeL Can Opener" because of all the good reviews on amazon.
So far, I am very pleased with my purchase.
Amazon was the seller."Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:" (Isaiah 55:6).
I got this in Dec.'09 and it still looks like new.
Soft comfy handle, soft comfy knob, easy to start a cut in a can lid and best of all -- it's totally quiet.
There's no uncertainty whether or not a can will fall out of an electric can opener's feeble grasp.
I am sure that I will need another in a few years, but for the price, this one does the trick.
I have been through a million can openers and for some reason have had the worst luck with them.
This can opener is durable and cuts through cans like butter.
It's strong, pulls the lid into perfect place, and never misses.
If you've been using a cheap-o can opener, this one will truly impress you.
This is an easy to use can opener that opens cans flawlessly.
There is not much to say as it does what it is supposed to do.
WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS CAN OPENER IS THE EASE OF OPENING CANS.
If what you desire is inside of a can, then this can opener will open it.
PUT BIG HOLE IN IT, SPECIFICALLY, AT THE TOP.
It will open ANYTHING--soup, corn (creamed or whole), beans, ham.
It will also open: hearts, minds, eyes, arms, doors, books, floodgates, Pandora's box, and, curiously enough, marriages.
It is effortless, smooth, and a total badass.
It's so easy to use, a blind dolphin can use it.
You COULD get a cheaper one for $4.
Yes, you could be a hater and do that.
Pencils, socks, books, CDs, cell phones, Sacagawea dollar coins, Little League trophies.
You will wish ALL OF THOSE THINGS came in a can.
One of the many reasons your current can opener sucks a left nut is because it's not stainless steel.
Therefore, your crappy can opener is sucking this can opener's left nut.
I must admit that this not the exact OXO can opener that I have.
Mine is exactly like it except it has the soft handles - not like the less expensive model with the bottle opener.
Otherwise mine is identical and I wouldn't be able to function in the kitchen without it.
I've had mine for about 3 or 4 years - maybe longer - time flies.
I saw where only a few reviewers were disappointed.
I don't understand how that could be possible.
Also, got tired of taking up counter space.
I don't think anyone will be sorry for buying this can opener.
This can opener is not only pretty, but easy to use.
It doesn't jump off the can rim and the turning handle is very good for arthritic fingers.
This critter opens 8 cat food cans a day, day-in and day-out along with an assortment of pantry products for the family.
All my previous purchases were the lower end of the OXO Can Opener.
I decided to buy this more expensive model because the rubber handle portion is only towards the end of the handle.
My other OXO can Opener broke at the joint of the rubber and the stainless steel although I used it for several years.
I believe this model be the best choice.
I would recommend it to my friends and other relatives.
Only small oddity is that the turning knob is so large, its hard to slide into the drawer.
The knob has to go downwards in the drawer for my drawer to close.
But minor compared to the ease of use.
We have been using ours for about 5 years and it is still going strong.
It is fast, easy to use, and comfortable.
There is no pain or discomfort when holding it.
It cuts the can cleanly and is just plain easier to use than electric can openers.
I thouhgt about buying the one touch can opener till I read the reviews.
This had good reviews and I still liked a manual can opener.
It turns very easily and thats what I was looking for.
So I guess it's 4 ++ and to me that equals a 5.
I buy a lot of OXO kitchen items and invariably review them positively on Amazon.
It has a nice weight to it, but more importantly it is very easy to use.
It cuts through cans like they were made of butter.
It is comfortable in the hand and can handle any size can with little to no effort.
It is well made and easy to clean, though as the manufacturer points out it should be hand washed.
It has soft hand grips which adds to the comfort factor.
It Is also great for anyone who might have arthritis in their hands or lack upper body strength since it requires very little effort.
THIS PRODUCE IS GREAT!!! Best I have every used--it is easy to grip, sturdy, glides around the can effortlessly.
I've had tons of manual openers too and this has worked and lasted like a champ.
When you're done with it, just throw it back in the drawer until next time - no more wasted space for an electric opener!.
We have used manual can openers for years with great success.
We decided to replace our last one as the cutter wheel was getting dull with age.
I've never quite gotten "the hang" of electric can openers-- if I get the can open, it's truly LUCK--not SKILL.
It is soooo well worth the extra money.
I just love Oxo's squirting dish brush (the only one I've ever used that doesn't leak!), & I will definitely try more of their products.
Best one yet, ordered an under the cabinet unit, had my old one for many years and it  finally gave out.
Ordered anew one and that didn't go through 10 cans before it broke.
This a tank compared to all the rest.
I purchased this for my mom who has issues with her hands.
The large handles are comfortable and it consistently opens can without having to go around multiple times.
The large knob on this can opener makes it easier to use than the other can openers that we have.
Every time, on the first pass around the rim, it opens the can.
Now, I don't open a dozen cans a day.
I open one or two a day, so I'm not really stressed about how this would feel after hours of use.
The can opener's not ugly, but I can't bring myself to care about that either way.It's a good can opener.
IT IS JUST THE THING FOR WEAK HANDS.
This manual can opener is both easier to use and easier to clean than my old electric one.
It looks great, and lives in my &#34;gadget drawer&#34; so it doesn't take up space on my counter.
It handles really large cans with ease, and the over sized soft knob is a plus.
I'll never buy another electric can opener again!.
After going through about a dozen cheap can openers, I finally broke down and decided to invest in a good one.
I mean - it actually opens the cans, and you don't need to be Hercules to use it.
I've had it for several years and it was worth every single penny.
In fact, I had initially began my search for an electric can opener as my old one bit the dust.
Fortunately, at the end of my search, I wound up viewing the Oxo Steel Can Opener.
Once the can opener arrived I broke out a large can of soup and put it in action.
The wrench-esque knob enables you to slice through the can by effortlessly twisting it.Potential buyers should know a few things about this can opener.
1.) It fits your hand perfectly and comfortably.
2.) There is no extra strength required as the can opener slices through the tin top like a warm knife cutting through butter.
3.) The ease of opening cans cannot be overstated as many disabled or elderly people have a weak grip.
I bought a terrible $3 can opener, then a slightly less bad $5 can opener, then a still bad $10 can opener.
Then I gave up and finally bought this can opener which actually works consistently and well.
It's the same model as one that I had for who knows how many years, but the old one started loosing its edge.
This OXO can opener seems to be well made and most of all makes can opening a breeze.
I've gone through a lot of can openers and hope this one stays sharp and lasts.
It's not dishwasher safe, but is easy to wash by hand with a little soap and water and dry thoroughly.
It does not have the made in China stamp on it.
this opener is good for people with arthritis in their hands it turns very easily and for a good price.
These are so much better than what I've been using, and the old ones were not cheap!  Amazing how much better they are.
Had this for about a year now and it is still perfect.
Easy to operate and no issues grabbing the can.
The cutting wheel and surrounding area is not rusty or gunked up either.
I have owned this can opener for a couple years now.
It is the best one I have ever used considering both handheld and electric units.
It is very easy to use and cleans up nicely in the dishwasher.
Looks like it should last longer than I will.
All I wanted was a can opener that worked.
That actually cut the lid entirely and didn't leave little bits of steel to struggle with.
Using this opener is like riding in a Cadillac after having ridden a worn out scooter.
OK that's about as passionate as I can get about a can opener.
It's good, if you want a manual can opener that works, buy this one.
I bought this because my wife has arthritis in her hands and I hoped it would make it easier for her to open cans.
It helps, but not as much as I would like.
This is the best can opener that I have ever owned.
I have had it for 1 year and it has given me lots of use with no trouble.Its also very stlish and comfortable.
I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and using gadgets like this can be difficult for me.
This can opener requires less effort so its good for my hands!.
Wow !!!  How I wish that I had come across this "baby" a long, long time ago.
I am so pleased and happy with this fantastic can opener....I tell everyone that will listen.
This is a fantastic product and so worth the investment.
I absolutely love this can opener...and I just bet that you will too.
I have gone through so many can openers over the years.
I keep them clean, I keep them dry, I don't use them as weapons.
I've tried cheap ones, and even some pricey ones, and they're all the same.
So far, this OXO can opener has lasted the longest.
It's outlasted all of them, and has not even started getting difficult yet.
Time will ultimately tell, but I can say this is the best one I've owned so far.
Okay, my old rusty can opener died after many years of use.
Being a cheapskate, I was trying to stretch the life as long as possible, but finally it gave up the ghost.
While I was looking for a replacement I found this thing and read its many rave reviews.
It is very easy to "start", getting a good grip and "bite" into the can lid.
It has a smooth action, is easy to turn, and there is no slipping or skipping.
We've been using an electric can opener for years now, and it's all of a sudden decided to stop going around the can rim.
I contemplated getting another electric opener, but saw all the great reviews for this one and figured I'd give it a try.
It's a tad expensive but well worth the money.
I would highly recommend this product -- good for kids and adults with hand difficulties too!.
I HAVE ARTHRITIS AND THIS CAN OPENER SEEMS TO BE OKAY TO USE BECAUSE OF THE GRIP.
ITS NOT AS HARD TO TURN FOR ME AS SOME OTHERS WERE.
it does a great job of opening cans.
this one is easy to crank and it stays on the lid and doesn't track off or skip places.
it does what it is supposed to do and now days, any item that actually works as advertised is a rare thing!.
I don't want to have to take 20 protein shakes a day.
Every crappy can opener I would buy broke within a year.
I can already tell this is going to last awhile!.
We had an old can opener that well, didn't open the cans as one would like.
I have been trying more and more OXO products, and was pleased to find the can opener.
It turns so easlly and the cans open so smoothly.
I have been careful not to put it in the dishwaster.
my wife tends to be "can opener challenged".
It had the easiest mechanics, and it even had a bottle opener.
I've gone through quite a few can openers over the years.
This one is even better than the expensive Kitchenaid that I bought a few years ago.
The initial clamping down requires a firm clamp -- but then it's all smooth, effortless sailing from there.
The grip may feel a bit large for smaller hands, but it's not heavy -- notwithstanding the solid feel to the entire construction.
The big, wide "turn" handle is very nice.
I've gone through a few different models of can openers over the last 10 years or so.
From the EZ DUZ IT model to a fancy kitchen aid.
They all work, but not as well as this one.
It's about as easy as it gets to use and cleans easily.
So far, I've only had it for about 6 months, but I anticipate it will hold up for a few years at least.
I try not to throw it in the dishwasher, because I get the feeling that is what ruins these things.
As with most (not all) OXO products, you likely won't be let down.
Plus, it was a @#$%& to clean that little mechanism and involved a toothbrush.) and 3 handhelds (the "inexpensive" from W.
[aka the cheap-cheap-cheapy from China]; a more moderately priced Oxo from T.
I'm not a lefty at all.)  So, with great hesitation, I spent money one more time on this Oxo, based on the good reviews.
I was skeptical, having given up on can openers being good anymore.
Oxo got here in 2 days (love, love, love Amazon Prime so much) and I've been happy ever since.
I was hesitant to get another manual can opener, because they all seem to go kaput after a year or so.
The test will be in how long it works like this.
This oxo steel can opener is amazing!  I can't write enough good things about it.
Easy on the hands, just make sure to hold it closed or it will slip off the can.
After reading good reviews I purchased this can opener.
Even stainless steel will rust in the right conditions.
After using cheaper can openers this was a breath of fresh air! It's so comfortable and effortless to opens cans now.
Okay, my wife has rheumatoid arthritis and we've tried many manual can openers.
She was using it just the other day and I asked her why she didn't use the electric can opener.
She said for the smaller cans she likes to use the Oxo.
She held it up and smiled at me and said, &#34;I love it.&#34;  I cannot give a better recommendation than that.
I don't know why but many can openers seem to have trouble doing their primary function - opening cans!.
Let me just say that I love this so much that I want to marry it.
WAY easier to use than even electric can openers which sometimes fail to attach properly and the can falls off.
I once pledged my love to it as well.
So I purchased this one to replace it.
Wow! this guy can open anything! I order canned Blue W.
grain-free dog food five cases at a time, and when they're shipped to me, many of them end up dented, even on the top rim.
They got right back to me and asked me to email them a photo of the broken opener.
Awesome products and awesome customer service.Still, thank you, OXO, for your fabulous customer service.
Nice to know of a company that stands behind its products.
Until now!This can opener is easy to use, doesn't hurt my hand to crank, and won't break down like my electric.
In fact, since my electric one gets so messy after each use, I just pull this one out of the drawer instead.
No sense wasting electricity, even miniscule amounts, when this can opener is so convenient and takes little or no muscle to use.
It was a bit spendy for a can opener, but it should last a long time.
It is easy to clean but it doesn't even seem to get food on the blade like my electric one does.
The handles are nice and grippy, typical Oxo, and it has a nice weight to it.
It appears to be well built and pretty sharp.
I will never waste my money on electric can openers again.
You can even use this one when the power goes out!.
A perfect can opener.....I am hoping it lasts and lasts because of the ease of use.
A little pricey compared to others, but they don't last AT ALL.
This appears sturdier, less apt to rust and be inoperable in a short time.
This can opener, like most OXO products, is well-made andhas a good-feeling grip.
It works quickly with not toomuch effort but you must keep an even pressure near theend so the lid completely cuts off.
I would have preferreda can opener that leaves a smooth edge but I've had verynegative results with several of that type.
Every one Ihad left slivers of the can label, or even worse, sliversof metal which got into the food.
This is a good, sturdy can opener which is easyto use and should hold up for many years.
Care must betaken when removing the lid after opening, but I've solvedthat problem by never picking it up with my fingers.
I havesmall tongs which I use for that purpose - no more cut fingers!.
This one gets the job done right the first time.
This is a nice, modern, and well designed can-opener.
Attaches easily to cans, requires minimal effort to turn - which is especially helpful if you have weak hands or wrists.
I've been using an ancient swing away for 25 years and it just didn't work anymore.
It cuts clean and doesn't twist the can dumping liquid all over the counter.
I love the handle which protrudes out just enough so you can get a good easy grip and it turns effortlessly.
I think this is very well thought out, great product.
This can opener is better than any I have owned previously, but not perfect.
After a year or so, the gear mechanism is starting to slip when I first start turning the handle.
Also, the opener does leave a little strip of metal between the can and the lid, as some other reviewers have mentioned.
However, I have never owned one that doesn't do this.
This is sturdy, and ergonomically-friendly (got it for my elderly mother).
I checked it out and this is by far my favorite handheld can opener.
Even if you're used to the electric kind, this opens cans easily without much strain, has padded handles and is sturdy.
I read the reviews on this product before I purchased it and do disagree with a few of them.
Although the can opener works great I have yet to have it completely detach the lid from the can.
No problem as far as I'm concerned but I'm noting it because other reviews claim the lid is completely removed.
This OXO Can Opener replaces a similar opener of a different brand that, after probably 8 months of use, became difficult for me to use.
It simply, easily and quickly completes the job.
As a former Chef I am picky about using only quality kitchen utensils, and I heartily endorse this can opener.
Most manual can openers have a tendency to hang up or run off the lip of the can, but not this beauty.
&#34;You get what you pay for&#34; is never more applicable than with can openers.
This guy--after almost a year of (lots of) use--just takes a licking and keeps on ticking (er, cutting).
All sized cans are no match to this ergonomically designed machine.
Very easy to use, operates smoothly, doesn't require a lot of pressure to turn, comfortable handle.
Only negative if not dried right away starts to rust.
this is the thought that immediately popped into my head upon first using this can opener.
Oxo SteeL Can OpenerThis is the best can opener on the market.
it's just a can opener, but almost 3 years later, i'm still amazed by this kitchen appliance.
it opens cans so smoothly, and easily, and it's still clean and rust free.
I bought this on Novermber 30, 2011, but I wanted to wait a little while before I wrote this review.
Can openers have been the bane of my existence over the last several years.
So, so many of them work great at first, only to fall apart or stop cutting after six months.
It's been over eight months now and this opener still works like new.I'm the cook in the house, and I cook a lot.
This can opener works very smoothly, with very little effort, is very comfortable in the hands, and has so far stood the test of time.
I will update immediately if it does break or lose functionality.
If you're reading this and there's no update, it's still working great with heavy usage.
Opens cans so easily! Am throwing out my annoying electric can opener.
I have had it for a while and no rust either, unlike every other can opener I have had!.
I have been very pleased with my purchase of the OXO can opener.
This can open anything from soup cans, large fruit cans, and large coffee cans easily.
I have read that OXO designs their products so they will be easy to use, and easy on your hands.
I have found this can opener to live up to being easy to use.
If you are looking for a replacement can opener, I think you will find this a good one to choose.
Solid, sturdy, smooth and effortless operation, feels like it will last a long time.
Very happy I got this one and not an electric opener.
A little pricey, but if it lasts it will be worth it.
Hope his one doesn't  get rusty, as it isn't cheap.
Have been washing by hand and not putting on dishwasher so maybe it will last better.
Love the big knob and the way the handles fit in my hand.
I remember when I was a kid and my parents got one of those electric can openers.
We were mesmerized watching it do its work.
I've used manual openers ever since.I'm not sure why you'd want to pay more than $15 for a can opener.
This strong and durable one from Oxo does the job remarkable well.
Cuts cleaning and smoothly and goes all through the lid without your having to twist and pull that last little sliver of aluminum.
Solid construction that grips well in your hand and even kids can turn it without problem.
This really is the best bet for the money.
I don't like electric can openers so I am always looking for a nice manual one.
The expensive pairs are nice but I have to say that they are not as comfortable as this one.
I hate looking for a can opener when I need one so I keep several around.
For the price this is a great value and even though I have large hands it's really comfortable.
Slight amount of corrosion after a year but you have to look really close.
I was so tired of can openers working for a week, then I got this guy.
This little baby feels great in my hand, is easy and smooth to operate and has actually lasted a month or more now.
I had another Oxon can opener but I found it hard to grip tightly enough to use.
This became an issue as carpel tunnel syndrome made my hands into hooks.
This can opener is much easier to grip.
It has a sharp blade that opens everything smoothly.
Now I no longer have to ask my son for help opening my cans.
Hopefully this will be the last can opener that I'll ever need.
Has heavier weight and feel that comparable openers at the big box store.
For those cans without a pull tab, this product makes opening a snap.
VERY PLEASED, THIS STRAINER FITS MOST BOWLS OR POTS AND DOES EXACTLY AS AMERICA'S TEST KITCHEN SAID--THANKS GUYS---BUY IT  YOU'LL LOVE IT TOO.
I am happy with the quality of this strainer.
But its volume is a shade or two too small for easy, general use.
Strainers are kitchen utensils that one needs at inopportune times.
Then I end up with a lumpy mess unless I have a strainer (or cheesecloth) on hand.
This OXO strainer is 6 inches across, so it is large enough to strain a pan of gravy without overflowing.
The mesh is a fine gauge, so the gravy will end up smooth.
This is a sturdy feeling little guy and I expect it to last for quite some time.
I bought this mainly to use for a pumpkin pie recipe.
The recipe said to strain a mixture of pumpkin and yams through the mesh strainer.
I will not lie, it was a pain.
But the mesh strainer was durable and easy to grip.
I laid it over a bowl, and it stayed steady while I strained the thick pumpkin mixture.
I think I pushed it's abilities to the max, but the important thing is, it held up.
Great purchase, I bought another one just to have on hand.
The 6&#34; diameter is a very nice size.
Would certainly buy another one and do recommend it.
How much can you say...it is a strainer.
Generally, I like this:  it looks nice, it feels nice, and it won't rust.
This one is only slightly smaller in diameter, but it holds about half as much.
When they measure it, they're counting the entire width of the fat metal rim as part of the strainer.
As a result, it's not useful for bulky jobs, like draining a pound of rigatoni.
I've got two different hanging racks, and neither type of hook works.
This strainer has seen heavy use and has held up well over the years.
Strainers are kitchen utensils that one needs at inopportune times.
Then I end up with a lumpy mess unless I have a strainer (or cheesecloth) on hand.
This OXO strainer is 8 inches across, so it is large enough to strain a pan of gravy without overflowing.
The mesh is a fine gauge, so the gravy will end up smooth.
A lot of our kitchen accessories are made by OXO.
We like the grips more than anything else.
We only regret not having purchased the complete set of strainers instead of buying one by itself.
I own almost all of the OXO steel gadgets.
But this one has kind of scary feeling when lifted by it's handle with something heavy, like it is going to brake on it's weld.
In this particular style of OXO, I own just about every utensil.
I have to say that I have yet to be disappointed!!  The handles are very comfortable, they are sturdy and dishwasher safe.
I am using it to cut and lift pizza and it does a great job.
They are exactly the same just a different grip  as you hold them.
I do think that it is the kind of spatula that you can have for years with only a little common sense maintenance.
I was in love with this item at first site.
This spatula, unlike the spoons, is just the right length.
The handle on this spatula is the perfect width for holding.
I love the rubber grippers OXO adds to the side of the handle.
The angle from the handle to the blade is the right angle to be able to flip food comfortably.
I bought this to use with a cast iron skillet that melted my favorite plastic spatula.
This has a nice even edge so it can get under the food with a clean quick wipe.
When done cooking,  I toss it in the dishwasher and it comes clean with no scrubbing and no fussing.
I have had to cash in on the lifetime warranty before and OXO was very easy to deal with.
They are a great company that takes good care of their customers.
What can I say? I'm a fan of this Oxo series and think it is well worth the money.
You'll have the spatula (excuse me, turner) forever.
i hate my plastic spatula and this was exactly what i needed.
product is perfect and i am glad i ordered it online.
The spatula is the right size and it does the job very well.
I have always found OXO's kitchen implements to be superior, and this stainless steel turner is no exception.
It is ruggedly made and very well designed.
It is also dishwasher safe, which is a huge plus.
Overall this is the best value for your dollar if you are in the market for a stainless steel turner!.
I recently purchased a new set of all clad stainless steel pots and pans, therefore I needed a metal spatula.
It works great and is easy to clean as well.
I have to admit after buying these OXO Good Grips Steel edition, I will never go back.
This is so true for the OXO Steel line.
What more can you ask of a spoon? :).
The rubber grip is smooth and comfortable to the touch and doesn't get too hot even when left in the pot/pan.
The spoon is sturdy and feels like it can take some abuse.
I'm trying to replace all the plastic in my house with glass or stainless steel to avoid the poison in plastics.
This spoon does a great job of holding a pile of food.
Stabs and holds food safely away from your hands while you carve away.
Purchased along with 8 inch Oxo slicing knife as a carving set.
Works well, comfortable to hold and serve with.
I almost bought a Good Grips meat fork with a rubber handle until I saw this one.
I love Good Grips kitchen tools, and have come to depend on the brand when I'm looking for a nice, solid, reasonably priced kitchen tool.
I'll definately be looking for more tools with this handle.
The fork itself is nice and sturdy, a good size, and handles well.
It was purchased for my daughter and she was pleased to receive it - sleek lines !  I would recommend it!.
Good quality from OXO that you've come to expect.
The slight curve on the tongs helps grip the food and avoid running into the blade.
With curved prongs and tips notched like fishing hooks, this 13-1/2-inch fork gets a solid grip on roasts, poultry, and big vegetables like baked potatoes.
It easily lifts a corned beef, for instance, from pot to carving surface and holds it down firmly for careful slicing.
Rather than being straight-sided, this tool's handle is tapered from heel to finger grip and has satin-finish, stainless-steel panels top and bottom.
The barbed tips prevent slipping of the meat or vegetables.
Use the OXO Steel Fork to retrieve and secure hot foods, or for hands-free serving.
It is very well-constructed not too heavy, but very versitile and handy in your hand.
Also, I use both forks for the bigger, bulkier meat cuts with confidence.
The fork is a bit more expensive, but the quality of this fork makes up the difference.
I use it to get items off of the BBQ grill surface without fail.
This is a very useful item.An epicurean Bon Appetite.
I like the whole SteeL series of utensils and this pork fits nicely with the bunch.
The fork does what it should; firmly holds the item being sliced.
It looks good, handles nicely and I'm very pleased with the solid feel.
I've only one warning for multitaskers - don't leave the fork standing in the roast you were slicing and walk away to do something else.
The fork and roast will be on the floor in a jiffy.
Though nicely balanced, the handle is long and weighty.
This is reasonably priced and a good choice for secure slicing.
I was surprised to find that these carving forks are impossible to find for sale on their own.
As everyone has mentioned, dishwasher safe is a big plus.
This product is for anyone who likes to cook.
it has a big handle (perfect of my hand).
The only thing is that the skewer fork is a little smaller than I expected.
Like the majority of Oxo products, this one is sleek, nice in the hand (good weight heft), and works as expected.
We own a lot of Oxo products and this one does not disappoint.
I like the OXO series of cutlery, and this is no exception.
For all your forking needs, this gets a big thumbs up!.
I purchased the fork, slotted spoon, ladle and 3 serving spoons and love all of them.
It feels great, it stabs great, it looks great.
I like OXO products a lot, but this one has missed the mark a bit.
The handle is very comfortable to hold; very large and chunky, with rubber grips.
The tines are nice and sharp, and a good length.
The weight is good, it feels sturdy.But the problem with it is where the handle joins the stem (if that is the correct word).
This is a 2-part fork, and the main problem is that the stem is quite thin.
I think when it does break (not if, it is definitely going to break) I will be looking for a sturdier replacement.
I would have given it 3 stars, but it hasn't broken yet so it still gets the benefit of the doubt.
I would highly recommend this large skewer fork for anyone who is in the market for one.
I love the barbed ends and the comfortable handle.
Well made and has provided taste soup, stew and chili from the kettle to bowl with charm and good looks.
The only negative is the handle somehow feels too big or chunky in my hand.
This is the first of several OXO SteeL utinsels I ordered, and I'm very eager to receive the rest of them too.
It's with great pleasure that my old mismatched tools will be sent to live at Good Will.
This ladle fits in with the rest of the tools I picked up.
I own the extire oxo steel line and am pleased with all the products under this line.
They all perform their function well and with style.
And they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle/fins.
It has a good handle weight, but the spoon is very big.
I bought the ladle, sloted spoon and 3 serving spoons and they are all great.
OXO have great products and I haven't found anything they make that I haven't liked.
The bowl of it is shallow but wider than some many of the ladles out there.
Good quality construction and the handle is really nice.
I just wish it was an inch longer so my hands stay a bit further from the heat of a hot pot/stove.
For the most part, I am very happy with this ladle--construction and quality are very good.
I was surprised, however, by how large the bowl of the ladle is.
Because it is so large, it is difficult to store in a drawer and it takes up a bit of space in the dish washer.
I don't have room on my counter top to have a utensil bin; therefore, it has to be stored in a drawer.
I have had other pieces for as long as I can remember and they still are in the same shape as I bought them.
Great grip and perfect addition to my kitchen collection! :).
This little utensil is made of heavy duty stainless steel.
I use this for a lot of purposes around the kitchen.
Aside from skimming foamy debris off of meat stocks, this tool comes in handy when extracting dumplings and pasta from boiling water.
It also use it when I make fried ravioli, mini egg rolls or any type of small food that is fried or poached.
It is stainless steel, nicely constructed, and has a hole in the handle so I can hang this from my tool rack.
It has an ample skimmer with plenty of drain holes that make it functionl and easy to use.
I have several Oxo SteeL implements and love them all.
They are very sturdy, wash well, and do their job.
They are the right size for the job and have comfortable handles.
I love this one and all of my Oxo SteeL implements.
Unlike a slotted spoon, the holes are just right for skimming soup, picking up foam.
But it also works as a slotted spoon, retrieving  all bits of importance.
This should last for many years to come.
I typically like OXO products, and I needed a steel spaghetti server, so I thought I'd give this one a try.
However, I was a little disappointed with this particular utensil when I first received it in the mail, as it's fairly light weight.
The jury is still out on this product though, as I want to see how it holds up over time.
I got the wholeOXO Good Grips 15-Piece Everyday Kitchen Tool Setand just added the steel spaghetti serve to finish on the set.
The quality of OXO is wonderful and I love the way they fill in your hand.
Does what it's designed for and goes well with my stainless & black kitchen appliances.
This is a good product and OXO has done well by me over the years.
This spaghetti strainer is solidly built and feels good in hand.
It will likely provide years of good service.
I love this utensil! It's perfect for the times when I'm lazy and not wanting to drain pasta.
This is a great handheld, impromptu strainer; it's a great server overall.
What can you say, it serves spaghetti!  It's stupid to require a certain number of words to explain why a spaghetti server is good.
Does it's job well just like the other SteeL utensils.
Seems sturdy and well built as far as I can tell.
I can't imagine any amount of spaghetti bending it.
I always had plastic ones of these before.
They would either accidentally get laid down on a hot surface and melt, or just bend and break from trying to scoop thick heavy stuff.
It's just a high quality kitchen utensil and I highly recommend it for someone who is fed up with the cheap ones.
I will never need to buy another one of these again.
I lived without one for a few months.
My life has improved with this spaghetti server.
Just a little too big for my taste.
No problems at all to report thus far, I am happily pleased with it.
I got a whole set of OXO kitchen utensils.
I was a bit disappointed to find these are stamped steel with rough edges.
Not rough so much that they would cut you, but rough as in not a nice smooth high quality feel.
But I will say the rough edges actually work a little better for this particualr use of grabbing noodles.
I use often and do love the metal to hold up better than what I had before.
The hole in middle helps to get more water away from the pasta.
I really like this brand and it doesn't disappoint.
the weight of the handle is great and the size of the spoon is as well.
A little too big for my tastes, but I really like it.
It is beautifully crafted out of stainless steel and is nice and solid without feeling too heavy or too light.
My daughter asked for a metal pasta server.
I had not heard of one but I went on the search and found that were in fact quite a few different kinds of them.
I decided on this one as I liked the look of it and I picked the right one.
She said the handle was one of the better featured on it as it offered insulation from the heat.
I am just glad I found the spoon that she wanted and she is very happy with it.
I might even be getting one for myself.
I don't think for the price you can beat any of the Oxo kitchen implements.
I bought this to replace a plastic, old spaghetti server I had.
Definitely an upgrade from what I had because it's durable material and easy to use and clean.
It is a well constructed product and I love that it is dishwasher safe.
Best way to serve lasagna!  Very sturdy a cuts nicely through 4 layers.
Obviously can be used for other foods, but this is just the right size and the only thing I use for that special dish!.
I lost my first one while moving after owning it for about 5 years.
I'm about 2 years into my OXO Steel Lasagna Turner #2.
I have thought about buying a bunch more in case they ever stop making it.
Highly recommend for any kitchen!  Also handy for scooping choppedherbs into the pot!.
Sure had not yet been used to &#34;turn lasagne&#34;.
OXO Steel 59891 Lasagna TurnerSuperb quality, good feel.
I would like more stiffness in the "blade" for flattening 'burgers.
It's a very good size for general use (a more useful size, I think, than most turners or spatulas).
beware you too might get attached to this simple thing.
I saw mine  at a store and then ordered on amazon:).
I use it for a whole host of things including when I need a small spatula.
It's not good for larger jobs or grilling, but for most other things it is perfect IMHO.
I had an old wood handle spatula like this which finally wore out.
I searched several brands and chose this due to price and customer reviews.
It feels good in my hand and is great for when I'm making a small pizza to take off the pan if the pizza sticks.
I also use this to cut and serve my desert bars that I make in my glass baking pans.
It is small enough to lift out bars and cake from a regular cake pan.
It flips eggs well too if you've got stainless steel pans.
Has all sorts of uses and good quality typical of OXO.
I have been looking to replace a 40-year-old spatula for quite some time.
I wanted a flexible, thin, yet sturdy surface.
This is just what I was looking for.
The blade is thin and flexible, yet holds up under weighty foods.
I am very happy to have found it!.
I've many OXO products and add this item to them.
This spatula has a comfortable feel in the hand, easily held, easily used.
All in all, I highly recommend this item.
I needed a tool for cutting into a tray of lasagna & found this one.
I bought two - one for my daughter, one for me.
This is one of my favorite kitchen tools.
It has a nice thin edge that is plenty sharp for cutting into a tray of lasagna, but not sharp enough to cut your fingers.
I highly recommend this tool to anyone who needs to cut into a tray of food.
I just love it.It works the way I wanted it to and picks up all that needs to be picked up.
I actually use this to serve sheet cake most of the time.
It works great and is rigid enough that you can slide it right under the cake.
It works well for scraping up heavier meal items in a flat bottom pan too.
No rust after a lot of use and dishwasher time.
I was using a knive and a cake turner (those triangle shaped ones) and upgrading to this was a great decision.
Now serving lasagna is easy from the very first piece.
I love the big handles, easy to grab and hold on to if your hands are wet or greasy.
I bought this for a cast iron skillet.
It ended up being the my favorite spatula.
I use it for everything...hamburgers to hash browns.
When done cooking,  I toss it in the dishwasher and it comes clean with no scrubbing and no fussing.
I have had to cash in on the lifetime warranty before on a different OXO product and OXO was very easy to deal with.
They are a great company that takes good care of their customers.
Can't use on my teflon pans, but so worth having for brownies, etc.
Like other OXO products, the OXO STEEL LASAGNA TURNER is a high-quality kitchen tool.
It is made of heavy-gauge stainless steel, has a solid, comfortable-to-hold handle, and is built to last a lifetime.
Unlike theOXO SteeL Pie Server, it won't double as a portion-cutting tool.
However, it is an excellent wide spatula that is flexible but still stiff and sturdy enough to pick up and serve heavier foods like lasagna.
The flat "blade" of the server measures 2-1/4" wide by 4-1/4" long.
I use this with my cast iron cookware.
It is of good quality and the handle is a great size in my hands.
It has held up well scraping my griddle clean after use too.
I bought this spatula to use with my cast iron pieces and I love it.
By mom has one of these stocked in her kitchen and figured I could use one.
The hardest part about this product is finding the name &#34;lasagna turner&#34; vs.
The best part about this device is the angle between where you hold it and the surface touching the pan.
The metal is good quality, easy to wash, no complaints here!.
I am a very very VERY picky person when it comes to spatulas.
it works for literally everything because of its length and width and ease of the shorter handle to maneuver! GET IT!.
It has just the right amount of flexibility and is just about the perfect size.
First, it is made in China, so Oxo should pass some of their savings on to us customers.
Second, water can get into the handle, causing corrosion over time.
One of my previous spatulas broke just inside the handle last week, so I am having to replace it.
I like the weight of the handle and the turner is a great proportional size.It does the job!.
After 3 hours of preparation and cooking, you hate to see your masterpiece destroyed at the critical moment.
By the way, it works fine for lots of other tricky dishes, including the always hard-to-handle 6 layered chocolate doberge (N'awlins' std birthday) cake.
We use this with our cast iron pan.
It feels great to use this and works really well on cast iron.
Have had only five months but expect it will last many years.
Another well made Oxo item, billed as a lasagna turner but can be used for many chores.
I have no idea why this is called a lasagna turner.
I like it that this is really strong.
(Actually one of these did break off after a couple of years' use, but now I see that they have a lifetime guarantee.).
Like other Oxo stainless steel spatulas, this one is excellent.
It has just a little rubber/silicone to make the grip comfortable.
Perfect for serving things out of trays (like prepared foods from Costco) or from pyrex or metal pans.
Maybe a little large for serving brownies unless you like really big brownies.
I like the shape, the way it handles, the size, and even the cost.
I use it for lasagna and cake and anything I can use it to scoop out things.
I don't use it for cooking but that's not what I bought it for.
I bought it for serving, so thumbs up for that and its pretty too.
I use this with my cast iron cookware and it does a great job keeping the cooking surface smooth and clean as I'm cooking.
I bought this and have been using it on an almost daily basis for about 2.5 months.
The white and black looks chic, the rubber base helps hold the bowl down so things are not splattering all over the place.
The size is enough for a family size batch of pancakes, or for washing a few cups of rice.
The plastic is very durable and it does not stain.
I have used spices and oils in it, but no stain...the tip of it is perfect for pouring.
its a really great and durable product, well worth the price :).
I put together a waffle making set for my grandson, who loves waffles and wanted to be able to make them.
He loved the gift and his family loves being the recipient of homemade waffles!.
This has it all, the rubberized bottom the spout and easy to clean --- wonderful.
This was not imagined by me ahead of time to be that big.
This bowl is terrific for gripping the counter top.
I bought one for its spout and handle and discovered it was ideal for my single-handed niece.
She can prop it securely on the counter with one arm and mix stiff cookie dough.
The high sides reduce slopping and the pouring spout depth helps determine where the mix will go even if the angle is steep.Terrific design!.
I bought two of these bowls to replace two other bowls that were left behind during a military move.
Washes easily with soap and butter and can be used to remove termites from hairy dogs also.
Can also be used in hundreds of other ways too numerous to mention.
Washes easily with soap and butter and can be used to remove termites from hairy dogs also.
Can also be used in hundreds of other ways too numerous to mention.
Love it, love it, love it! I didn't buy it until I read every single review and decided I had to try it.
My husband refuses to mix in any bowl but that one so I constantly have to wash it out to get a turn! Awesome.
i have steel bowls, ceramic bowls, glass bowls, copper bowls, melamine bowls, pinch bowls, finger bowls.
these OXO bowls are workhorses easy to hold and clean.
I have the whole set, 5qt., 3qt., and 1 1/2 qt.
Not the color of my choice, but I'm willing to overlook that for all of the great features.
I can continue using my favorite metal fork for mixing all of my kitchen creations and the non-skid base is a really great feature.
I can mix my muffins up and then pour directly into the muffin pan from the pour spout on the bowl.
They've been through the dishwasher a few times already and always come out clean with no stains.
I like the spout for ease of pouring and the rubber grip as well.
My old glass bowl was heavy to pull out for everyday use & the smaller one didn't have a lip to pour from.
This is the one that I bought, to go with the three piece bowlset...well...its the same size as the large one in the 3 pc.
This is a GREAT bowl to have in my kitchen.
It holds a substantial amount for mixing, won't shuffle all over the counter, and has a great grip to hold onto.
I find more uses for it all the time!.
I don't have any complaints about this product yet, but I've only been using it for the past couple months.
I love the rubber bottom to keep it from sliding.
It is great that this is made out of plastic to keep it light-weight and relatively shatter-resistant (vs.
The greatest feature is the rubberized bottom which prevents the bowl from easliy slipping on the counter while mixing.
It's easy to get every last drop out of the bowl and into the bake pan.
Common result: Mixing bowl slips and slides (maybe even off the table or counter).Solution: OXO mixing bowls.
The bottom of the bowl is coated with OXO's grippy-stuff.
It holds ITSELF in place (for most tasks).
This bowl is very nice to work with I need to probably think about getting the smaller one also.
It's light weight and makes it easier to pick up with one hand when you need to use the other to scoop with.
If you're familiar with Oxo products, you know how good the quality is and this bowl is no different.
I love that it stays put, even when using an electric mixer.
The lip is helpful for pouring out batter too.
This is a very comfortable bowl to use.
Made of sturdy plastic, it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls, which makes it convenient and easy to use.
The rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it - no sliding.
I use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it.
Oh, by the way - it's dishwasher safe, too.
I've washed mine over and over and it still looks new.
If you are going to get just one mixing bowl for your kitchen, just get the OXO.
The bowl is easy to wash, and is a real winner.
The non-stick bottom and handle to this bowl make mixing so much easier.
On my countertop, and water makes the bowl slip.
But the gripping bottom on this bowl resists slipping, making mixing easier.Unlike some other bowls, this one also has a non-stick handle.
This mixing bowl is all it's advertised to be.
It sticks to counter so it doesn't slide around when you use your hand held mixer in it.
I highly recommend it to anyone needing a mixing bowl that stays put.
I have previously bought a steel mixing bowl from Oxo in the past but did not like using a metal whisk on steel.
This one also has a lip to poor the mixture which I didn't even realize when I purchased it.
I think very good for using a hand mixer.
They have the rubber side that you grip, and the substantial rubber-like base that really holds the bowl firmly against the table.
IT does not appear to me that the rubber base will separate from the bowl (a good thing).
Bowl itself is solid, substantial plastic that appears to be durable quality material.
And the grip is nice, a nice way to hold the bowl while mixing.
I expect that you will want all three sizes after purchasing one size.
It is stable when mixing and easy to clean.
I received one years ago for a wedding present and we loved it so much we bought a second one.
I think we may purchase at least 2 more, since my hubby cooks so much and we are always washing the two we have.
I was fixing to do some mixing in my kitchen one day.
I grabbed this bowl, tossed in some ingredients and went to town.
I'll make an album of my mixing songs.
This bowl has been with me through pastries, salads, guacamole, and mashed potatoes, and everything between.
There's nothing really special about it other than the non-slip lining on the bottom of the bowl that does come in handy on slick surfaces.
Lip is convenient, too.My only real qualm is that it doesn't repel oils very well.
Sometimes I'll toss something in olive oil or use a butter-heavy receipt in baking and the oil just sticks to the walls of the bowl.
With most of my other bowls, some metallic some plastic, I simply rinse and it's ready for a new food.
This bowl is great! I bought two bowls in this series, and I use them for everything.
A ton of baking goes on in our household and this bowl is a HUGE hit.
I swear there is a coating that makes even dried on messes come right off.
No scrubbing.-Very good looking and fit well with our kitchen decor.The only annoying thing about these bowls is that they are not dishwasher safe.
Oxo Good Grips 5-quart Mixing BowlThis one of my most versitile bowls as I use it a lot in the course of cooking.
It is the right size for larger pieces of meat of a larger quantity.
You can cover the meat with the marinating liquid and store in the refrigerator over night and you are ready to go the next day.
The 5-quart bowl is ideal for doubling recipes or mixing larger quantities.
The Mixing Bowl features a non-slip wrap-around base that prevents skidding, even when the bowl is tilted.
A comfortable, non-slip handle gives you a firm grasp for easy whisking and stirring.
The wide lip and spout makes pouring neat and clean.
I use a plastic wrap or foil to cover the dish and it stores the leftovers well.
I found that in a pinch they survive light use in the microwave, and this gives this set a distinct advantage over Oxo's stainless bowls.
The bowls are also very easy to clean.
This bowl is the right size for any yeast dough as it gives it plenty of breathing room for it to raise.
I'm very pleased with this bowl.An epicurean Bon Appetite.
I purchased 3 of these bowls, two as a gift to a MD patient that has control and weight issues.
Its as if this system was designed for those with disabilities and the rest of us get to enjoy the benefits too.
If only it came with a lid!  Like the prep bowls do.OXO Good Grips 4-Piece Prep Bowl Set with Lids.
Nice size and easy to hold on to.
This has worked out perfectly for making waffles.
I have to make a double recipe, so the size comes in handy.
It cleans up in the dishwasher just fine also.
Alternatively, I use this bowl for making jello, and then is when I really appreciate the pour spout.
The rubber bottom keeps it from traveling all over the place and the pouring spout keeps the batter where you aim it.
This bowl is well made, easy to clean, and stays put while you mix with one hand.
It has multiple uses, and a must have in any kitchen.
I ordered another set to keep on hand.
I have the big one at home and I am buying another one to use up here in the "country".
Just take decent care of it and you'll have it forever.
These are the best mixing bowls I have ever had.
I have made tomato base products in mine and they have never stained.
They wash up like a dream.Forget stainless and glass bowls, these are the absolute best in mixing bowls.
Using the handle it is easy to lift with one hand.
The shape lets you easily hold it to mix.
Easy to get all the contents out -- much easier to scrape down the sides that with a traditional bowl.
Ilive the grip, pouring spout, size and how it is made.
I was concerned that this bowl would move on the surface when I mixed my stiff cookie batter.
a metal whisk scratches the plastic (I use a metal whisk for every baking task except measuring, separating eggs and kneading).2.
relatively shallow, so more to clean up afterward.
also, if I put my arm around the bowl, the ingredients spill.good points:it's big.
rubberized bits are helpful.conclusion:I'll use it for tossing/sifting ingredients, or holding larger quantities.
I'm impressed and had a heck of a time keeping my kids from stealing it from me on their last visit....They can order their own.
I have a Tupperware bowl that is ancient and worn that is the oerfect bowl for mixing anything and everything.
I always keep an eye out for a replacement.
One day at work a close friend was complaining her favorite bowl was about to bite the dust.
I bought two of these one for her and one for me.
NOT sorry!  Almost same size and shape but actually improved with non skid bottom and side grip.
This bowl has a nice weight to it, doesn't slide around on the counter, and has a soft comfortable grip.
I have this bowl and the smaller one.
The rubber base really helps the bowl stay put.
I was them in the dishwasher without any problems.
Like the companion 5qt (and 3qt if we could find one in stock LOL), this is an excellent bowl to have.
The non-skid base and handle really make this product special.
Thus far, these have held up very well to the wear of the beaters.
The bowl does just what they claim - it stays put while I am using it.
OXO's five-quart mixing bowl is an excellent product and an excellent value.
I have a lot of OXO products and have been very pleased with the utility, durability, and affordability of them all.
The bowl is not microwave safe, and being plastic, may not be ideal for some uses at high temperatures.
The bowl is a bargain, is lightweight, and has lots of handy features.
I like it so much I'm going to get the three-quart bowl too, as the five-quart bowl is larger than I need for many applications.
As with any OXO product, it is difficult to grasp the outstanding effort put into anything OXO produces.
Ask almost anyone who uses a kitchen on a regular basis, the most ubiquitous name in their culinary area is OXO.
The care OXO takes in design is obvious and the materials involved are superior in every way.
The engineering designs seem to be given heart by those involved at the plant and they share in OXO's demand for excellence and customer satisfaction.
This amounts to more than simple pride in their job.
It is a community spirit that fills the entire OXO mission with a zeal unmatched in the industry.
OXO strives to be the very best, of course, but there is an awareness of how lives are touched through their products as well.
And  that is what you purchase with anything in the OXO Good Grips line of products.
The OXO Good Grips 5-Quart Mixing Bowl is certainly no exception and you can rest assured of your complete satisfaction - it's OXO!.
This mixing bowl is a good size for most any task.
Its easy to use and clean up is easy.
This mixing bowl has a good grip on the side perfect for whipping ingredients and is extremely sturdy.
It also cleans very well and is durable.
I've owned and used several sizes of these bowls for the past two years.
The ergonomic design with the rubber grip makes these especially easy to use.
I'm probably not supposed to stick them in the microwave, but I do, and this gives this set a distinct advantage over Oxo's stainless bowls.
The bowls are also very easy to clean.
Nice large mixing bowl and it really grips the counter.
I prefer stainless steel but haven't found one with the gripper bottom yet.
These bowls are an extraordinary value - I did a double-take when I saw the price.
And of course the best feature is the rubberized bottom.
Just pour the batter right onto the griddle.Because the bowls are deep, they don't take up tons of room in the fridge.
I think that every kitchen should definitely have both sizes of this wonderful bowl! You'll love them!.
The rubberized bottom and well designed handle and pouring spout, make mixing a breeze!.
OXO makes really nice equipment and I find myself wishing more of my kitchen of my gear was made by them.
The no-skid bottom is absolutely fantastic and keeps the bowl put for heavy stirring or using a hand mixer.
The plastic itself is very sturdy and I haven't had any issues in the dishwasher with it.
Get it, it's worth the price for sure.
This is a deep bowl that is lightweight, yet sturdy.
And, the black rubber base prevents it from slipping while one is mixing.
The handle is a nice touch, too, when emptying the bowl.
The wide lip gives good grip for pouring, and it cleans easily.
The variety of sizes covers all my needs.My only gripe is that they didn't make a cover for it.
If there was an airtight cover, shaped to fit, I'd buy it and throw out all my other mixing bowls.
My only real quibble is that I'd have preferred another color.
Not just because I like blue or red or yellow, but because white stains so easily.
[Edited to add:  After quite a few months worth of use I can now say that this bowl even resists staining by tomato sauce.
Yup, that most potent of staining agents seems to hold no power over this white plastic.
Color me seriously impressed, and for that, I award the fifth star!]However, I can't fault the bowl for usefulness.
In fact, I originally bought it for a friend, decided that I liked it too much to give away, and bought something else for her.
It's good and deep so you can mix a lot in it before it starts to spill over.
In fact I forget sometimes and try to push it away only to have it stick stubbornly to wherever I've set it.
The handle - what a great idea for a mixing bowl! - also has a non-slip grip for use with wet, oily or floury hands.
And the pour spout is an inspired addition.
If you have room for only one mixing bowl in your kitchen, this one will do you.
I bought the 4 quart first and loved it but it was too large for some things so ordered this one and just adore it.
It's the perfect size to mix my little salads in, pancake batter, meat loaf..you name it and it fits..the small things.
Love the non-slip bottom, the handle, the pouring spout, the high sides..everything about it and nothing but praise here.
I purchased both this 2 quart bowl and the 4 quart bowl.
They are an improvement over the standard glass or metal bowls that I use to have.
Not a big issue, I have enough storage space, but it would be nice to have a stacking feature.
Also, another color other than white would be nice.
Even with these two small issues, I will purchase more of these bowls for myself and as house warming presents.
The non-stick bottom and handle to this bowl make mixing so much easier.
On my countertop, and water makes the bowl slip.
But the gripping bottom on this bowl resists slipping, making mixing easier.Unlike some other bowls, this one also has a non-stick handle.
Easy to use, stores nicely, cleans easily, pours reliably.
what more could you ask?  Best I've ever owned.
I bought both the two and the four quart bowls.
The OXO design department should sweep the international awards for design excellence anyway, but these bowls are over the top.
They are by far the most useful bowls I have ever encountered.
The clever handle, and rubberized non slip bottoms add enormous utility to the age old bowl.
I just hope OXO expands the line with even larger sizes.
I bought this for my wife a few months ago -.
It makes a great bowl for popcorn when you're watching a movie or other TV fare.Can't go wrong here!.
I have been married over 38 years and I have NEVER had a bowl like this one.
I use it and the 4 qt for EVERYTHING.
I just love them both.The rubber sides and bottom are a wonderful idea.
And the handle is the best idea ever.
If you have not tried one of these bowls, you must!.
I have this bowl and the larger one.
The rubber base really helps the bowl stay put.
I was them in the dishwasher without any problems.
I own both the 2-Quart and 4-Quart bowls.
And of course the best feature is the rubberized bottom.
Just pour the batter right onto the griddle.Because the bowls are deep, they don't take up tons of room in the fridge.
I think that every kitchen should definitely have both sizes of this wonderful bowl!  You'll love them!.
The rubberized bottom and comfortable handle on this bowl make it a pleasure to use.
It is light in weight and easy to clean.
My interst was piqued by this model, for it combines good looks with a lot of basic fnctionality, something the average Brit would appreciate.
This then, would be a good choice.That much said, this kettle has a lot of quality built into it.
It has a removable lid, which is wide enough to be able to empty and fill easily.
It has a 2-quart capacity, and is ergonomically designed to fit one's palm comfortably.
The handles are slip-proof--wet or dry--as well as dishwasher-safe.
All i all, this is a great tea kettle, and one I am sure will meet your needs for years to come.
This is one of the best little tea kettles you'll ever find:  it looks great, sounds great, and functions quickly and effectively.
Either way, the handle gets extremely hot and I couldn't use without an oven glove.
I should have asked the owners why they were selling, it didn't occur to me.New Review:I contacted OXO and told them of my issue.
I have the red enameled version, and have had it for about a month.
It gets used 2-4 times a day, every day.
The whistle works well - loud enough to be heard, but not obnoxious.
The lid fits well, and I haven't had any problems with steam sneaking out, nor have I had a problem with the spout dripping.
I compared this with several other products before buying, including kettles by Calphalon and All Clad, and have found this to be the best.
I like the handle, both because I don't need a potholder to lift it, and because it's a one-handed operation.
When you lift the handle, the cap on the spout flips open.
It's easy to fill, and heats up relatively fast.
The first one had a plastic lid, which broke within a few months.
I called Oxo, and they sent a replacement kettle, and had wonderful customer service.
The 2nd we liked very much, but it was involved in a VERY minor stove fire.
This caused the enamel to flake off and seriously discolored the kettle.
We replaced it with another Oxo model, only because hubby was not crazy about the mechanics of it.
When full, the spout would tend to open from the weight of the water while transferring from sink to stove.
Some of the newer Oxo models have corrected that problem.
Lifting this teakettle by the handle opens the pour spout.
No button to press or gadget to fiddle with to open the spout.
Actually the angle you hold the pot at determines whethere the spout will open or not.
It will always be open when in the &quot;pour&quot; position.
In the more &quot;level&quot; carrying position just a tilt of the angle will change it from closed to open.
It may sound kind of strange or uncontrollable, but it is very easy to manage.It's made of sturdy stainless steel.
It looks nice, though very sleek and modern compared to all those &quot;cute&quot; teakettles out there.
I personally think the sound is more &quot;musical&quot; than the older whistling types.
You cant put this kettle on high heat due to the rubber handle.
Until now, I have been able to use NO other teakettle.
All the other teakettles I have seen (and tried) require more dexterity than I have.
(I am a C5/6 incomplete quadriplegic, if you need to know).
OXO products provide long lasting quality and fine styling.
Individuals can be confident when purchasing OXO products concerning the fine grade and value.
I've used the OXO Good Grips teakettle for about 10 years.
Although they sometimes have problems (the lid on one separated into parts), it generally is an easy-to-use, good quality kettle.
It will discolor if you heat it up without water or let the water boil out of it, so caution is necessary.
The whistle is loud and you'll always hear it (sounds like a train whistle).
This inexpensive set is generally useful around the stove.
Holds up to heat and is easy to clean.
For the price, you really can't beat 'em.
This is a pretty nice spatula, but not the best that I've owned.
The edges are a little thick and beveled, so you don't get a reeeaally clean scrape on a curved bowl.
But, it does the job for the most part!.
Great for my baking and kitchen needs, mixing and scraping.
We love this spatula, does exactly what it should and cleans up beautifully.
Seems to be very well made, as well.
I like these colorful tools for cooking with higher temps than most plastic utensils can take.
The colors are cool and fun and they work great.
I have heavy spatulas that are restaurant quality and I like these better.
The sizes are convenient to work with, not huge and awkward.
My spouse is in culinary school, so we go through a lot of different kitchen implements.
When it comes to spatulas, this is our mutual favorite.
Although we've since bought extras, our first one -  purchased back in 2006 - is still going strong.
It's not stained or warped or otherwise damaged.
These are great for a wide variety of cooking and baking needs.
They are easy to clean with the detachable heads and they can stand up to the head of my cast iron pots as well.
I love these, they are a great investment!.
All the Oxo stuff I've bought has worked fine.
I have a bunch of their spatulas and they get lots of use.
Bought them for son's girlfriend and she loved them.
This spoon spatula is the first utensil I reach for when I'm cooking--no matter what I'm cooking.
I actually think the white has become a little stained, the red hasn't.
I have had no problem with the handle bending or breaking, and I like the fact that it doesn't move around in my hand.
I can get around the entire bowl in one stroke.
It really stays with the form of the bowl or pan.
Not sure what what kind of food other reviewers are trying to flip or stir, but I have flipped 12oz steaks with these no problem.
This set of spatulas is an excellent replacement for my 20-year-old Rubbermaid wood handled model that had gotten rock hard over the years.
These are just soft enough to get everything out of a mixing bowl or jar, but firm enough to fold batter or stir thick sauces.
I hope that over time they don't get loose.
GOOD TO HAVE DIFFERENT SIZES IN YOU KITCHEN.
LIKE THE LONG HANDLE AND DIFFERENT SIZES&#8230;WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS.GREAT SPATULAS.
I bought one of these and a regular red Oxo spatula, and I've found that I really don't need any others.
I've left these in a hot pot of alfredo sauce for half an hour (OOps!) and it came out completely unscathed.
Buy one regular red and one spoon shaped red Oxo spatula, and you won't need to buy any others!.
This is much smaller than I expected, but it comes in handy.
It's a welcome addition to my spatula arsenal, but you would not want this as your only spatula.
The handle is comfortable (as are all Oxo's) and it goes into the dishwasher.
Nice quality and wash up good in dishwasher.
From its appearance the product looked very sturdy, and the various colors will no doubt add color to her kitchen.
It arrived earlier than expected which was just in time for the shower.
I had a OXO Silicone spatula that I use day in and day out.
The red one that is symmetrical is perfect for cooking on the stove top.
The white one was to replace my old spatula.
I use it mostly while I bake, scraping off my mixing bowl and such.
It is not as soft and pliable as my previous one, even though they look completely identical, so I don't like it as much.
But I love the other two, and this set has a good variety.
Blades are flexible but with enough resistance they don't just bend over in the bottom of a jar or can.
I used it's BIG brother for years and thought I was buying the big one again.
It works as good as it's big brother but on a much smaller scale...LOL.
It is, like big brother, truly heat resistant.
I use it to turn thngs I'm frying all the time with no problems.
I highly recommend both the tiny one here and it's BIG brother.
The flexible rubber fins on the steel handle create a very comfortable feel and will NOT transport heat up the handle.
It can be used to stir the stiffist pancake mix and yet still clean the side of the bowl smooth.
I like any tool that keeps me from having to make another tool dirty.
Then I use this spatula (or the similar one with the straight blade) to scrape everything out of the food processor bowl.
Then I use the same spatula to stir the ingredients in the skillet or pan.
I have accidentally left this spatula in a kettle of stew for over 5 minutes.
Other plastic spatulas would have melted (I know from experience).
Will last forever, no more cheap spatula's for me.
I wish I had found them sooner.I would use these as a gift, they are that nice!.
I bought this set because they are heat resistant and I have some new EVAco/Cast pans I will be using them with.
Have gone through the dishwasher multiple times and are used for anything from cake batter to tomato sauce to stir fry--still looking like new.
I bought this to get over the limit for free shipping.
It works great for stuff like getting all the mustard out of the jar, or cleaning out a small plastic container.
It also works better than a regular dinner knife for spreading anything from mayo.
I use this tool all the time for small jobs.
We have multiple sizes from OXO including this one and they all clean well and I especially like that the ends come off to clean.
I feel confident I am working with a sanitary tool.
Highly heat resistant, flexible enough without being too flexible, overall a great spatula, and my go-to utensil for a lot of jobs.
I have several of the OXO spatulas and love how all of them perform.
They have become my favorite type and hold up well over time.
The handles make them very comfortable to use too.
NOt the cheapo stuff you get at the discount stores.
These worked really well and were great quality! Get them for your kitchen!.
I like to use it for scrambled eggs.
It is sturdy and handles high heat very well.
I have left it in the pan for a minute or so before and the material doesn't melt.
I am very happy with this spatula set.
And for an OXO item - I feel they are very reasonably priced (at $12).
I do wish the green spatula were a little bit smaller for getting into nooks and crannies, but I can find one elsewhere.
These silicone spatulas are excellent quality and do a great job.
Yes, I highly recommend this purchase to anyone.
I have four of these, because I can't tolerate any other brand.
The handle stays cool, the construction is solid, and the colors are spunky.
They fit the hand well and are good quality for the price.
C'mon....It's a spatula and I like to cook;  I can't say much more than that!.
I have ordered several in this series, but this is the first that I have used.
Even for non coated pots/pans, this utensil can get down to the fire and come out like new.
It follows the contour of your pan without trying to scrape through to the burner, and makes it to the dishwasher unscathed.
Love the three size set in different colors.
So far, the silicone has not detached itself from the handle which has been typical of other brands purchased.
To my pleasant surprise, the white spatula has not discolored after many uses (including with tomato sauce).
Oxo Good Grips 3-piece Silicone Spatula SetOh how I love this set of spatulas.
I use them for all kinds of cooking situations, from meatloaf, cake batter, pancakes and waffles, to different dough recipes.
They work well and they fit into your hand like they were made for it, without slipping, even when your hands are wet.
The spoon spatula makes a great tool for stirring and scraping, even tasting.
The heads do NOT melt when exposed to the hot food.
Most of the newer pots and pans come with a non-stick coating and these spatulas work extremely well as they do NOT scratch the coatings.
Well made spatulas and very easy to handle for these old hands.
Handles are nice and firm, compared to others that I've have bought.
Everything that I have ever gotten from oxo is great quality and design.
One great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning.
My husband is the cook in our house and he tells me what he needs in the kitchen.
I like the old fashion wooden spoons when I make him cookies, etc.
but these are exactly what he needs for everyday cooking.
So glad they are heat resistant up to 500 degrees, don't have to worry about throwing them in the dishwasher.
I could get used to these real fast!  Good Value! thanks.
This spatula is the first I ever owned made of silicone.
It is marvelous for stirring hot food that tends to stick to the bottom of a pan.
You don't have to worry about it melting.
The tomato-red color is lovely, too, and the black handle very attractive.This makes a great Christmas, housewarming, or wedding shower gift!.
However, I wouldn't trade comfort for smaller handles.
Guess I'll just need to get a bigger jar or find a new place to put these :)Depends on your preference:-They are quite stiff.
I've bought several spatulas over the past 18 months trying to replace all of my old rubber ones which deteriorate with use.
I couldn't find any small ones locally though, which I really need for scraping the sides and bottoms of various jars and small bowls.
Since I have other Oxo products and love them, I thought I would try these.
All I can say is that I love them!  I bought two, one blueberry and this tomato one, and will be buying others soon.
They wash beautifully in the dishwasher and haven't picked up odors as rubber ones sometimes did.
I find that the graduated size is quite useful.
I loved getting the three different sizes all in one set.
They have been a great addition to my kitchen.
Wish this company would make one about half the length with a smaller head as that is a very useful size for so many things.
Cleans just fine and the color choices are good, got the Vanilla and the Red one.
These are much better spatulas than what I'm used to and work very well on the stovetop with non-stick cookware.
They seem to fare better when hand washed though as the dishwashing soap seems to leave a film.
I still prefer a flat edged wooden spoon for some stovetop applications like scraping cooked bits from the bottom of a pan.
This spatula set gives you three useful tools at a reasonable price.
Easy to clean, and the colored heads make them easy to find.
These are nice spatulas&#8230; easy to clean and well made.
I like the different sizes and the colors are pretty in my utensil crock on the counter.
This smaller spatula works well for smaller batches.
Also great as a jar scraper for smaller jars like peanut butter, jelly, etc.
Love the oxo spoon spatulas and have several of the.
They work great, don't break and clean easily in the dishwasher.
This is perfect for getting everything out of a can (like cream of mushroom/chicken soups).
The small one can be used to get the residual mayonnaise (or peanut butter, or jam, or whatever) out of almost-empty jars.
They are flexible without being floppy, durable without being too stiff.
I highly recommend them as an essential utensil for any kitchen.
My daughter and I each bought one of these spatula's last year, so I am buying her another one for this Christmas!  Great buy.
Life is too short for shabby spatulas! LOL ;).
Another great OXO product, the are very well made and super functional.
The can take a high heat no problem and are easy to clean.
I have had one of these for years and just ordered another one.
I like that the silicone bends a bit but not too much.
The the spatular is curved so it scraps bowls well.
Why other ones don't have this simple design is strange.
You know how most spatulas are, even the expensive ones.
They eventually chip, peel, discolor or are too stiff or too soft.
I didn't think I'd find anything better than my Rubbermaid but I did.
These are my favorite Spatula set that I bought from amazon.
They are nice and sturdy at the tips, the red one is the one I use the most.
I needed a new spatula to use in the kitchen.
I found that this size is very good and it works well.
Durable product with good design and ergonomic features.
Firm ergonomic handle allowing for good dexterity and leverage.
I like the matte finish of the OXO plastic, it doesn't look cheap and withstands scratches and chips.
From my experience other companies that use a gloss finish, their products seem to attract scratches leaving them to look expired before they really are.
I like my things, even my kitchen utensils, to look nice.
I would think that they industry would have solved that issue by now.
Got these for my husband for Christmas--the old Rubbermaids were wearing out.
This are really nice and I like the sizes and shapes.
I have a couple of the regular sized spatulas and three of the small ones.
I use the smaller ones so often I have worn a couple out.
They may eventually crack but this depends a great deal on how you use them.
Scraping food off the blades of a food processor will chip and chew the silicone up.
I lost one in the garbage disposal as a result.
I like to keep at least three around so I always have them.
They are very useful tools and they feel very good in your hand.
This is one of the most often used tools in the kitchen.
I really liked this spatula, the Tomato color made it easy to find in my kitchen utensil drawer.
I said "was", as after a year of frequent use the spatula head came off.
I couldn't use it after that, the spatula tip just wouldn't stay on, so it went to Kitchen Utensil heaven.
*cries*Perhaps it's because I washed it in the dishwasher?  It's possible, but I really want a spatula that can be put in the dishwasher.
These wash very well in the dishwasher and look brand new after cleanings - no stains left on the silicon.
The wider end of the handle makes for better griping, too.OXO is the best around.
I have all their products; some, I don't even know what they're used for, really - but I'm addicted because the products last for decades.
The iSi spatula heads are a lot longer than the head on these OXO small spatulas.
These are working out better for removing the food.
I am finding the small head useful for a lot of other kitchen tasks.
The raspberry and black color is quite beautiful.
Purchased 2 different Oxo silicone spatulas to fill-out my already burgeoning collection.
They are sized well and I like the colours.
OXO tools are pretty all I buy now.
These are the best spatulas ever! The tops don't fall off! The little green one is great,especially in a peanut butter jar.
I like the pink one for baking and mixing the ingredients.
i use them for everything in the kitchen.
The only negative was that it was smaller than I thought it would be.
It's bigger than the narrow jar ones but not as big as a standard sized spatula.
The handle is a little short but comfortable to hold.
I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting when I ordered it but I kept it because it works.
These spatulas have a nice feel to them.
You can scrape the side of your stainless steel bowls without worrying about scratches.
I didn't think I'd even need it but it comes in handy for reaching in those little jars!.
Purchased these as part of my wife's Christmas.
She loves them...they work very well for the things she uses them for.
OXO is a reputable brand, Amazon's price beat any retail price and I am not worried about continued disintegration of cheaper &#34;rubber&#34; products.
i learned a lesson!  but i'll stick with these--highly recommended.
Have had many spatula jsut brake or crack on me.
Have only broken one handle on this oxo model.
at first I thought this was a bit pricey, but, it's so sturdy & comfortable in your hand.
I really like these I bake a lot and my other spatulas gave out and these are wonderful id recommend them to anyone who bakes.
great spatulas so far; they haven't melted & go through the dishwasher fine.
I love all the widths & are good quality.
We love these OXO spatulas, especially this size.
It is very handy for clearing the last goodness out of peanut butter jars, for instance.
The only thing that caused us to buy a new one was that the old one got caught in a blender &#8230;Highly recommended!.
I've been using these for nearly 2 months now.
My sister even caught one on fire by leaving it too close to the flame on the gas stove.
After years of being the only one who will hand wash them, I finally sought out dishwasher safe silicone spatulas.
These work great, I really have no big complaints.
I just have my old williams sonoma spatulas to compare them too, and those were more flexible and overall a better silicone for cooking.
These are flexible (the white and green ones, not the scoop pink/red one), just not as much as I'd like.
The pink/red one is always spotty when it comes out of the dishwasher, but again, it doesn't hurt anything.
I was just hoping to be wowed by these due to the brand and reviews, and to me they're just fine.
These silicone spatulas are great not only for baking, but I use them for cooking as well.
The are firm, sturdy, and scrapes the sides of the baking bowls really good and clean.
They are easy to clean and diswasher safe.
I like that oxo is finally making some of their products in different colors.
This spatula is a nice size for mixing, and scraping smaller amounts.
The handle is comfortable,and the scraper head is a smooth silicone so it is very easy to clean.
I wish I had made this purchase long ago.
All the other spatulas in the house are now in the trash.
I like the way to handle feels in my hand, as the handle is rounded and substantial.
I use these for most of my jobs in the kitchen.
It stands up to heat, it is sturdy, it scrapes a bowl clean, is very easy to wash.
I purchase these for gifts for family members, I like them that much.
My daughter stole the red one and is holding it ransom for a whole set of her own.
This size spatula is great for getting the last bit out of jars or out of a yogurt cup or something like that.
This particular spatula has a solid handle and the white part is not too stiff or too soft to do its job.
I've only had it a few days, but so far, so good.
It made it through the dishwasher on the sanitary cycle okay, too.
good handles,sturdy.oxo good grips is the way to go on all things kitchen.
Great simple spatulas made to OXO quality standards.
Silicone ends can be removed from the handles for washing.
These match all my other OXO gear nicely!.
These spatulas are well designed, comfortable to hold and are great tools to have in the kitchen.
Reasonably priced, arrived on time and in one piece.
I was concerned that these or any others would be flimsy and cheaply built.
Very Nice, Very Well Built and Very Sturdy.
Sharp flexible edges for easy scraping and smooth body for less waste and easy cleaning.
The large handles are great and fit my hand for easy use.
I highly recommend them and are a good value for good quality kitchen tools.
I like this spatula I do, but if you are working with dough it is useless.
The spatula end is detachable--which I recommend when washing because bits of food can get stuck in the seam and inside the spatula tip.
I use it all the time.However with doughy mixes it is useless and I go back to the old wooden one.
The spatula tip just comes off and gets stuck in dough.
If it was one solid mold with no chance of detaching I would give it five stars.
I expected something a little larger, but this serves it's purpose well.
I have purchased other OXO products and they are all of excellent quality.
Contours well with my stainless steel bowls, clearing contents from the side with little effort.
The sizes are perfect for all types of cooking.
After the spatula I purchased from WalMart broke (snapped while trying to stir cookie dough), I was in the market for a new spatula.
As always, I first turn to Amazon to see what's out there.
I saw these, they got great reviews, and bought them.
They are strong, easy to hold, and clean up easily.
They are easy to grip and hold on to.
You may not know it yet, but you really do need these.
A good variety, these silicone spatulas are fantastically useful.
easy on the hands with well-sized handles, and different sized heads, they fit a wide range of uses.
When I first purchased this set of spatulas I thought them heavy and somewhat imbalanced.
However, after much use I adjusted to their &#34;feel&#34; in my hand while using and am very pleased with their functionality.
The heads of the spatulae (plural for spatula?) are very &#34;grippy&#34; - and they don't come off the handles, which is important to me.
I have several Oxo spatulas - they don't warp, bend, peel, discolor or melt - even if used to stir things in a hot pan.
So far, none of them have broken, and I have had several of them for a few years.
Good shapes and sizes, comfortable in your hand.
Only one concern is how these will stand the test of time.
The handles are not as sturdy as they look, but so far, so good.
It hasn't hardened from being put in the dish washer.
I find it really rather comfortable to hold.
I sent these to my daughter - seems she hadn't a single spatula (shock!).
Anyway.....I checked reviews and for the price this was a well received set.
Great size options and are really great quality.
The color are also really fun and liven up the kitchen a little bit.
I bought this to replace the exact same spatula that I already had.
I accidentally got mine nasty one day and couldn't use it for food anymore.
Oxo is a company that seems to know how to make a good product.
I have yet to replace anything from them.
I seem to use a lot when I bake so will order another set.
I have put these in dishwaser by accident and seemed okay.
But don't think I would keep that up.
This set had the 3 types/sizes I was looking for.
I like how the handle can be pulled off for cleaning but doesn't come off when using it.
I have also used this in pots and pans (to scrape sauces out, not while cooking) and haven't had a problem with melting.
I love OXO, and have a number of their spatulas and spoonulas.
I'd never seen this small one in stores - maybe I wasn't looking very hard.
It occurred to me that I needed one at this size - to get into smaller jars.
It works great, and I realize how much I was missing something like it in my kitchen arsenal.
It's size makes it easier to maneuver on spreading tasks, where its bigger brother isn't as nimble.
I wish it were cheaper, but the quality and utility make up for it.
Can't ask for more when you have style & function coming together.
Very durable, too! I'd totally buy these again.
Doesn't break down when washing them a few times.
This is the perfect starter set for home cooks.
Silicon flexible and wont get caught in the beaters of your mixer.
I use the small one mostly but used the large item for transferring stew to serving dish.
Easy to clean and can take high heat so no burning.
didnt know how helpful it would be until i got it.
I really haven't found many OXO brand items that I don't like.
They wash up beautifully in the dishwasher, and the various sizes make one of them good to use for Every situation I've encountered.
I haven't used these yet but they a good quality.
I never put my spatula's in the dishwasher and always hand wash so I am sure they will hold up well.
The sizes are good and close to comparison in photo.
This came in a package of three items.
The pastry brush, pastry cutter, and the pastry dough cutter.They have comfy handles and are a great addition to your kitchen.
This scraper/slicer for pastry items is ideal with a very rigid blade and comfortable grip.
But I wonder how long the stainless steel blade will remain so since it is another Chinese attempt at making a quality item.
For some reason they just cannot seem to get it right.
Ok, well that is exaggerating a bit but I loving having this board scraper around.
The handle is made of a rubberized type material and is still easy to grip even if your hands are wet.
It is very well made and has held up well to some serious use over the past couple of months.
I don't even use it for pastry because I am extremely gluten intolerance.
I use it to scrape all of the vegetables off my cutting board after I chop them.
I'm no longer picking up the cutting board and scraping them off with my knives, which is a lot easier on my wrists.
I have owned one (the same one) for about 15 years and I use it several times daily.
I sharpen it on a diamond stone every couple of years, it holds its edge well.
I wash it mostly by hand but sometimes in the dishwasher.
The hard rubber handle shows no sign of age.
I rounded the corners slightly to prevent gouging when I use it to scrape my wood cutting boards.
I scrape with the blade near perpendicular to the surface, bad for any blade but it holds its edge so hey.
It's not sharp enough to do any serious chopping, and not very ergonomic for that purpose either.
I use it for scraping and pastry work, and it works fabulous for both of those purposes.
I downgraded it a star because the handle is thicker than it needs to be and takes up unnecessary space in the drawer.
A thinner handle would make it 5 stars for me.
I've never used one of these before, always just a knife, but it is wondrous, making pie crust making simpler and easier.
First and only item of its kind I ever owned/bought, can't compare to anything else.
It is realy useful portioning the dough, scraping the dough from the counter, a lot better than the knife I previously used.
This makes picking up that dough or pastry so much easier, with out ruining it.
I had wanted one of these for a long time.
It makes work easiere when picking up a lot of chopped onions as well as other things.
Nice to use when making fondant for cakes on granite counter tops.
Haven't used it as a chopper but it divides fondant nicely and scraped up the dried on fondant from my counter tops.
That is what I use it for and I LOVE it!.
I haven't had a chance to use it yet but have run it through the dishwasher and seems good quality and sturdy!.
I use this product every day to scoop up my diced vegetables.
I don't know how I managed without it.
I know I lost a lot of tiny pieces of food to the floor.
OXO is a name that I equate with good products and I wasn't disappointed with this scraper at all.
This pastry scraper is very comfortable to hold.
I haven't used it for chopping, but it seems to be sharp and I think it would chop herbs well.
I'm not sure it would be sharp enough to handle anything too crunchy.
I mainly use it for cutting dough into sections and then moving the dough to other work surfaces.
I bought this to scoop all the cut up pieces on my cutting board.
I really like this chopper-slash-scraper but I haven't gotten in the habit of using yet.
I have a King Arthur Flour scraper and I prefer the OXO over it.
It is not sharpened at the angle of a regular knife blade; it is somewhat blunt-about a 70 degree, inclusive angle.
This still makes it a snap to pinch off dough.
It is also usefull for cleaning my wooden cutting boards or any flat surface you might want to scrape or collect bits off of.
The scale is a "bit of fancy" that some might find useful.
The handle is somewhat soft, and very well ergonomically designed.
It fits the hand and palm comfortably, unlike the KAF's wood handle (not to mention its totally blunt edge).
+ Great for transferring veggies/etc from cutting board to pot/pan/stove.+ Great build quality-Wish it had a hole for a lanyard/hanging stringOverall, awesome.
There is a ruler etched into the edge for measurements.
A little pricey for the OXO brand but you won't need another one.
I've never used anything like this before, but I've been using it more and more.
If you like to bake...a lot...you should seriously consider checking out this pastry scraper.
The "blade" is nice and sharp (but it won't cut you) and the handle is super comfortable.
It also seems to be very sturdily made and has handy measurements along its edge if you need them.
You know, when the recipe says to divide the dough into 2, 4, or even 16 pieces.
When you've just kneaded a pie crust and your counter is covered in sticky, floury dough, this is the bomb.
I use this to cut and pick up dough when I'm making bread.
The edge does a good job of scraping dough and flour off my board.
More efficient, easier grip, less tiring to the hand.
Perhaps not the thing to do if using a coated (non-stick) pan.
I've even used it to cut pizza when I couldn't find my pizza cutter (the wheelie thing).
Just very handy in the kitchen, cut, scoop, scrape, separate, etc.
Like most OXO products, it is really comfortable to hold.
Good product, and I like the ruler that is marked on the edge.
Love this item.Works great for Pastry Arts class.
I'm just a working guy that likes to cook home style meals like Grandma used to make.This scraper is of  good quality, heavy stainless steel.
I can slice my home grwon vine ripened tomatos with it.
I can trim and cut meats, I've cut baby back ribs, chicken breast and sirlion, I chop veggies, dice potatoes, it cuts pretty much anything.
My knife hasn't been out of they drawer since I got this.Buy 2.
You'll find this to be so useful, that like me, you'll want 2.I'm ordering 3 more, one more for me and 2 for friends.
I have nothing but good things to say about the products that OXO Good Grips makes, and this little baker's blade/dough cutter is no exception.
I purchased it for one reason:  to scrape my cast iron cookware.
It is easy to hold, it is durable, and the edge is true.
No kitchen is complete without one of these hanging around.
This scraper, like all Oxo Good Grips products, has excellent handle "feel", and is more comfortable than any others I have used to date.
It is made in China, so I'm not sure how long the perfect stainless-steel blade will remain stainless.Not perfect - but close!.
It chops veggies, it scoops, it cuts dough, it scrapes, it measures.
The handle is comfortable and fits nicely in the hand.
I use this to get the chopped product to the bowl.
I had been using the knife to do this but it is so inefficient.
The edge of this product is sharp so it can chop but I don't use it for that.
Another feature is the ruler along the edge; that is helpful for any recipe where size becomes important....like pie crusts!.
Sometimes a pizza wheel just doesn't cut, no matter how good it is.
I don't normally make pastries, but this is fairly versatile.
Use it to help pick up cut out cookies, pie crust, scrape dough and flour off the countertop.
It's nice and heavy and the handle doesn't feel like its hollow so it shouldn't get water inside.
This scraper is nice!  It's heavy gauge, great quality,  and sturdy.
I use it mostly for scraping up onions, and veggies off my cutting board, and it does the job perfectly.
Use it to portion dough and smooth frosting.
This from someone who hasn't had much luck with Oxo in general.
This thing has no moving parts, so reviewing it doesn't take 20 words.
It has the little ruler thing on it, which is kind of nice when cutting dough or something.
I don't know how I ever managed without this handy devise.
When I chop vegetables, I use it as the scoop to transfer them to the pot.
It has a small ruler along the cutting edge to make pastry layout easier.
It stores standing up along the edge of my drawer.
This simple item is just what you would expect.
It has too much packaging over it but is mostly a slice of metal with a solid handle.
You can get the same thing at lower prices by looking around.
I used this to cut the rolls on my homemade cinnamon buns.
It cut nice and smooth on the first try without smashing my rolls.
They came out perfectly cut, and the end result was amazing.
I also used to cut them after I finished baking so my husband could bring them to work and share with his coworkers.
It is a very sharp blade and I have no complaints.
Just be careful when using because it is VERY sharp.
This  item was so well- packaged, that there was no way it could have been damaged in any way.
This is not always the case, so I am so pleased that this company takes pride in its work.
The item is very well made and can be washed in the dishwasher.
Thank you for your superb product and packaging.
Been making a lot of bread lately and my plastic scrapers weren't doing that good a job.
soap mold and use this contraption to cut the soap once it becomes in a solid state.
Deep enough to do the job and very sturdy and sharp enough to do the job easily.
Feels good in my hand and had a little weight to it.
I have a lot of OXO products, they are well made and hold up to daily use.
This is a great tool for moving chopped veggies from cutting board to pan!.
Bought this for my wife, who loves to play with dough of various kinds.
I do like the fact it is big and sturdy, easy to scoop all of your chopped vegetables and put them right into the pan.
OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper/Chopper  is of good quality and so handy when making pies , pastry and crackers.
I had one but it just didn't quite meet my expectations.Any baker will be very please with this OXO Multi purpose scapper.
OXO Good Grips Scraper/Chopper this is a very nice item.
The handle itself is very easy to use and this is very well made.
I would certainly buy from OXO again and I do enjoying buying from Amazon since they started.
I cut 15lbs of dough a day and it has been perfect and stayed sharp.
wanted one off these for years  got one.
Not much to say other than this is a very high quality product; very hefty making it durable and long lasting.
This has been the best pastry scraper I have ever used.
I push the pastry 1/2 way onto the scraper and gently push it off onto the baking sheet, works wonderful.
The edge has a measure line on it also.
If you've been using a spatula to pry pastry off the board you've probably been tearing up as many pie crusts as you've made.
If not the bottom crust, then the top, it never fails.
This tool is wide enough and the blade thin enough to easily scrape up your pie dough each time and every time.
It also gives you the confidence to roll thinner dough.
Thin pie dough is flaky tasty pie crust.
The handle is solid and easy to grip I really like that the measurement numbers are engraved/etched permanently and NOT just painted on.
The blade itself, doesn't flex or bend at all, but is thick and sturdy.
It pretty much does it all!! Be sure to purchase a few to add to bridal shower gifts, too!.
I purchased the scraper/chopper to use in my kitchen for kitchen prep it will do the job for me just fine.
I would recommend it to anyone for quicker prep time in the kitchen.
It even has a ruler marks along the bottom that I had not noticed prior to ordering.
It chops and scoops things into the pot, it scrapes bread dough off the bread board or counter, and saves an enormous amount if time.
If you don't have one you don't know what you are missing.
It is a good, solid tool for novice or serious bakers.
It has a nice sturdy feel in ones hand.
The 1/4&#34; markings on the 6&#8221; blade are extremely useful since, when directions call for specific sized pieces, the markings save having to estimate size.
Further, because they are &#8220;engraved&#8221; into the blade&#8217;s surface, there is little danger of scrubbing off the markings.
If you bake frequently, the &#8220;OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper Chopper&#8221; will be a valuable addition to your baking tool collection.
bought for a gift and  it is better than mine.
Great little gadget.......OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper/Chopper...a necessity for any kitchen....I even bought extras for my kids!~ I recommend this to other viewers!`.
It not only makes scraping and scooping chopped veggies quick and easy but it helps keep a busy work area clean.
The measurement marks have proven useful as well when making biscuits or rolling out a pastry or tart shell.
It's comfortable and the edge is actually straight.
You would be surprised how many dough knives in this price range have really crappy edges because of a lack of quality-control.
When I chop stuff, I use it to scrape up all the goodies and put them in the container.
I also use it to clean off my prep area for food and flour.
When I make dough I can cut it in pieces with it and it had a nice ruler on the end.
Then I just put it into the dishwasher and it cleans up easily.
OXO is known for making high quality, useful products at affordable prices.
As far as this product goes, it meets all three of those expectations!!!  I bought mine to use on my cutting block.
Sure, this may be for pastry use, but I find it to be quite good for everyday use.
The edge is slightly sharpened at the bottom which makes chopping through smaller items a breeze.
Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.
This bench scraper is extremely efficient and practical.
I use it to cut scones, biscuits, and split loaves of bread all the time.
It also works as a safe way of cutting open squashes and melons, and cleans sticky dough off countertops very easily.
Was surprised to see that the cutting edge has an etched measuring line.
Takes the place of a ruler when measuring dough cuts.
I just got this a week ago and can't understand why at 50 years of age I am just learning of this tool.
I have used it to chop and dice and being able to pick up veggies etc with it is the best part.
I love making home made bread and pizza and this pastry scraper is wonderful; I couldn't ask for more.
Buy an extra at this price-makes a great scrapper for hard cleanups and makes a great little gift.
Easy to clean.I would buy it again.I use this for baking bread, even cutting soaps!.
It is both sturdy and tough! It works a million times better than my old one.
It is a bit expensive but I think it is worth the money.
This scrapes all my untidiness off the granite and into the oubliette.It gets up under dough while kneading, freeing from any sticking.
Sometimes I think two would be even better.
Sharp, easy to use...large vegees...all vegees...keeps them on the cutting board...easy to clean and scrap the vegees were you want them.
Needed a good pastry scraper and chopper for when I make home made hamburger rolls, and this fit the bill.
I scoop my fruit or veggies off my cutting board after cutting up.
Great to pick up pastries, biscuits, cutting dough for your bread loaves.
This one is really sturdy and has a good, soft, easy to hold grip.
I haven't used it for baking ( scraping) yet, but I used it for chopping.
I prefer my chef's knife for more precise chopping/dicing but this tool is handy for quick chopping of celery, onions, nuts, etcetera.
I imagine the edge could be sharpened to make it more effective as a chopper.
The size of the blade makes it nice for swooping up the chopped material for transfer to the pan.
I purchased this originally to help scoop and transfer all my chopped items from the counter to the pan.
But, it was perfect for making all of my pie dough.
Perfect for cutting vegetables and it is made of solid stainless steal.
It is solid assembled and has no lose parts.
I purchased this scraper for lifting dough off of a pastry sheet, but also use it for lifting chopped vegetables off of the cutting board.
Before I bought the scraper; I was using a plastic one which would flex making it difficult to get the job done.
This OXO product like most of their designs is great.
We've used other brands and styles of scrapers, over the years.
This has turned out to be the most sturdy and easy to clean.
We've found that the ones with wood handles tended to absorb stains and flavors, over the years.
This is really a &#34;go-to&#34; product for me, very sturdy easy to hold, clean.
I don't know why I didn't get the OXO Pastry Scraper sooner.
I find I'm using it constantly to pick up large amounts of cut vegetables for transfer to another bowl or pan.
Much easier than lifting the heavy cutting board or trying to pick them up with my hands.
It's also great for cutting dough in half.
I'm sure I'll find more handy uses as time goes by.
I've also come to use it to clean up the dough and such from my work surface.
I'm impressed with the sturdiness of this product.
It feels like it can really take a beating in the kitchen.
It's another OXO well-designed product (most of them are) and it's nice that the measurements are etched on and not painted/stamped.
This kitchen tool I use almost every day.
Great for cutting, chopping and scraping, I wonder what I used to use before I got one of these.
Now I give them as gifts, to my kids as they have left the house, and for wedding gifts.
(Goes nicely with a brownie pan or cookie sheet.)  I use mine for making scones, cutting brownies, scraping dough, cutting butter, so many different uses.
It's very sturdy and will last my lifetime I'm sure!.
I've always need a scraper and saw this one while shopping here, and decide to get it.
Oxo makes good products, and I've never had a problem with their stuff.
On those occasions this wonderfully made OXO tool won't do.
Nice basic dough scraper, the handle is comfortable and the construction is sturdy.
I use it for dough and transferring chopped ingredients to the pan.
this is really sharp, so please keep away from children.
it's also a great scoop to move your chopped ingredients to another container.
This scraper comes in handy for so many things.
I mostly use it for putting chopped foods into whatever I am cooking, but I do use it for baking and sometimes measuring.
Not that it takes much time with a biscuit cutter, but it goes faster and I only roll out the dough once (better biscuits).
This also makes handling doughs easier than trying to use both hands.
I've also used it to slice cookie dough and it works great.I like the handle a lot.
It's easy to hold and use.This is not the most innovative item for the kitchen, but it is well worth having.
I'd bet anyone would be happy having this scraper in their kitchen!.
I use this a lot when making noodles, pasta and pot-pie(Bot Boi).
The recessed increments up to 6&#34; are really helpful and dishwasher safe.( It still gets washed by hand.) The handle is &#34;cushy&#34;, not hard plastic.
Also works as a scoop and edge is beveled for chopping, but not very sharp.
You might want to sharpen it if you really want to chop hard vegetables with less effort.
Not much to say here; it is exactly as described.
I remembered the cooks having these in my Navy days and thought about getting one but I rarely baked so it wasn't necessary.
We bake more now and this is a great have when baking large batches of any kind of dough.
Easy to cut and scrape with an easy grip handle and large work surface.
The best thing about this tool is the ruler embossed on one side.
I used it for a long time before I noticed it.
May have to raise it to 5 star quality.
I first saw it being used on Cook's Country and America's Test Kitchen television programs.
I thought it made sense and purchased it.
I have now found that it is so much more than just a bench scraper.
This is particularly good for transferring chopped items to a waiting pan.
In the past, I've used a knife blade but I worried about cutting myself.
I needed a new scraper and this one fits the bill to a T.
I usually find their recommendations useful and this one is great.
This works so well for making pita bread and cutting your big loaf into smaller loaves and ultimately the individual pizzas.
Also good for rounding up scraps on your butcher block.
Very glad I got this, makes me feel like a pro!.
&#34;Pish posh, another gadget,&#34; I sniffed when I saw this scraper/chopper.
For years I struggled with metal spatulas and butter knives cutting all sorts of foods thinking that was just the way things had to be.
I purchased this scraper/chopper on a whim and when it arrived I immediately noticed that it's a really nice size.
The molded handle fits comfortably in the hand and gives me the leverage I need to cut things in pans.
Best of all, it works like a charm.
This is a very handy tool and I would recommend it to anyone who cooks.
I use this to scoop up cut veggies, etc from the cutting board.
Very effective at getting dough off the cutting board.
A pastry scraper seems like a kitchen gadget you could do without but I'm finding this to be very handy.
So far I haven't used it for pastry (I plan to, though) and I haven't used it as a chopper.
What it has been useful for is scooping up vegetables I've chopped on the cutting board.
It has a comfortable, solid feel to it.
And for whatever reason it slices, scrapes etc, way better than the plastic scrapper.
Might be that the thing is big enough to get a decent hold on it, and the grip is comfortable.
I purchased this for working with bread dough, for cutting and dividing dough for pastries.
A neat little gadget to have in the kitchen.
It's helpful when making biscuits or measuring dough...easy to clean...good purchase.
Scrapped counter clean from sticky fondant, picked up everything for easy disposal, the best multi tasker ever!.
I think this is for baking bread, but I use it to pick up chopped veggies and what not from the cutting board.
Excellent grip , sharp enough for cutting semi soft vegetables such as cabbage but excellent tool for scraping up food.
After I sharpened this a bit I used it to cut cheese and other veggies.
We have already utilized it multiple times (bread and pizza doughs) and it works well for our home baking needs.
The plastic handle is comfortable to grip and to apply pressure.
This cutter is very handy when you are chopping up onions, celery, etc.
You chop up something and then use the blade to scoop up the pieces and add them to a pot or pan.
This is a perfect, indispensable tool in the kitchen.
You'll never pick up chopped veggies with your hands again.
Sweep this under whatever is on your cutting board and you're in business.
The OXO Good Grips line has done it again with their Pastry Scrapper/Chopper.
It works excellently for pastry scrapping and chopping, but it does so much more than that.
For anything that needs a rough cut (i.e.
tomatoes for sauce), this is now my go-to device.
Pick one of these up for your kitchen, you won't regret it!.
I've been pleased with all the OXO products I've purchased.
Works as it should to cut dough, though I wish it was a little sharper.
I purchased as a gift for my daughter because she didn't have one.
She is very happy with it and she uses it all the time now that she is the happy owner.
The pastry scraper works for pastry as well as working for breads also, multifunction.
It does what it says and does it well and it didn't cut me like some have.
Very easy to use, easy to clean up, appears to be built to last.
This scraper is easy to hold onto and sturdy.
It's a really handy addition to my kitchen.
I've used it to chop chocolate and clear off my counter between batches of cookies.
I also like the measurment lines on the end.
I bought this scraper to cut and portion bread dough.
The measurements etched along the blade are also useful for portioning dough.The scraper also cleans up easily.
It is dishwasher safe, and the dough doesn't seem to stick to the scraper.
one of my favorite purchases, i mainly use this for separating dough.
it's a good quality yet inexpensive little tool.
ive used it far more than i thought i would.
High quality item that does just what it says it will.
It is very rigid, but if that's what you're looking for in a scraper, this one is a great deal and very well built!.
Oxo is fond of rubberized grips, which do make for comfortable usage.
Your mileage may vary depending on your drawer space and orientation.
I HAD NO IDEA HOW OFTEN I WOULD USE THIS.
I BELIEVED IT WOULD BE SOMETHING FOR PEOPLE MORE PROFESSIONAL THAN MYSELF.
I ORDERED BECAUSE A COOKIE RECIPE I HAD SUGGESTED IT.
I AM GLAD THAT I DID BECAUSE IT HAS COME IN SO HANDY FOR SO MANY THINGS.
My husband and I love this wonderful tool and use it frequently.
This is one product we have gotten our money's worth out of.
Use it to handle those soft sticky doughs and for clean up anytime.
I used it just the other day handling sticky dough for homemade crescent rolls.
I have a light weight pastry scraper that has gotten slightly warped over the  years.
This one is VERY well made and shouldn't ever warp.
It does the job for me, mainly as a pastry board scraper, but it's sharp enough to be a cutter as well.
This scraper/chopper is awesome! It has a sharp enough edge to chop herbs or cut pastry.
It even has a ruler on the edge so you can measure the length or thickness of your product.
It has a nice grip and feels good in the hand.
It came to me quickly and I love it! This is a kitchen must have!.
Our thirteen year old son have seen this scrapes/choppers on many cooking shows he watches.
There's not much you can say about this product.
It's does what it needs to do and it's a must-have for any baker.
In the past I would tear apart dough with my hands or use a knife, making a mess.
I have two of these because they are super for cut up meat.
I don't like to use the same one for meat and dough.
The other one is from another site and I paid almost double what this one cost and it isn't as nice as this one.
This one has a nice rubber handle which makes it solid to hold.
When I cut up meat for stir frying these are perfect for picking the meat up and carrying it to the pan.
I use them both a lot.I can't imagine not having one for so long and I've been cooking for over 50 years.
This is what a dough scraper should be, metal, stainless steel, with a comfortable plastic handle.
Made to fit your hand comfortably and can be used to scrape dough from, well, pretty much anything.Buy one you'll like it.
I use it to scoop up diced foods and removing excess dough after cutting cookies out with cookie cutters.
Another ergonomic tool from OXO--a little heavy compared to others though.
Performs as you would expect in the kitchen.
I bought another one for the wood shop to scrape excess glue from joined boards.
The bits and pieces that can damage jointer/planers.
It does the job and comes out with no damage.
I use it for shoveling off the cutting board into the pan mostly, but it's super nice for baking pastries.
The sharpened edge is handy for easy chopping if you notice something that slipped through the process.
I'd only hand wash this though, keep it out of the dishwasher (as with all other knives and anything you want to last for awhile).
I've had mine for awhile and it looks brand new.
It's one of those things that you can't imagine yourself using, but once you have it you realize how much time it saves.
This scraper is awesome! It has a sharp edge that really gets under the food.
The ruler on the side is handy too.
This is great for cutting up bread dough.
Didn't need to scrape or measure but I don't see why it  wouldn't work.
Nice weight to it and it feels quite sturdy.
Very comfortable to hold...I have arthritis, and it does a great job of helping with daily cutting and scraping chores.
After chopping mirepoix with my chef's knife, it "evens" out the veggie dice sizes quite nicely and scoops everything into the pot beautifully.
I have intended to purchase one of these for a long time and just kept putting it off.
I made the purchase, received the OXO PASTRY SCRAPER AND HAVE BEEN USING IT OFTEN.
Regret I didn't purchase it at an earlier time.
Great for dividing your dough, gives you a measurement on the blade, is comfortable to use and work with.
Doing any dough or pastry work, buy it; works much better than the old butcher knife!.
This has a nice grip, is very solid and actually has a ruler etched into the edge.
OXO makes the best gadgets ever!!! This scraper is easy to handle and gets the job done.
No sharp edges and very high quality as all their items are.
I love that it has a ruler - I never thought I'd use that but I do all the time.
I use it for scraping when I'm cleaning my kitchen, like anything dried on the counter or burned spills on my glass stove top.
It's also good for when I'm making dinner to use to scoop up chopped things onto it to put into a bowl or pan.
Usually it rinses right off, or I put it in the dishwasher and it cleans up great.
It was a really good buy in my opinion.
I love how they have good grips on the majority of their items and this scraper/chopper is no exception.
I use it mostly to scrape off the counter and the cutting board and less often to chop with so it serves its purpose.
I bought this pastry scraper/chopper because it had been recommended by America's Test Kitchen.
Previously, I used a knife to slice the dough.
This works much better, because it's taller than the knife and the angle is pushing down on the dough instead of slicing.
That is no longer an issue.I'm very pleased with the quality, feel, and performance of this pastry scraper.
This pastry scraper is great for easily dividing dough into smaller pieces.
The ruler on the bottom is very useful when you are rolling your dough out to a specific size.
I just knew I would like this and I love it.
Bought this for my husband who loves to cook!He uses it to get dough unstuck from the board and to move food.Very handy tool!.
I have had this scraper for over ten years and I couldn't bake without it.
Great for cutting dough and the ruler on the blade is a real convienence.
I love that I can easily scrape dough and flour off my counter with ease.
Easy to clean, easy to store...you'll wonder how you ever got along without it.
I bought this after a trip to Italy where we used it in a cooking class to make gnocchi.
I've used it several times since then in chopping ground beef during cooking and to scrape dough off a cutting board.
This is a good product for cleaning counters after using flour which always manages to get away from the dough board.
The handle is comfortable and the edge sharp for cutting.
Proud to have this addition in my kitchen.
This is made with great materials and it withstands lots of use.
The handle is pretty bulky so it's easy to hang on to.
I like the measurements marked on the side as well as the slightly sharp edge.
This is another necessary kitchen item that I don't know why I went so long without having one.
It is also made of good quality materials and even has a ruler etched into the cutting edge.
I bought this along with the Snow River Pastry Board reviewed elsewhere to use in making bread, a hobby I just took up.
It is very helpful in the early stages of kneading (I prefer kneading by hand) when the dough is frequently sticky and difficult to handle.
This is a great paster scraper, the measurements on it are handy and the plastic handle very pleasing to grip.
It cuts easily through dough, even some of my thick cookie doughs.
Don't think that it's only for pastry though! I use it all the time when cutting up veggies, etc.
rather than using my knife to scoop things off the cutting board.
Much safer and gives you more surface area to carry items with as well.
Haven't used it yet, however, I like the weight of it and the grip on top is nicely shaped and easy to hold.
I got tired of using various spatulas and knives for scraping the work surface when making doughs and other messy things.
The Oxo has a good, simple design and it just works.
The handle is easy to grip and there's even a measuring scale along the edge for quick size references.
This tool is simple and effective and the price isn't bad either.
I'm not sure if I find this to be an advantage or a disadvantage.
It makes it a more multi-functional product for sure; however, I think it might slightly compromise the dough-scrapping-from-counter flagship role.
Always saw cooks using a bench scraper on tv and thought I'd order this and try.
Love it for having measurement ticks on it as well as scraping up odds and ends after rolling dough.
Also helps with picking up dough from countertop.
Scoop up all the chopped onions that you've made for your spaghetti sauce.
I got this to help me with pastries.
I just haven't used it as much as I thought I would.
Either I am not being inventive, or I have other tools that better solve problems that this one would.
I like the measurement markings.I will be using it next to make a gingerbread house for Christmas.
For the money I don't see how it could do a better job.
The edge makes it easy to cut and the measurements on the scraper are helpful.
The grip is rubberized and fits my smaller hands well.
The blade is substantial, not flimsy, but it still works well for cleaning up dough.
I don't expect that I will have to replace this any time soon.
Great for dough cutting, cutting portions in general, and you can use it to scrape your food off the counter.
It's especially helpful when I have dough stuck to my counter tops.
Love how it's easy to cut portion sizes...brownies, cakes, dough, pizza, whatever.
I cook/bake A LOT, so i love this tool.
I bought this just to have it and it's been very useful when I made bread or rolls.
This gets so much use that I don't know how I managed before without this handy tool.
I mainly use it for transferring chopped veggies from the cutting board to a bowl or pan.
What I didn't expect was how often I would use it for chopping.
It's a sturdy weight, doesn't bend, and has a nice sharp edge.
I love using it for cutting even, straight, brownies and bars--works much better than a knife.
I was hoping for a larger bench scraper, but I can't seem to find one that easily.
That being said, I really like this scraper.
I like the nonslip handle, so if my hands are wet, I don't lose my grip on the scraper.
It seems sturdy enough for tough jobs, and there are measurements along the edge.
I've been using it more than I thought I would.
I use this is a lot of my baking and have had good results with it.
I bought this on a whim, and now find that I can't do without it when making bread and pastry.
As an engineer, I'm very careful (my kids say loony) about wanting everything a uniform size.
OXO makes good quality items, and this one is quite useful.
I thought about skipping the extra cost and substituting it with a similar product I already had but I'm glad I didn't.
The handle has some weight to it which makes it perfect for cutting dough.
I didn't notice the measurements on the "blade" when I placed my order but they have came in handy numerous times.
This is perfect for the casual or more experienced baker!.
I use this more for scooping than scraping pastry dough.
It is a handy addition to my gadget stash.
I haven't tried chopping with it yet but I think it would work well for onions, garlic & fresh herbs.
Something you never think you need until you get one.
Very high quality steel, nice and thick, not flimsy at all.
This is one tool she uses to make all her traditional foods that involve dough.
She said the weight of this is just right since she has used this kind of scraper in other people's homes.
She would always said oh it's not like the one I have.
It gives her a good grip with staining her hand.
She's been using this for years and still continues using this.
Would buy her a new one if this one ever decides to break.
After years of not cooking anything that didn't go into the microwave, I finally decided that I needed to cook again.
This chopper/scraper has so many uses around the kitchen.
Good tool to add to your kitchen utensils.
I use it mostly for scooping up things I have diced and chopped.
I have also used it a few times for cutting dough.
The measures on it made it easy to cut things up into equal parts.
My dad always says you need the right tools to get the job done.
How true!  This has been my go to for cutting cinnamon rolls, baked brownies, dough.
Although this is described as a pastry scraper, we have found it has many uses.
Oxo is known for ergonomically designed tools, combining form & function.
This was a great buy!  It is very solid and makes cutting through dough/pastry so easy.
Update 8/25/07:  I love this so much that I bought a second one!  Now I have one for baking and another for everything else.
When I cook big meals, I tire of having to rewash it.This is my second bench scraper.
The first was a single sheet of metal that curved to form a handle.
This product is a lot heavier than my previous version and I like the weighty feel.Dishwasher safe.
I wish the measurements were printed on both sides instead of only one side.
Other than that, this is my favorite tool in the drawer.
I use it to help cut pizza dough and biscuits, it really works well.
It cuts well (I've used it for cutting dough into portions in the past).
It feels good in the hand and is solidly made.
This is a well made, heavy duty scraper.
The edge is straight, the handle is comfortable.
The size is just right, not too large to be bulky or too small to be efficient.
I HAD ORDERED THIS AND LOVE IT, HOWEVER, WHEN MY DAUGHTER CAME TO VISIT FROM TEXAS , SHE ASKED WHERE I GOT IT.
I GAVE IT TO HER AND ORDERED ANOTHER FOR MYSELF AND ONE FOR A FRIEND.
I now make naan, flour tortillas, and gyro bread.
I LOVE being able to so easily cut the dough into portions (12, 16, 12).
The key to fluffy flour tortillas is to work the dough as little as possible.
At least it is on the recipe I use (flour, olive oil, milk, salt, and baking powder).
So, this awesome cutter does double duty for me!!.
I purchased this OXO Pastry tool because I've taken on the task of baking more and more of my families bread.
And none of my regular knives were working out at all.This OXO chopper works great.
It's very sharp and cuts through the dough cleanly.I would give it Five-Stars except for one thing and that is the black handle.
Excellent price (currently under 10) and works well.
I use it all the time to clean my counters.
I just scrape everything into a trashcan and it makes wiping the counters down a breeze.
Flour tends to get everywhere and sticky when baking so I would not ever do it without this! Definitely recommend!.
I have a thick wooden cutting board so delivering the veges to the stove and pushing them into the skillet doesn't work.
This item is well made; nice non-slip ergonomic handle.
I am torn sometimes, because OXO stuff is well designed for the most part, but it is all made in China.
This scraper is sturdy and sharp and I expect years of use, though.
As far as construction quality, it's very well made, very heavy duty and likely will last for years and years.
The handle has a nice gripping area and it doesn't slip out of your hands when wet.We'd buy again, but I doubt we'll need to.
I bought this scraper along with aJohn Boos 20-by-15-Inch Reversible Maple Cutting Board, and couldn't be happier with it as a tool.
In my opinion, it's a must-have for anyone with a large wood board that's not easy to move, or someone with a butcher block countertop.
It's easy to clean, unlike other bench scrapers with a rolled handle which can trap food particles inside.
It is also very handy for cutting pizza dough, dividing scones, smashing garlic, and measuring thickness of meat to determine cooking time.
The measurements are engraved into the metal and won't wear off.
Love this Pastry Scraper!  I can't believe I have never owned one.
I have found it is a must have.
I have large hands and this scraper fits in my hand perfectly without feeling like I have to hold on to it too tight.
The handle feels wonderful and seems to be kind of &#34;non-slip&#34;.
I have also used this to coarsely chop some almonds and it worked great.
If I had to choose one of the best things I have in my utensil drawer, this would definitely make the top ten.
I've been experimenting with different pizza dough recipes and this scraper is invaluable for handling all kinds of dough, even the sorta wet "slack" doughs.
I got some cheese stuck on my baking stone after making pizza and used the scraper to clean it off.
It worked great but the baking stone acted like a sharpening stone and I cut my thumb deeply on the freshly honed edge.
I then dulled the edge on the same stone but yikes! Who wudda thunk?.
I do a lot of vegetable chopping, and this scraper really speeds things up.
Much faster and easier than using the knife or your hands to transfer chopped food.
Easy Grip for stability, allowed cutting harder vegetables more easily and alsokept up the speed of chopping, I recommend this item for your everyday chopping.
This pastry scraper - like most everything Oxo makes is comfortable to use, well made and not bad to look at.
It fits comfortably in your hand, has measurements on the blade which come in handy, and is very sturdy.
I have always just cut my pastry and bread dough with a knife.
I saw this and I thought I'd give it a try.
I love it! I feel like a professional baker! I cut through my pastry dough with ease.
When the pastry starts to stick I just scrape it up and dust a little flour under it.
When I'm all done, I use the scraper to make clean-up a breeze.
This makes all my baking projects so much faster and more professional.
Small enough and good-looking enough too, and good value for the price.
Have been using for many months now, and no problem faced.
Cant speak to use as pastry cutting tool I haven't tried it as such yet.
It's smaller than what the photo looks but the measurements are correct in the listing.
Works very well, blade is sharp and cuts dough easily.
Also use it to scrape up any dough stuck to my counter.
Recommend this item for anyone who bakes routinely.
A family member gave me this for Christmas.
I like the handle and the ruler on the edge.
The sharp edge can chop but that is a trade off for a lack of flexibility many scrapers have.
Although it's not as sharp as I thought it would be, it does help someone with lower arm/hand strength to work in the kitchen.
For something soft, it would be effective, but is not sharp enough to chop anything dense or tough/hard.
I have found this even more useful than I expected.
There are similar items available but the ruler measurements along the edge gave this item, well....an edge!.
I knew I'd need this someday, but didn't realize how often I'd reach for it.
I recently made petit fours and could not have asked for a better kitchen tool to help me along the way.
The ruler is so handy when aiming for uniformity in pastries.
It is a tall tool, so I was able to cut through multiple layers easily.
It cuts cleanly and is sharp enough to do so without being so sharp that you have to watch your fingers.
The blade is thin enough that I will use this when trying to get too-tacky pie dough off a surface.
I would not use this for cutting hard vegetables.
It is not meant to be used as a knife.
The metal is thin enough to be useful on delicate cooking projects, while maintaining a straight edge and never bending.
I highly recommend getting one of these to add to your kitchen tool arsenal.
This will be my second of these scrapers.
The first one disappeared at the same time that my daughter moved out.
I got mine on time and as advertised.
very useful tool: i use it when i make pie doughs.
Anyone who is serious about pastry should get this!.
This replaced my old that I used so much I wore it out LOL.
This is a staple when I'm cooking, cutting, doing anything in the kitchen.
This tool is great for breads and cookies.
I like the measurement guide on one side of the blade.
Works well for my use for over a year.
How did I live without this?  I use this almost daily and love it.
I've had this scraper for about two years now, and it still looks like new.
Deeply engraved measurements along the edge, and a nice thick handle on the top of grippy oxo rubber.
Very useful for scooting large quantities of chopped nuts, flour, and other ingredients.
WOW This little beauty is a dream! I cannot believe I didn't own one.
It chops/minces little batches of herbs too but I have plenty of things that but nothing like this to scrape, lift and measure.
Trust me even if you think you don't need it...you'll love it.
I have never found an OXO item that I did not love, and this bench scrape is no exception.
It is made from a fine grade of stainless steel with a perfect edge.
It is sealed very well to the stainless steel so there is no worry of water getting in between.
I like having this rubbery handle, as opposed to the ones I've seen with the rolled stainless steel handle, because it is easier to grip.
My son decided he wanted to make a double batch of decorated sugar cookies for the holidays.
We used the recipe in Joy of Cooking which is tasty but stuck terribly to our board.
This was highly recommended by the folks at America's Test Kitchen.
They were so right...it works like a real charm!.
Followed a trustworthy review from cooks illustrated and they hit the nail on the head.
Super robust, not cheap feeling and it looks like it will last me for quite a while!.
Was pleased at the quality of this item when received.
It is heavy duty, the handle provides for a solid grip with a supple, silicone type feel.
I make a lot of artisan bread, this is very useful for scraping the counter free of excess dough.
It has a measure which helps in keeping bread sizes in check, I also use it for cutting.
I use it for pasta, bread, pie and cooky dough.
Blade is not knife sharp but it cuts clean.
I love this product, it was a birthday gift and I have used it repeatedly since I received it.
This is an excellent scraper at a great price.
I really enjoy having this scraper in my kitchen.
It makes cutting dough and cleaning up very easy.
Definitely a huge help in cooking, especially for baking pies.
I purchased it a couple of weeks ago and I am using it all the time.
It is durable and you can even measure with it.
Yes, it's good at what it does: scraping.
This thing does a great job of cleaning up the countertop after kneading bread and getting flour all over the place.
I think I will have to get some as gifts for people for Christmas.
My mom visited and she fell in love with it.
It scrapes great, it cuts cinnamon rolls and dough perfectly.
I have to admit - I actually just use this scraper as a scraper -- cleaning up the counter tops after cooking/baking/rolling, etc.
Perfect size, dishwasher safe, and does the job!  Great add-on to all of my other OXO tools!.
Works great to cut my pie and cookie dough in half and to scrape it up off of the counter after it is rolled.
I like to make fudge for the holidays and I was having trouble cutting it out once it had hardened in the refrigerator.
My sister suggested one of these for cutting brownies, so I immediately thought of my fudge, also.
Well, a few days later I ordered this product and I am absolutely satisfied with it.
It really helped cut the fudge into manageable pieces.
It helped to make them look professional enough to take to holiday parties.
And, according to my sister it will work great for brownies.
I have also used this to cut frozen pound cake and again, I am fully satisfied with the results.
I also find it very handy to use as a scraper for the countertops and cutting boards.
I can hardly wait to use it when I divide my homemade pizza dough.
I don't know how I got by without it for so many years.
Great for a multitude of uses...I particularly love the measurement increments etched into the metal....they won't wash off!  I love it!.
I love the weight of the handle, feels very substantial in hand, hopefully it'll last.
This is pretty straight forward, but I wonder how I ever managed before.
This is great working with my dough and great cleaning my toaster oven (scraping the crumb tray which often has carbonized spillage crusted on it).
Be warned -- the edge is SHARP! I continue to place it back in the cardboard holder it arrived in.
I'd like to see a storage case created for this.
I like this scraper for picking up chopped/diced items to add to a dish or pot.
Using it is so much easier and quicker than using a knife or my fingers.
It is really nice to have good kitchen tools to use and not improvise with whatever knife one has.
Why wouldn't you buy a tool that is this handy, is this well-built, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.
It wants to help you divide dough into halves, quarters, and thirds with ease.
In fact, this may be one of the most useful tools in your kitchen.
If you got it somewhere else, you probably paid too much.
Besides that, the handle is comfortable and cute.
Takes a bit to learn how to use this but for baking it cannot be beat.
Use to scrape together your dough then to loosen the crust from the kneading surface.
Item is marked with inch designations on the bottom but have not had any need for them.
A little difficult to store in my 'junk&#34; drawer - tends to lock the drawer shut from the inside!  Oops!  Time for a new home.
I love my new OXO Good Grips Multi-Purpose Pastry Scraper/Chopper!  I have arthritis in my hands and find this gadget easy and comfortable to grasp.
It has been great for chopping veggies and I have found it wonderful to use to slice hard cheeses.
I haven't used it to lift pastry yet, but I'm sure that it will be equally useful for that purpose as well.
It is well made and I expect it to last a long time.
well made, strong blade can hold the weight of the food, but flexible enough to be useful.the ruler on the edge comes in handy.
I had been looking for a decent pastry cutter for a little bit, they are many options out there.
This seemed to fit right into the pocket of quality constructions and value.
I am happy to say that I use this item regularly, from cutting dough, to cleaning flat surfaces to even scrapping pans.
I like having this tool at my disposal.
I had always had one (different brand) and needed to replace it when the old handle cracked.
I cook a lot and use my kitchen tools all the time.
This pastry scraper, much to my surprise, is my &#34;go to&#34; tool!  I originally bought it to use for my bread making process.
This item arrived on time and is an excellent purchase.
I like it very much and am VERY glad I ordered it.
Thank you so much Amazon.com for the great price,  good value and prompt delivery.
I use this every time I chop vegetables for cooking.
It makes it quick and easy to load chopped vegies into the pot after chopping them up.
This oxo grips multi-purpose pastry scraper and chopper is all-in-one tool.
Cut you butter into the flour, scrap the flour on the counter and chop it all together and easy to clean, thank you.
This is a great tool in the kitchen.
I now have two of them (two different kitchens) and love it.
This is great but came with an edge sharper than my cleaver.
Would have torn up my butcher block work surface.
I removed a lot of the edge with my honing steel.
You might want to do that also before you scratch up or shave your work surface.
Has a ruler on the edge going to 6 inches I believe which is helpful.
I use it to cut dough, to scrape flour back into a pile easily.
I don't do any baking & I don't do much cooking either.
I wanted a product like this for scraping up chopped vegetables (especially sliced onions) off a cutting board when making salads.
It's easier & safer than using the chef's knife.
It works very well & the grip is designed just right.
Although I had a hunch, I really never knew how much something so simple and mundane could drastically improve my cooking experience.
It's also great for cutting dough and any cutting tasks that require blunt vertical force.
Running my fingers along the blade does *not* result in a cut, if that gives you an idea.
Although some reviewers think of this as a downside, I don't think you want your scraper to be too sharp.
This isn't a knife replacement, so it shouldn't be sharp.This single tool makes both prep and clean-up substantially easier.
I recommend that everyone have at least one.
It's much sturdier than I imagined and comes in handy for so many things.
I've had cheap dough blenders before, and the blades always ended out pushed out of line from the butter or from the dough itself.
and they were impossible to clean! But the OXO Good Grips is fabulous.
And the famous OXO grip makes it easy to hold and doesn't hurt your hand.
Much better than cheapo dough cutters, and you'll never use the two-knife system again.
I bake many types of scones and pastries that demand perfect blending.
That means the fat and flour must be blended well, but not overblended.
This tool has taken a lot of the hard work and time out of the old way of using two knives in scissors action.
The overall balance to weight ratio is excellent; the handle is a good diameter and width, and the tines are spaced apart nicely.
The design of the tines makes reaching all parts of the bowl to pick up flour a breeze.
Cleanup is easy since you can toss it into the diswasher without fear of rust.
I highly recommend this product from novice to pro.
It's very hard to find a nice dough blender and this one is really nice.
The grip is wonderful and it cuts down that pie crust making time in half.
This is a real Godsend during the holidays when you're making all those cookies and cutting in the butter, as well as all your pies.
It washes up beautifully in the dishwasher and is basically something EVERYONE needs to have in their kitchen.
Even my 7 year old could cut in the butter like a pro!  Easy to clean.
The wires did separate a bit, but it doesn't affect its ability to cut through the butter/dough with ease.
One is OXO's spiffy traditional "Good Grips" handle, a soft, thick rubber handle that's easy on arthritic (or otherwise painful) hands.
First, the wire blades are flexible enough that sometimes large chunks of butter push them aside instead of getting sliced up by them.
A number of OXO items have broken under our care.
And while we unabashedly admit that we make heavy use of our kitchen items, we do not abuse them.
We're careful to take care of them, and have few cases of things gratuitously getting damaged.
There's not that much to say, is there?  This dough blender works perfectly.
It's much faster and more comfortable than the old &quot;two knives&quot; method.
And it's sure easier to clean than a food processor.
For making biscuits, pie or tart crust, or any other kind of baked pastry product, it's a great tool to have.
you should'nt really have a problem with the wire flexibility.
I like this one!  It's comfortable, reliable, economical and cleans up easily.
Find a better one that meets all those criteria (if you can).
For me, a person who doesn't need something like this all that much, this was just perfect.
It has a low price and is very comfortable to use.
It works effectively and I have had it for about 2 years.
In a home setting with an occasional user like myself this has been wonderful.
It has cleaned up very well which was  a wonderful surprise.
For the price this is a great one to own.
No mess; it's easy to manage any size sifting job: just control the side-to-side motion and there is no trouble using virtually any mixing bowl.
You can really shake it like crazy, or use the opposite hand to support and softly &quot;roll&quot; it.
The bottom cap keeps contents from falling through the mesh screen while you measure flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, etc into the top.
That way, you can move it around your workspace if you need to.
This is the best sifter I have ever owned, I am extremely happy with it.
I like this sifter especially for making cakes that require folding in sifted ingredients in portions at a time.
The bottom lid allows you to control the portion.
The top lid stops ingredients from flying out.
Sifting mechanism is smooth and easy and doesn't require any &#34;mad&#34; shaking around!.
So far have not found any issues with any OXO product.
This is the smallest sifter I've ever seen.
It will hold about two cups of flour.
I have a small kitchen and I don't sift a lot.
This item is easy to store.* The top and bottom lids.
The side-by-side sifting action works fine for my needs.
I can sift a cup of flour in about 20 - 30 seconds.
Would I want to do 10 cups per day like this?  Of course not.
For bigger jobs I'd get a bigger crank-style sifter.
I like the fact that this is not a bulky sifter and that it has lids on the top as well as the bottom.
Hope that the shaking part of it will not break, stay tuned.
I bake a lot but I don't hold to my mother's obsession with sifting everything before it goes into the bowl.
I like the back and forth mechanism on this.
I have carpal tunnel and the trigger model would kill me.
However, you really should be sifting your ingredients in a cup or so at a time anyway so you just have to sift in batches.
Works well for a sifter of flour and such.
Very durable and sturdy; much better than those that are much less expensive AND cheaply made.
I don't know why people are saying this product works slowly?  I find that you can dispense a cup of flour in about 10 seconds.
Oxo Good Grips Flour SifterThe OXO Good Grips Sifter was designed to make sifting easier and faster, and baking that much more enjoyable.
With a slight shake side to side, the sifting mechanism is activated and with little effort you have perfectly sifted flour.
These were the main features that I was looking for in a flour sifter.
Something that doesn't take up much room, but is efficient in its use with little effort.
The top and bottom lids keep flour fresh and the inside of your cupboards clean.
The OXO Good Grips Sifter is so much easier to use that you will look forward to those recipes that call for sifted ingredients.
Why would you ever store a sifter with any flour in it anyway, you are just asking for problems.
The bottom cap keeps contents from falling through the mesh screen while you measure flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, etc.
That way, you can move it around your workspace if you need to.
The mess is almost eliminated and you'll enjoy a better baking experience.Think of this sifter as a baker's tool and less as a sifter.
This product is great at working with dusting's.
The second good use is for putting flour down on the counter top to kneed bread.
It sifts over a large area so it is quick at making a light dust over a large area.
But don't forget that this sifter has a capacity for larger amounts of flour as well.
I get better results when I take my time baking, after-all, I'm baking and I'm not running the 100 yard dash.
That's what I tell my grandkids when they are over and we make/bake something they enjoy to eat.
A lot of thought was obviously put into this product.
It is well designed and manufactured from high quality materials.
I expect it will last me many years.Unlike some other reviewers I had no problem with speed.
I sifted 3 cups of flour in under a minute.
I did notice that the mesh screen at the bottom of the sifter can be removed for cleaning.
I also noticed that it can become dislodged and not flush with the agitator at the bottom of the sifter.
This may be why some folks are experiencing slow sifting.
They may simply need to realign the mesh screen properly.The plastic lids that come with this sifter are a brilliant addition.
Then use both lids when storing the unit.The metal is a very sturdy but I was disappointed by the plastic handle.
I would have preferred the rubberized grip OXO uses for most of their other products.(-1 star).
I've tried to up the rating to five stars and can't figure out how to do that.
I originally gave this four stars because I feel the design could be greatly improved with very little change.
It was the best sifter I've ever used and I've been looking for something like it ever since I started baking on my own.
This sifter gave me a hint that it might work the same way that old sifter did, and it's close.The sifter is very well made.
It is about 4 1/2" in diameter across the top and 3 1/2" across the bottom.
It will hold about three cups of flour, although it's only marked to two cups.
The "cup" portion is definitely quality stainless steel.
The pivot point of the handle is hidden under the "comfort grip" portion, so I can't tell what the connection is like.
There are no holes or openings in the "cup" portion that will leak flour.
The caps are a nice addition, especially the bottom cap.
With that on, you don't need to be concerned about the sifter dusting everything in the cupboard with flour.Another reviewer said it is very slow.
I've just tried mine out, and found out a few things I'd like to share.
When I filled it, hardly any flour would sift.
I found shaking it from side to side was on the slow side, even with a smaller amount.
Using the memory of my mother's sifter, I tried holding the cup and moving the handle back and forth with my other hand.
This worked VERY well, and the sifting was as fast as any other sifter I've used.
When moving the handle back and forth it was going across the entire bottom and ending against the side.
The little "bump" against the side seemed to make the difference between fast and slow sifting.
This would be the perfect sifter if it was small enough for me to hold comfortably in one hand.
And that's saying a lot since I've been looking for a good sifter for 30 years!.
The shaking can be a bit cumbersome for those that have a problem with repeatative motion difficulty.
I usually keep a few rice grains in the bottom of any sifters for that extra help, but this thing barely needs it.
I've had a couple trigger sifters flat out break on me and by far prefer this design-nothing mechanical to break down.
This does the job - much neater than any other sifter.
I've owned battery operated ones, used a sifter while tapping it against my hand (messy!) and this new one is so much easier to use.
You can hold onto all the ingredients and then sift the ingredients in the bowl.
We do not use a sifter too often, but we did need a sifter for the times where it is really required.
Overall, this sifter is sturdy and carries the Oxo name with pride.
Also, it takes a good bit of time to sift a large quantity of flour.
It might help to have a larger container or a different type of mechanism.
But if you need something larger you are likely looking at a different sifter anyway.
While it could be improved upon, this sifter is by no means a bad product.
In fact, it is a very good product and meets/exceeds our needs.
The Oxo Good grips Flour Sifter is recommeded for most people.
I love the fact there are two covers both top and bottom.
The sifter is a shake sifter which is great for those of us with arthritis.
Over all, well made and a must for all bakers.
gr8 for getting lumps out of the flour and for loading dry ingredients and mixing them together as u sift.
Oxo wins again with this handy gadget! (Excuse the pun)  It is easy to use and can be operated one-handed using a side-to-side motion.
It has tight-sealing lids for both the top and bottom, so you can leave flour in it all of the time.
It holds two cups, which is perfect for most applications, yet it remains small enough for easy storage.
I have psoriatic arthritis, which effects my hand & wrist joints.
After  typical use with this sifter, my wrist joint is pretty sore.
I do not think this is a better option than traditional sifters, in that regard, but I thought I would mention it.
Perhaps the tag is there because the handle is more ergonomic.
I received this product as a gift and love it.
It's easy to use and the covers for the top and bottom make it great for when you need to add things gradually.
This is a wonderful gift for any cook.
My husband uses this every week when he makes crepes.
I wouldn't use a tiny bowl to sift into, but it doesn't have to be huge to keep from making a mess.
This works very well and my hand doesn't get cramped up when I'm sifting a bunch of flour for cookies or bread.
Lots of reviewers have commented about how it took them minutes to sift a single cup of flour.
I sifted 3 cups worth in about 15 seconds, and I wasn't shaking it excessively either.
This utensil will slide under cookies stuck on a baking pan without cracking or crumbling them.
It will allow you to remove a small square of brownie or cake from a pan without breaking up the pieces alongside it.
It transfers several appetizers or treats at a time.
And if you do use it to ice a cake, the offset handle provides excellent control and keeps your fingers out of the frosting.
It smoothes any topping to absolute perfection -- you will look like a pro.
I use this for icing cakes, transferring cookies to a cooling rack, serving cake, brownies, etc.
I love this tool and I plan on getting a couple more because it's used so often.
the oxo good grips bent icing knife is a good purchase.
i think i would have preferred the shorter knife, but it was not available a the time i bought this one.
the shorter one would be easier to manouver around on a cake.
As a gift, my granddaughter says that she really appreciated my gift.
I have one exactly like this one, and I'm so glad that my granddaughter loves it.
I have been meaning to buy an off-set spatula and finally did order this one.
It's great for spreading cream filling into a blind-baked pie crust.
Thank you OXO!!!  I haven't used this great tool for icing a cake yet.
Another great OXO product easy on the hands.
Seems very sturdy as does everything that OXO Grips puts its name under.
I bought this because I, too, wanted a longer icing knife.
I works well, with the exception that it is flexible.
So, the frosting cannot be cold or stiff, which sometimes makes the cake more difficult to ice.
It does work fantastically with softer frostings and whipped cream.
I back quite a bit, and this knife has significantly reduced the time that it takes to frost a cake, it's that good.
Between this and my Wilton Trim-and-Turn Ultra cake turntable, I can get a cake frosted in minutes.
It has also survived multiple trips through the dish washer and still looks new.
After mangling a number of cakes with a butter knife, I gave in and bought this for icing my cakes.
This knife made the job SO much easier.
You just load it up with icing and start spreading.
It's simple and easy and the right tool for the job.
This knife is very easy to hold and handle.
I will order more of this in the future.
Finally, while frosting some cupcakes, I wrote myself a note and ordered an off set spatula.
It is one of those things you do for your self to make life easier.
It is a very comfortable knife with a nonslip handle.
The bent blade is perfect for putting the frosting on and then shaping the frosting to fit the cake or cupcakes.
You can slide the knife right under cookies to lift the cookies off without crumbles.
Anything, really that you want to move from a pan to another surface.
Many people, like me, never think to purchase one, and then once you have it, you wonder how you did without it.
A gift someone usually does not buy for themselves.
Remember this, when you are thinking of stocking stuffers.Recommended.
As with all OXO products you know your buying quality.
The grip handle is great for greesey butter icing hands.
I love to bake cakes, so I'm not sure why I waited so long to buy one of these.
Works wonderfully, very easy to use and flexible.
spread batter, frosting and a lot of other things around on a sheet pan or frost a cake.
Nicely made s/s blade and silicon handle with a nice grip.
Has gone through the dishwasher many times w/o any mishaps or rust problems.
I use this offset (Oxo calls it "bent") icing knife (really a spatula) on a regular basis.
I also slide it under the cheesecake to separate it from the springform base, and then use it to start lifting it off the pan.
I've used it numerous times for whipped cream and even Wilton's canned frosting, thinned a bit.
I used it the first week I had it and loved it the first time I used it.
This tool is ideal for whisking a loose batter, eggs, whatever.
It has the feel of a professional's tool.
I love the feel of the handle - you will not drop this accidentally! Worth every dime!.
I love all the Oxo Good Grips kitchen utensils because they are so comfortable to use.
I use this little 9" whisk a lot for small jobs.
It is perfect for mixing up a little thickening for gravy, whisking a few eggs to use in recipes when baking, or for scrambling eggs.
One little bit of advice is to rinse the whisk immediately after using to make clean-up easier.
I made the mistake of letting food dry on it a couple of times, and it made cleaning it more difficult.
I highly recommend this whisk for all cooks.
The handle, the length and the diameter of this product has made long term whisking less arduous.
This size whisk is perfect for small jobs.
Feels great in the hand and is well made.
I have had a whisk from the Dollar Store, worked OK for a while, but then fell apart.
It's a whisk, it's little, it works better than most.
I will buy a larger version of the same brand.
I reach for my OXO Good Grips 11-inch whisk 90% of the time.
It does a great job, the handle is comfortable, it's not too heavy but can whisk just fine.
Unless you're whisking egg whites by hand, this is an AWESOME go-to whisk.
I had an issue with another product that was my fault, and they replaced it kindly.
I have many of their kitchen products and have liked them all.
The whisk is great but smaller than you would think.
If you are looking for a standard size whisk go with the 11.
It is well made  and is great for smaller tasks like whipping eggs for omelets.
And i have to say i love them both...The handle is what really helps.
This is my only whisk, and it is the perfect size to do just about any whisking job.
Sometimes it's a little small, but overall I would definitely suggest this to someone that doesn't want to buy 3 different sizes.
I own two of these just in case I ever need to scramble eggs and mix pancake batter at the same time.
It's small, but it's also sturdy and well balanced.
You're not going to mix a ten gallon vat of pancake batter with it.
But it's perfect for a family size mixing bowl or a three egg omelet.
I bought this whisk because my old one finally broke (2 of the wires popped out).
When I was browsing for a new one, I didn't really know how the whisk was measured.
This one is the "11-inch" model, but I didn't know from what to what was included in that measurement.
I also have a silicon-covered whisk, which is not so great, especially when stirring pudding that you have to stir forever.
I guess my old whisk was really junky, but this one is great.
Also the rubber handle is comfortable to hold.
I am a quadriplegic/tetraplegic (C5-6 if you care).
I have about 1/3 use of my hands and 1/2 use of my arms.
I can use most whisks with some effort, however, this Oxo one is almost effort-free for me.
I love this little whisk!  I always make my own salad dressing and this whisk is perfect for that.
The handle is comfortable to hold and weighted just enough that it doesn't tire my hand or wrist - even with severe arthritis.
It's large enough not to get totally lost in a bigger bowl but small enough to work efficiently in a tighter bowl too.
The tines aren't flimsy - they keep their shape while you are whipping away.
Can't think of a single thing I'd change.Last whisk standing.Highly recommended.
Unlike some of the previous, uneducated reviewers, I knew prior to ordering this item that it was not used for making Whiskey.
I knew that it was for beating things, such as eggs, whipped cream, and unruly children.
(The latter is an optional use - I would use the 11-inch whisk, also available from amazon, or a heavy iron spoon).
In short, this tool does its job with aplomb.
I enjoy whisking all manner of items, and find myself using this item when it really isn't necessary at all.
Just this morning I whisked myself a milk and organge juice smoothie, and followed that up by vigorously whisking my bowl of Rasin Bran.
Sure, flakes and milk ended up all over the place, but each cereal shard was coated with nice frothy milk.
Overall, this whisk is superb at doing what it was meant to do, and then some.
I think I may use it tonight to whisk together a bowl of chiken soup puree! YUM!.
This is almost a hybrid of the flat whisks and the balloon type.
I use this several times per week and love the small size.
Oxo is a staple in my kitchen--I love their stuff.
Do measure because it's small--a feature I really like.
As with mos of the good grips products, very comfortable handle.
Nice handle, good nine inch size, dishwasher safe and easy to store.
This whisk is the first one out of the drawer for the task.
I got two sizes and they are just the ticket for making sauces, pudding and such.
Your hands won't cramp while using them, nor will the whisks slip out of your hand.
I wanted one that wasn't 12" long and this fits the bill.
Nice and small and lots of wiring ~ sometimes I think too many, but it seems to work well for whisking dry ingredients while baking.
Easier to wash than any whisk I have ever owned - no weird crevasses to hold bacteria or dried food.
Handle is comfortable to hold even for long whisking tasks.
I like it so much I plan to purchase another soon!.
Some are overkill or just too overbuilt, but I think this is there sweetspot and they have consistent quality.
I bought the larger size first and loved it so I went ahead and bought this 9 inch and also love it.
A little larger would have been nice and there is no give to this whisk.
Good quality, OXO is a good brand that I frequently buy however be sure to pay attention to the dimensions.
I thought I was getting a bigger wisk length wise than I actually received.
It was my fault for not looking closer to the size.
I kept it anyway, I will use it.
It is just not the full length I wish I had purchased.
When I got this whisk I also got an 11 inch one because I have always used bigger ones.
I figured a small one would come in handy from time to time.Well, I was wrong.
THIS is the one I use all the time.
If you just want to get one whisk, I recommend this OXO and this size.
After one month of use, I hightly recommend it so far.
It's easy to handle, the size is perfect for small mixtures and it seems to have good quality, both the whisk and the grip.
The OXO 9-inch whisk is a very good product.
However, I should  have been more mindful when I ordered this because I already own this exact size.
I was looking for one that was slightly longer - about 11 inches, but still as slender to replace one that broke.
I use the whisk often, always with great results.
This is  a great whisk to add to your kitchen tools.
As always, the handle is quite ergonomic, an Oxo trademark.
I purchased this one because it is an in between size.
It's great for use with smaller bowls as the head of the whisk is narrower.
I actually use it more often than my large whisk.
It's smaller than the whisks I grew up with, so if you use big bowls, buy the next size up.
I own MANY oxo products and am pleased with almost all their products.
They all perform their function well and with style.
And they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle.
Seems very sturdily made and have had absolutley no problems.
OXO is the best in everything they make.
Exactly what I needed, I had one before but lost it in the move to a new house.
We have a couple whisks in our kitchen, but this is my go-to whisk for whipping up scrambled eggs, omelets, breakfast bakes, and the like.
It feels great in hand and zips through the eggs quickly, easily, and thoroughly.
When they say 9 inches they mean 9 inches from bottom of handle to tip.
The wires are not extremely rigid like the cheapies, but they don't feel like they are going to bend either.
They have just the right amount of give to make whisking together ingredients a snap.
Not only is this my favorite whisk, it is truly well made.
With a bit of pressure, you can whisk into every inch of a saucepan.
The OXO whisk is the best whisk I've ever had.
It's very sturdy and just the right size.
The handle makes it easy to hold on to.
I used to be a professional cook, and consequently I got spoiled when it comes to tools for my kitchen.
one I bought at the same time, are excellent-- and the price is phenominal for such a good product.
The grip is a big help if you have to whip up a pint of cream, as I did on Thanksgiving day!.
This whisk is so nice to use & doesn't rust in the dishwasher! I have both sizes now & won't ever buy another brand.
This 9" whisk is well made ..with a very nice handle.
For the bigger jobs....get their 11" whisk....which I will get soon.A whisk is a must....so many uses.
I even use them in some non-stick pans...carefully.Ideal for mushroom.
I actually ordered this whisk because the first one I bought is always in the dishwasher.
This is the whisk I grab for everything, gravy, batter, marinades, eggs, etc.
I have a larger whisk that also works well but just doesn't fit the hand as well.
With the shape of the handle and rubber texture this whisk has the perfect feel for every meal use.
I will probably end up buying a third as these two I now own will always be in the dishwasher.
It's lightweight and comfortable to use for smaller tasks like whipping just enough cream for hot cocoa.
It's length and small size make it a great size to use with my smaller pots.
It's the perfect size for making a couple cups of homemade pudding for dessert and makes quick work of getting rid of lumps in gravy.
Love this whisk, the grippy handle is perfect!  I needed a whisk that wasn't too big and to use for when I make hot chocolate.
This fits my hand very nicely and is a good quality kitchen tool.
This whisk reaches into the corners of small pans, is just right for mixing a few eggs or incorporating ingredients into a pan sauce.
I'm a hero at home for making this purchase.
Assuming the quality of this item is just as good as it was 5 years ago..then this little whisk is essentially perfect.
As far as I can tell it's still in perfect condition and of course it's quite comfortable to use.
What more could you ask for from a cheap little whisk in this day and age?.
So much easier than trying to use a fork to make omelets and such.
the loops are strong and well spaced to provide optimal whipping/mixing action, yea.
Excellent whisk - buying one for my daughter!!.
but since I'm lazy and this is dishwasher safe, it wins by default.
Use it to whip your eggs into shape!.
I love this whisk! The handle is a comfy rubber that doesn't tire your wrist.
It more tines than any other whisk I've owned which is a good thing because eggs and cream whip faster.
This is a sturdy, well-designed product, just what I would expect from OXO.
Food doesn't get stuck in the area where the wires meet the handle and nothing on it rusts.
To be honest, I don't use it much so I can't comment on how it holds up to heavy use.
I use this for small jobs that I don't want to get a hand mixer our for.
I love the fact that it is metal and not nylon, but I wish the very end had a bit of a pointed tip.
It would make it much more useful when making gravy on a saucepan on the stove.
Other than that, it is great and makes awesome pancakes and scrambled eggs.
The handle is great and the whisk pieces actually move to contour to the bowl.
This is by far the best whisk I have ever owned.
OXO is known for its quality and this product doesn't disappoint.
The whisk is well-constructed and the design is exactly as you'd expect.
This whisk is really well-made and so far I am really pleased with its usage in my kitchen.
It is very sturdy and does a good job!.
No but seriously it's so great as you can imagine; dropping the boring old egg in the bowl and using this whisk.
You start bouncing and swirling and realizing you need the music on because your body just won't stop dancing with this thing.
Time to invite people over for the party, It's to bad the balloon whisk didn't come with balloons.
Gonna Gonna Gonna, forget the future what about now.
We should start now, so I mean tomorrow not in the future.
I am a fan of OXO products and this whisk is no exception.
Very well made and the handle has nice feel.
This whisk is kept in a jar with my other frequently used kitchen tools so it can be quickly accessed.
Trust me, not all whisks have wires sealed in at the base!Well, he was right.
This whisk is so stury, I doubt I will ever have to buy another.
It's also a good medium size, versatile for eggs and everything else I've ever needed a whisk for.
I've used used this several times (mostly scrambled eggs) and love it.
I like the fact I don't have to worry about it rusting if it stays in the water a few days.
Not gonna tell you about my cheap 'melted' spatula!Good product.
This whisk is great!  It is much better than I expected and better than any other whisk I have owned.
It is good quality and easy to hold.
I just bought a second one and am throwing out my 2 old bent out of shape rusty bottomed ones.
This is great and covers all needs and I use it for everything from eggs to whatever- beautifully made and cleans well.
This whisk was top-rated by America's Test Kitchen after testing several.
I took a chance and couldn't be more pleased.
Its great for thin ingredients and works well on recipes that are thicker.
Good quality excellent just what I had been looking for.
Where I live we only have a Walmart and the do not carry any thing close to this quality.
I would think that the rubber would burn off with little issue.
Apart from that, this is quite a nice whisk.
I love this OXO Grip whisk .The handle is perfect for my older hands.
Both are a plus in making the job quick and easy.
I'm so glad I took a chance on  this one and bought others to go with it.
I have many OXO utensils, and so far I have very few complaints.
My previous whisk was a &#34;dishwasher safe&#34; stainless steel handle model - that fell apart after a few washings.
This whisk seems very solid and well balanced - but I will probably hand wash it, just in case!.
I didn't choose the whisk life it chose me.
I am known for my shakes (hand shaking, that is).
I'm not talking about the greeting, but rather my Essential Tremors.
Most of my siblings have this unfortunate gene, but I am the one who gets called out for it most often.
I thought I was hopeless, until that one faithful morning.
I went to check the kitchen for some raw energy.
I cracked the eggs in a bowl and out the bread in the toaster.
All the forks were dirty, so I had to use a whisk.
I broke out the good ole Balloon Whisk and got to work.
I noticed that my whisky ability was very powerful, and I could whisk the eggs up in about 5 seconds.
I can whisk anything at a high power.
I am no longer The Shakiest Gun in the West, but rather the Quick Whisk.
And, just like Thor wields Mj&ouml;lnir and Aragorn handles And&uacute;ril, I carry the OXO Whisk of Justice.
Even though, I haven't found a way to use my powers against criminals, I have found a way to rid of the pettier things.
If you have some pesky ants that continue to make a hill on your lawn, I can whisk away their evil doings in a flash.
Also, if you think cobwebs in your house is a problem, just give me a ring, and I'll be over quicker than I can whisk.
I also work at social events and birthday parties.
It's a whisk-y business, but someone's got to do it.
The rubber handle stops it from going anywhere.
Nothing worse than trying to dig a utensil out of batter.
I'm glad I did because I saved about 25%.
I have used it a number of times and, in my view, it out performs all of my other wire whisks.
I like that there are different lengths of this whisk.
Seems to be a good product so far.
sturdy whisk that does the job nicely and w/ ease.
I bought the smaller version as well and like that one too.
Love all OXO products, and this is no exception!.
OXO never disappoints with their products and this is no exception.
This whisk works great, it feels comfortable in the hand and has just enough give.
When I purchased this I didn't realize how big it was but that's okay.
It was the first whisk I have ever owned and I really love it.
The handle is comfortable for me - no arthritis yet, but I am getting older.
This is a very nicely built whisk, especially considering the price.
The wires are bonded well to the handle, which is easy to grip and feels sturdy.
The whisk performs well and is easy to clean.
Nicely sized -- not too big, not too small.
This is no exception -- a great value, and highly recommended.
This Whisk works great, and cleans up easily too.
The grip on the whisk is pretty amazing - the balloon shape helps me with whipping egg whites.
Has a nice grip and design, seems sturdy.
Like all whisks can be difficult to wash.
Love the handle, not uncomfortable and whips perfectly.
I love to cook and had a previous whisk, well known brand, but the whisk part broke off at the handle.
So far my wrist wears out well before this whisk ever will!.
A whisk is not a complicated device so there is not much I can say about the performance of the whisk.
I mention that last part because I am left-handed and my wife is right-handed (a wee touch of humor).
We have yet to be disappointed with an Oxo product and don't expect that to change.
This whisk seems to be well built and sturdy.
It has a little weight to it, which I like.
The grip fits well in my hand and the material is easy to hold, unlike some of the smooth plastic grips.
It is not the least expensive whisk you will find, but it does seem to be worth the extra money.
I really like this - easy to hold and mix with it.
I have arthritis in my hands and Oxo Good Grip tools work the best for me.= best product for a great price.
I have to say I was surprised at how good this grip feels - it really does!Good, sturdy whisk.
I seem to gravitate towards OXO because I've always been happy with their products.
I got it after seeing it reviewed by America's Test Kitchen, and after getting fed-up with my silly silicone whisk; it's really good.
I didn't think there's such a thing as a &#34;better&#34; whisk until now, but this one kinda proves me wrong.
It is better than the one I had.
This balloon whisk, purchased from Amazon, is what I needed for larger and more weighty ingredients.
It's very comfortable, does the job and I  recommend it for those with or without arthritis.
Well, I own a bigger whisk so I guess that's what I was expecting.
Like all their other products, it is well made and the handle is comfortable.
I always check America's Test Kitchen to see what they recommend and they said this one, so got it.
It is really nice and easy to use.
This whisk was recommended by America's Test kitchen.
This is a great whisk as it has more wires than most and has a comfortable handle.
I also bought the silicone version for my teflon pans.
Light but sturdy; well-made and as expected with OXO Good Grips brand.
It does grip well and I really enjoy using it.
It gets the job done! 10 out of 10 for me.
I love OXO products as they are so comfortable.
I use this all the timeand am very happy with the quality.
They are well made and feel good in the hand; your hand will not cramp during a long stir and won't slip off either.
I bought this almost two years ago, and have used it almost daily since then.
It does a fine job and is holding up very well.
I had been wanting to get a whisk and saw this one recommended by CI.
i shouldve been on there marketing team for such a catchy line to this review.
you can throw it in the washer and not worry about it.
i actually keep it in a canister on my counter because i use it so much.
I've been using whisks I can get for $1, but the Oxo Good Grips 11-inch Balloon Whisk was a very good investment.
The cheap whisks I have used before have felt like they are bending in pancake batter.
Nice ergonomics if you are going to hand wisk vs.
Looks good and holds up well after repeated use.Purchase again?  YES.
I couldn't decide between the 9" or 11", but I bought this one first to see if it would work for smaller jobs.
This whisk is perfect for baking because it aerates so well and is sturdy and comfortable.
It doesn't work as well on just one or two eggs, but I still use it for now.
The big plusses about this particular whisk are the handle and construction.
When i'm preparing egg whites or baking, the handle makes a huge difference so I can continuously whisk.
If you are planning to whisk egg whites at all, make sure you get a good grips whisk, whatever the size and shape.
Also, a rounded, uncoated, copper bowl is mandatory.
If/When this one wears out I will replace it with another OXO Good Grips.I use this product.I love this product.I recommend this product.
This item seems to be strong and sturdy.
I expect it to last a long time.
I like it because the handle doesn't slip out of my hand.
Great quality and I love the gripper handle.
I have purchased several types of whisks in the past year, and this by far is my favorite.
It is very well made, feels sturdy in the hand.
The grip is padded and thick enough to get a good hold on it, causing much less fatigue during use.
I have had multiple surgeries on my hands, yet I find this whisk very easy to use.
A perfect balloon whisk consists of:  Good balance, a good grip and a sturdy balloon; this has it all.
I've had $30 whisks that didn't come close in performance.
It has a great handle and is dishwasher safe.
It is well balanced and has worked well with everything I have thrown at it - including some fairly thick cookie batters.
I will probably buy a few others of this same style.
I love the handle., the whisk is easy to clean, etc.
I don't know what else to say, but I have to add more words, so there you go, Amazon.
The product arrived on time and in the condition described.
This is the best whisk I've ever had.
It works very well, and it cleans up easily.
I bought it a while ago and it's still as good as new.
It does take up a lot of room in my kitchen drawer, but it's a nice product.
We ate 'real whipped cream' throughout the holiday.
Everyone enjoyed taking a turn with the whisk.
It seems really durable and I think I'll be able to use it for years.
Not much more you can ask for from a whisk.
Whisks are something it seems we can never have too many of; although, we have made do with only one for the last several years.
Finally decided to get another one and used America's Test Kitchen testing in our decision making.
This was their top rated balloon whisk.It is nicely made, very sturdy, and cleans up easily.
I'm not going to lie to you and say that this is something which i use everyday.
If I use it once a year, consider that enough.
I bought it however because I needed one and got it in the mail today.
It is fantastic! It wreeks quality and I know I'll have it for a long time.
This whisk works extremely well, and feels good in your hand.
I have really given it a workout during the holidays-and I really love it.
I have a little arthritis in my wrist and this tool  made things much easier for me.
I now own 4 whisks, and yes, I need/use all 4!  This is my new favorite though.
It actually feels nice when you're using it.I purchased this whisk based on America's Test Kitchen recommendation.
They have never let me down in all my previous kitchen purchases, so I did very little research on the product before purchasing.
It's a plus having the easy grip handle but still having the wire wisk as opposed to the plastic wisk.
I love OXO products!  Whenever I replace an cooking utensil or get something new I always look for OXO.
The whisk is sturdy and of course the handle is comfortable as with any OXO product I have.
This is the best whisk I've every used.
It is very comfortable to use with the handle and works like a charm.
It gets the job done much faster than my other whisks.
I will not buy anything but OXO products - very high quality.
Makes all tasks painless for my arthritic fingers.
Like all Oxo products this whisk is high quality and easy to hang on to with a nice non slip grip.
Comfortable handle that seems pretty solid, and it's a good size.
Not so large it takes up the whole drawer, not so small that bigger whipping jobs can't be done.
I wind up grabbing this one for just about everything and it seems to be holding up well.
I have two whisks, this one, and a silicone covered whisk.
This whisk is great to mix things quickly by hand.
The metal wires instead of the silicone just works better.
I use the silicone whisk for like making white cheese sauce or pudding (because of the scrapping the bottom of the pan in high heat).
But the metal is a powerhouse of whisk energy.
When I realized they cook and didn't have a whisk, boy they are missing out.
I've only used this a couple times but it feels good in the hand, easy to clean and is durable.
Why buy this over another brand? I've rarely been disappointed with any of the OXO products.
Buy quality.Buy OXO you won't be dissapointed.OXO makes some of the best products for the price-I own a lot of them!.
What a great, handy gadget to have in your kitchen.
It's so much easier than getting your mixer out, plugging it in to mix something simple...like scrambled eggs.
Love this whisk!!!!! Made well and does it's job properly.
I would gladly recommend this to anyone I know.
You can get this at BBB for a bit cheaper with 20% coupon.
Whipping can be a tiring, hand cramping ordeal but this balloon whisk is very comfortable to use, works great, easy to clean.
The good:  The rubber handle is more comfortable to grip and ergonomic, and the metal tines are sturdy and clean up easily.
I have some other Kuhn Rikon whisks that are fancy and much more expensive.
They're nice, but I keep reaching for the OXO.The bad:  It doesn't stay upright in the pan when you put it down.
It keeps sliding into the pan, so you need to set it aside on a plate or trivet when cooking.Overall, my favorite whisk.
The grip is nice and is comfortable in any position held.
I am loving every minute of it it is super sturdy and extremely well made and not to be big.
We saw it being favorably reviewed on a PBS cooking show, so we ordered one here.
It is comfortable to use, and does a nice job in the mixing bowl.
When they say 11 inches they mean 11 inches from bottom of handle to tip.
The wires are not extremely rigid like the cheapies, but they don't feel like they are going to bend either.
They have just the right amount of give to make whisking together ingredients a snap.
As Norah Jones is singing something about love being a lost balloon, I am sitting here contemplating the sheer beauty of this whisk.
Not only is this my new favorite whisk, it is truly well made.
With a bit of pressure, you can whisk into every inch of a saucepan.
I highly recommend it and I use it a lot.
This OXO is my versatile, go-to whisk; the first tool for which I reach in a variety of food prep applications.
It is the perfect size, weight and design to move rapidly in incorporating more air into scrambled egg preparation, for example.
I own a variety of whisks, but the OXO Good Grips is the only one I keep handy on my counter top.
Excellent whisk! Nice soft feel and most importantly does exactly what it should do.
Small enough and good-looking enough to, and good value for the price.
Have been using for many months now, and no problem faced.
My old whisk had 5 wire loops that would jam into each other and bend funny (piece of junk).
The Good Grips 11" balloon whisk has 10 wire loops that don't come into contact with each other, allowing for more thorough whisking.
The plug in the handle where the wire loops go though is heavily sealed, keeping it very sanitary.
Also great for large gravy making at Thanksgiving.
Other than discoloration of the wire loops (after much use and dishwasher cleanings) it still looks and feels new.
It's such a reasonably-priced item in comparison I hardly consider that a negative.
It works well for larger pots of sauces, etc.
Not good for needing to get close to the edge on a pot.
There are smaller whisks that get closer to the edges.
They withstand a lot of use and are very comfortable to use.
No clumping up at the nose of the whisk.
Now I need a smaller one that works as well, and one in silicone to protect my pans.
After reading a review of kitchen equipment on the "serious eats" blog I decided to pick up the OXO 11" balloon whisk.
Just like the review said, this whisk is light-weight and with the rubber handle very easy to handle.
Unlike the whisk I had been using, which was a tad on the heavy side, this is a breeze to use.
After making a number of poor choices I finally hit on a good product in this OXO Whisk.
The handle is very easy to grip and we find that the 11 inch size is perfect when making sauces in a Saucier pan.
Quality seems to be very good...we are happy with this one!.
This is a really nice balloon whisk, it will be perfect for making eggs or batters.
Really sturdy and not to difficult to clean.
I needed a whisk and this fit the bill.
I bought this OXO Good Grips whisk in the 11" size thinking it would be good for many uses.
This OXO Good Grips 11-inch Balloon Whisk is great.
It fits the hand well and is easy to use and clean.
And, I wouldn't buy anything that wasn't dishwasher safe.
This is now my first go to wisk.
This whisk is well balanced allowing for easy whisking.
It has withstood many runs through the dishwasher without collecting water in the handle like other whisks I have owned.
Now I just need a smaller version to go with this one!.
At 50-something, my hands are beginning to ache, but I still cook, though sometimes I get my son to open jars for me.
This whisk is great because it is soft on the hand and doesn't require much pressure to control it.
It also happens to be a great whisk, doing what a whisk should do and doing it well.
Then, when you are done, you can pop it on the top rack to clean.
Can't go wrong in the kitchen with this brand.
Durable, functional and a good grip! Have used for some time now and still good as new.
Easy to grip, easy to clean, and makes my omelettes fluffy.
This is a great whisk, and that's about all you need to know.
it does not lie when it says &#34;good grips&#34;.
Kind of wish it had a hole for hanging.
A flat whisk is nice for getting stuff mixed at the bottom of sauce pans, etc.
That said, I have not put it to many tests and it's really only meant for whisking very lightweight ingredients (eggs, liquids, etc).
The parts that set it apart from cheaper whisks are probably the handle and the construction.
The handle is comfortable and has a nice rubbery grip.
As far as construction, it's sealed well where the black rubber meets the metal and the parts are all solidly welded together.
Easy to clean, makes me some super fluffy eggs.
Has held up well so far, and the construction is tip top.
the oxo good grips flat whisk is perfection! I mostly use it to make sauces! This is the best flat whisk on the market!.
This is a great tool to have if you frequently whisk wet and dry ingredients together.
With a normal balloon-type whisk, thick batters can get stuck in the middle, but that can't happen with this.
I use it a lot for pancake and waffle batters.
Just the right size for whipping up some eggs.
The flat whisk fits the utensils drawer well.
The handle is great and comfortable to use in any position.
This is one of my most-used cooking tools.
Hasn't rusted like other cheap brands that I've bought in the past, would buy again.
Works for what I need it for, but I don't need to whip volume into anything very often.
The have to have kitchen utensil when cooking any rue, sauces, gravy, etc.
It is simple yet makes all off your stove sauces come out perfect.
This is super for 1 reasons:1 - It is a flat whisk and the flat whisks have always worked great for me.
Has a grippy handle like many OXO products, but small enough to allow various handholds.
One can wisk and lift simultaneously allowing excellent aeration.
The flat shape permits scraping a roux or omelette off the bottom of a cooking surface which evens the cooking of a thickening liquid.
Although it's metal it does not scratch a pan when held flat, even nonstick, as there are no sharp surfaces on the wire.
Because of the slight bend in the shape it is usable as a spatula.
The flat design means all surfaces of the wire can be easily reached for cleaning and it stores more compactly.
I really love using this whisk with my stanless steel pans.
Wish I could find one coated for all the other pans I have.
Would recommend this  to anyone who makes sauces or gravies.
It has a nice length with balanced handle and nice tongs to reach all the surfaces of a pan or bowl.
I hand wash it and do not put it in the dish washer.
I saw Pioneer Woman use one of these and decided I would try it out.
Should have bought one  of these years ago! Very handy, well made, works great.
I love this whisk! I'm going to buy a regular version as well.
This whisk really stands up to use and isn't flimsy like the one I had before.
This is my first flat whisk and it is very sturdy.
It washes up very nicely in the dishwasher.
especially for the price! Works great with pan sauces and gravies.
If you're looking for a 7-inch flat whisk with 3-inch handle, then you've found it.
This works well for me in small 1-2 quart bowls.
If you deal with larger bowls and pans, I'd recommend looking for a larger whisk.
This works especially well when stirring and making roux.
When blending wet/dry ingredients, a conventional whisk would work better.
Exactly what I wanted and does the job great!  Good price and it was exactly what the description said.
This functions just as well if not better than a normal whisk.
I actually like it better for trying to whisk solids into sticky liquids (sugar into eggs).
I purchased this for my niece who is living on her own for the first time and is exploring her cooking talents.
This wisk is a good fit because it is safe for all types of pans and machine washable.
I recommend this wisk for making gravies and rues.
It works great this morning when I used it to wisk pancake batter and scramble eggs.
Needed a mid-sized whisk as I'm doing more cooking and food prep.
Seems like it will last a long time.
Always best to have the right tool for the right job.
I have been using this whisk for over 10 years and love it.
The very best for making gravy and very useful as a spatula.
"Flat"  Round Wire Whisk is one of the best whisks I have ever used.
Its not perfectly flat as suggested by it's name, and that is a blessing.
The whisks are slightly curved like a serving spoon and makes this whisk unique and almost perfect.
I even use it for scrapping like a spatula and blending like a round whisk constantly.
It is the "  Zyliss Quick Blend Whisk  ".
Check out the reviews and decide for yourself.
It's super well made and super easy to clean.
These are my two favourite whisks and the only whisks i have in my kitchen.I hope my review is helpful.
The price is right and it works extremely well, what is not to love?.
It works better than any balloon whisk for blending and breaking down thickeners or solids.
The handle fits well in my average-sized hand and the Good Grips feature is always a plus.
OXO -- I haven't gone wrong with your brand yet.
I purhcased several of these for my kitchen as well as for friends.
The grip is easy to hold ergonomically and it allows you to whisk without getting tired.
this stores and cleans much much easier than a conventional whisk.
OXO all around (I have found out) has excellent equipment.
The rubber handle is perfect for whipping up food.
I really like the perfect size of it too.
I did not realize how much difference a flat whisk would make when making gravy.
I had been using a balloon whisk and thought it was fine.
The flat whisk is more effective and quicker.
I use this whisk for almost everything that needs mixing! I highly recommend this product.
Handle is very comfortable and whisk itself is sturdy.
It does the job I need it for but the size is silly small.
I guess it permits you to beat one egg in a cup or something.
Just know that you're going to be clumsy with it at first.
Then I realized that I loved it even though I was still spilling a little egg over the side of the bowl while whisking.
Order a spare - we have ordered two! They're not that large and fit in your &#34;other&#34; drawer nicely.
Great for custards, because you need to be scraping the entire surface of the pan to prevent curdling the eggs!.
This is a very good whisk as it get into the corners of the pan much easier than the standard round one.
I never thought I had a use for a flat whisk.
until I ordered this and used it once.
I only wish the handle was a bit bigger.
My hands are big, so it is hard to hold on to when you are whisking fast.
I have one whisk for the kitchen and another one with my grilling stuff.
I will never attempt to clean another whisk.
YOu will not believe how much easier this one make all kinds of jobs.
I have never owned a &#34;Flat&#34; Whisk before.
How did I ever live without one?  These whisks are so wonderful for gravy and so many other things.
The OXO Good Grips brand seems to be of high quality.
I love this whisk and use it all of the time.
Flat whisks are much easier to clean than standard whisks.
Prefer this type to mix pancake batter, cake mixes, and cookies.
Since they are flat, makes them easier to clean and batter does not clump at the bottom like a standard whisk.
I've been using a round whisk for 20 years.
This whisk is easy to handle, gets to the bottom of pans or skillets wonderfully, and is one of my fav kitchen tools now.
Very happy and it does break the lumps  up very fast.
Very handy tool I reach for often when cooking, it doubles as a whisk or even for turning salmon on the griddle.
I'm an OXO fan, so I don't really have anything bad to say here.
The loops of the whisk are firm enough to stand up to any sauce or liquid.
They're not that great for thicker batters, but that's what a regular metal whisk is for.
I use this for scrambled eggs and other foods I cook in nonstick pans and it works great.
Does the job and is easy to clean.
They are sturdy, the handles are made from slip-resistant rubber and they are fairly easy to clean.
I purchased this balloon whisk so that I could finally whisk items while they are in my good non-stick cooking pans, without damaging them.
While they nylon whisk part isn't as stiff as most metal whisks, this does the job very well and I'm happy with it.
We got some nice nonstick cookware and these nylon turners and spoons work great and do not scratch the cook surface.
I went with this one since it's heat resistant and with it being non-metal, I can use it in my non-stick pots without worrying.
Thanks OXO for making such a great product with such a low price.
Now I can stir gravy in a coated skillet and not take a chance on ruining the finish.Thanks for a wonderful product!.
No scraping the non-stick surfaces!  The loops are a bit large/floppy to get a nice fine whisk, but I can live with it.
Baloon whisk do as a ballon whisk does, works good- 10 more words required have a nice day, good luck,.
The OXO Good Grips Nylon Balloon Whisk Is another great product.
The handle is soft, thick and does not slip out of your hand.
Great to whip a sauce or mashed potatoes in a non stick pan.
Great quality, very strong to use in mixing.
I ordered 2 just to be on the safe side.
I do a lot of cooking.Good strong whisk.
My wife can destroy anything in the kitchen.
This whisk saves all of that trouble with its durable nylon making it easy to use and easy to clean and keep looking nice.
Just don't leave it sitting in a hot pan for very long.
I use this to mix my GNC vitamin powders and creatine mixes.
It's large sized, and makes small work of the task.
I also use it to make rues for gravy.
Because I make sourdough bread and starter, I needed a non-reactive whisk to better blend the flour and water when feeding the starter.
Anything thicker than pancake batter, however, will severely test this whisk.
As with all Good Grips products, the rubber handle is comfortable and non-slip.
It also gets points for being dishwasher-safe.Do not get this whisk if you don't already have a heavy-duty one.
This whisk is best used against nonstick surfaces or in cases where you need a non-reactive means of mixing.
It can be used in my non-stick cookware without damaging it.
I find the handle easier to control than the sort of whisk I had before with a smaller, thinner handle.One of my favorite gadgets.
(Hers has not given away yet too soon to tell) Do get this one first.
Hint: Shop around first before you purchase save money!!!.
I love this thing, its sturdy yet made of silicone so it wont scratch your pots and pans when making sauces, gravy and eggs.
This works great and is really easy to clean.
It's great that you can use them for non-stick pans.
This whisk has a comfortable handle, is lightweight, and seems to be strong built.
Works just as good as my metal one with the plus of not scratching.
A must have for all no stick pans...light weight and easy to clean...great addition to my kitchen tools...ok to wash in dishwasher too.
it's great, works well and is sturdy and not flimsy OXO has been a good name.
this is a nice high quality nylon whisk by oxo.
as always with oxo good grip products, this is quality and has help up very well.
i got it because i hate the noise and wear of using regular whisks with my pots and pans.
this works well as a whisk and is gently on my pots and pans.
So you do not need to worry about that!.
I was looking for a whisk that won't scratch all my plastic bowls and coated cookware.
This was a great value and it works well.
It's just as rigid, if not moreso, than a metal one.
I would have liked it a bit more if the tines were a bit stiffer, but otherwise does a good job.
I'll still reach for the metal whisk if I'm not working in a non-stick pan.
As usual, OXo has made an excellent product.
I have arthritis and the handle is so kindly.
This whisk is great for those coated pans that you want to protect and keep in good shape.
It works as advertized and is a value for the money.
I have purchased much more expensive kitchen utensils and have been very disappointed.
This is a very nice piece, good quality and well worth the price.
Highly recommend for all whisking needs, especially in non-stick cookware.
I like this whisk because it can be used in non-stick pans.
The loops are a bit more flexible than on a regular wire whisk, but I haven't noticed that causing any problems.
If you have non-stick cookware, I'd thing you'd really enjoying having one of these!.
It's about as sturdy as a nylon whisk goes.
I am switching from coated cookware to stainless steel so I can use a real metal whisk.
I was looking for a nylon whisk to use in non-stick pans so as not to scratch them.
My only complaint is that it is fairly large to use in smaller pots.
I use it in my nonstick cookware when I have to which something like a sauce or pudding.
I like the handle and it is easy to clean.
This works great in my stainless steel pans and helps me in the kitchen because I have arthritics in my hands.
Takes less effort and take the pressure out of my wrists to use this.
This is a great whisk! Very well made! I have been looking for one to use with my non-stick cookware.
A great tool! I would recommend this one!.
I've had this whisk for almost four years, and it's been working very well for me.
Some people say it's not strong enough to do heavy-duty whisking, but I think that's just a matter of technique.
The nylon is long-lasting and easy to clean.
It doesn't scratch your pots, pans, or bowls.
There are advantages there.But it is a bit thick and it will take some adjusting to that if you're used to wire whisks.
It'll fall out of a bowl if you leave it there and aren't careful.
Nice to not worry about scratching our pans with this whisk.
I purchased this because I noticed that my wire whisk was marking up the enamel on the inside of my Le Creuset pans.
This does the job and leaves no scars!.
I needed a non-steel whisk whenever I make my soup in my non-stick pot.
This is the only one that I found so far and it's good.
I like OXO brand, most of my kitchen utensils are OXO so I have come to trust the brand.
Honestly, this doesn't come out all that often, but it works well, feels good in the hand and is safe with non-stick pans.
Solidly built and cleans up nicely in the dishwasher.
What more do you need or want in a whisk?.
It is great for whisking things in my "non-stick" pans.
I own a lot of oxo products and like them all, and this whisk is no exception.
For the price the quality is good and is exactly what I needed.
I mostly use it to make gravy and it is great at getting the lumps out and scraping the saucepan.
Whisk works well to whisk in pans with heat, hasn't melted, Holds up well in the dishwasher, can't rust, all plastic.
I have used this whisk on eggs, gravy and pudding; it does a very nice job mixing all of them completely and smoothly.
It does not scratch my non stick pots and pans like a metal whisk would.
I really like how it fits in my hand the handle is soft and easy to hold.
This tool has made my life just a little bit easier and that's what it's all about when it comes to any tool.
This whisk has a very comfortable grip, as do all Oxo products, and it does a great job of putting air into the mixture.
It's light weight, but does a fine job.
I use a metal balloon whisk in general, but always hesitated when using it in teflon coated non stick pots and pans.
Also the handle is very comfortable.If you're looking for a good whisk that can be safely used in any type of cookware, here's your whisk.
Simple and effective whisk to use with my non-stick cookware purchased through Amazon.
This is is solid nylon so that won't be an issue here.
The whisk was a little bigger than what I really wanted, but I still like it and use it often.
Finally, a non-metallic whisk that does its job.
I would recommend it to any good cook.
I am so glad to own this whisk, my biggest worry is scratching nonstick pans, and my stainless steel pots and pans.
The handle is also very comfortable to use for consistent stirring.
OXO Nylon products are a great replacement to my metal utensils.
It is easy to clean and doesn't scratch my new pots.
It is dishwasher safe but very easy to clean by hand as well.
It is a useful item in your kitchen drawer.
It works great without having to worry about scratching them with the metal whisks.
I ordered this because my son got me non-stick cookware and I didn't want to scratch it using a regular whisk.
It works great! It's easy to clean, and doesn't scratch my Calphalon Comtemporary Non-Stick Cookware.
It's not good for heavy duty applications, but it is great for a nylon whisk.
Won't scratch your nonstick, and does a great job with whipping.
I ordered this to use with non-stick sauce pans.
I watch the Food Network regularly and noticed that practically every "star" uses Oxo products.
I started off with the pepper mill, and am slowly building my collection.
This whisk works great - I like the fact that it won't corrode and that it is easy to clean.
These are absolutely the best I have ever used.
I tested them for both dry ingredients and liquids with a digital scale and a known to be accurate liquid measure.
This is important to me when baking, especially breads.
The set includes a half-tablespoon and a 1/8 teaspoon, both handy sizes and often not included in sets.
The sizes are in easy to see colors.
They feel good, at least in my hands by having a non-slip surface, good length and substance that should last many years.
I wear a 7-1/2 glove if that gives an idea of scale.
They move freely on the keeper loop, as well as remove and reattach easily.
It doesn't seem like they are going to come apart in the drawer, so this may need an update later.
The black color did not hurt being able to see dark spices, or clear liquids too badly.
I'd like a second set so I have one set for liquids and one for dry ingredients.
I realize that black is an OXO "thing" but I hope they consider offering this product in a lighter color.
I cook/bake all the time and love these measuring spoons.
The "good grips" on them makes them easy to handle.
I've owned them for about a month, and have been hand-washing them and have not encountered the problem.
The 1/2 T measure is great for measuring 1 1/2 t and eliminates using two separate spoons.
I have only had these for a short while but I love them.
I had rubbermaid ones that the numbers wore off so I had gotten these.
I love the added sizes and the sturdy handles.
My review is for the "OXO Good Grips 6-piece Measuring Spoon Set, Black".
I'm willing to use it for dosing of one liquid medication, to me that says it all.
They are going to be part of a gift for a very special person.
They came right away and are just as presented.
I have quite a few Oxo products and have always been pleased with them.
Oxo makes great products.I really like the color measurement markings on each spoon, but other reviewers have mentioned the size measurements coming off after use.
I have tried scratching them and they appear that they will hold up.
I hand wash many of my items so hopefully that will never become an issue.
These are much sturdier than metal measuring spoons that I own.
About once a month,  I devote an entire day to making large batches of stews, soups, etc.
in my slower cooker, pressure cook  and on the stove in various large pots.
I then freeze them in smaller packages for future dinners.
I like that the individual spoons snap off of the ring.
All things being equal, I am very pleased with these spoons and I look forward to using them frequently.
I like that these have such a good variety.
The problem with the amounts rubbing off seems to have been fixed by the company.
OXO makes great kitchen tools and this is no exception.
There are plenty of sizes to get the right amount of what you need for your baking.
I highly recommend this, but if you want a measuring set with less sizes on it, the stainless steel one by OXO is nice too.
I purchased these measuring spoons for use with lotion making and I love them.
Everything just slips out, with no muss, no fuss.
My wife needed a 1/8 teaspoon measure for a recipe.
These measuring spoons are accurate, and include 1/8 tsp measure, as well as 1/2 TB measure.
The loop that holds them together will easily snap on or off.
The ovular shape makes it so that they will most likely fit into the mouths of most spice jars.
I have another set of measuring spoons that are made of metal, and are perfectly round.
The perfectly round shape will not fit into my smaller spice jars.
These, however, with the oval shape, sneak right in.
So one of the biggest complaints on this product was the markings wearing off, sometimes very fast.
The markings are raised up, so even if the markings had come of (they haven't) you would be able to tell what it was still.
These are the best measuring spoons I have ever used !! They have brightly colored numbers so you can see what your grabbing.
they are non slip so if you have dexterity problems they are easy to hold onto & they are dishwasher safe.
Who could ask for more? They are a valauble addition to my kitchen !! I'm glad I got them!!.
Great form, great function make this set perfect for our kitchen.
No aluminum here, this is easily maintained and safe to use.
I'm hoping that the marking survive the dishwasher.
I'll try to get back and add another updated review after I've used them for a while.
We do a lot of baking in our household so we were eager to get our hands on this OXO measuring spoon set.
We own other OXO products and find they are high-quality products.These spoons are another solid product.
I like the in-between sizes, as our previous measuring spoon set did not contain all these sizes.
I like most all of Oxo products, so ordered these measuring spoons.
They are plastic, and the set even includes the 1/8 teaspoon (smidge).
They are slightly enongated to help facilitate reaching into spice jars.
They almost look like colored silicone inlaid in the plastic handle, but I'm not sure.
They were a little tight at first, but they've loosened up perfectly to have just the right tension for pulling the spoons off the ring.
I also love the fact that the set includes a 1/8 teaspoon and a 1/2 Tablespoon.
These are really convenient for recipes that you have cut in half.
They will get tiny scratches in them with age, but that's normal for plastic.
I have had a set of the "older" spoons for about 6 years.
The labels have been wearing off gradually, so I replaced them with the newer redesigned version.
What a difference! I love the shape, how they fit into my spice bottles and how they can be taken off of the ring individually.
These are already getting lots of use in our house and i'm pleased to have another wonderful Oxo product in my kitchen.
Contrary to what that little hog Rach Ray claims all cooks need to have a good set of measuring spoons.
That is because it's absolutely impossible to "eye-ball" small amounts of measurements, especially when you're using leavening ingredients.
These OXO Good Grips are probably the very best set of measuring spoons that I have ever used.
I like the fact that they include the color-coded measurements on each.
I did take off 1 star only because the color-coded measurements are starting to wash off.
These are made by OXO, a really great kitchen utensil company.
OXO offers a lifetime "100% satisfaction guarantee" on all of their merchandise.
I have had to implement their warranty on more than one occasion and it was always easy and very simple.
A good set of measuring spoons are just as useful and needed as a good set of kitchen knives.
Account holders wife here:  This is a great set of measuring spoons.
They are easy to read and very durable!.
So, I ordered these spoons and I'm happy I did.
They are great.Here's what I like:-The measurements are now a part of the plastic of the spoon and not just painted on.
(Also color coordinated.)-This set includes the 1/8 teaspoon size.
I will check back if we have any issues with them in the future.
The ring attached to them can easily be taken off.
You can not go wrong with buying OXO brand of cooking accessories.
Happy and highly recommend this measuring spoon set.
What can I say?  They are measuring spoons.
I use them for my fish tanks with my salts, buffers and chemicals.
I have the larger measuring cup set as well and I'm very pleased with both.
They clip securely to the ring and stack nicely within each other.
The classic Oxo rubber grip is a nice touch and I haven't experienced any wearing of the lettering.
I do use these in the dishwasher but I don't use the heat dry function.
What I like the best about this set is how easy it is to take them off the ring (or put them back).
I prefer to have the Tbl and tsp freestanding, and with this set it's easy.
I also appreciate having the 1/2 Tbl and 1/8 tsp sizes, which many sets leave out.
What I like the least about the set, surprisingly, is the color.
But the writing is raised, so I don't expect it to be a problem.
This are so nice and heavy you can just tell they will last.
For the price you cant beat the quality.
I am a fan of Oxo good grips products, and these are no exception.
I have a very nice set of stainless measuring spoons that I adore, but had gotten to the point where I wanted a second set.
I do actually like the "good grip" on these.
Who would think you'd care for measuring spoons! But they're flexible in a pleasant way, and I do appreciate this about them.3.
Six sizes, not just four: 1 T, 1/2 T, 1 tsp, 1/2 tsp, 1/4 tsp, and 1/8 tsp.Indifferents:1.
I really love love love my stainless, but these are quite good.
Excellent product! I loved it! I can measure exactly all the ingredients and it's perfect to help me count my calories.
I knew OXO was a good brand and I liked the black color so I bought these spoons and they are just what I needed.
I like that it comes with 1/2 T (which is 1.5 tsp so you don't have to use 2 spoons for that).
I don't keep mine on the ring but it is very easy to snap them off and on.
Oxo usually makes quality products, but these measuring spoons are even a cut above expectations.
The handle is open so the spoons can be detached and reattached to an oval ring, for use of use and storage.
The measurements are clearly marked on the handle in a contrasting color, too.
My sister asked for black measuring spoons and cups for Christmas.
Oxo is a safe bet for reasonable products at fair prices and these spoons are no exception.
There are six spoons in the set with all the sizes you could want.
They are quite sturdy and will likely last a long time, though the thick plastic construction keeps the spoons from nesting.
This makes them take up more space in the kitchen drawer.
Because of their large size, they can be difficult to fit through small openings.
Mine were battered; half of them were missing...all the things that happen to a kitchen product that's been used for over 2? years.
The 1/8 teaspoon is more useful since baking recipes I make do use that measure for salt and leaveners.
i pick a size, massage the handle ever so gently.
i dip it in the jar lightly shaking off any excess.
quit sending me requests for reviews of benign products lol).
Great to have for any kitchen because they come in handy for many applications.
I have had my set for probably a few years now, and they look as good as the day I bought them.
That being said, I honestly haven't used them very much, and when I did, I didn't wash them in the dishwasher.
I think this is a good set and the ring is easy to open if you just want to use one spoon.
I like these spoons for they are easy to read, light and easy to hang up.
I am quite pleased with the six sizes.
I like the oval shape since it fits better in some containers than a round shape.
Each spoon is sturdy in your hand so spillage isn't a problem and each size is labeled clearly.
Above all, I love the hook size at the top of each spoon.
Most spoon sets have small openings so that it's hard to hang them on a rack.
They have easy grip handles made out of rubber.
The numbers, although I have washed them numerous times in the dishwasher since I bought them, still have not rubbed off.
I also like that they include 6 different sizes as opposed to the steel ones that only have four sizes.
Like the way they detach from the ring.
The 1/8 is great! The shape is very handy for going into containers.
I chose to review this for Amazon because I needed a new set of measuring spoons.
the most convenient sizes.the arms of the spoons are very hefty but mildly flexible and thick for easy griping.
The spoons bowl is stiff to make sure your measurement is true and it is slick so the food being measured slides out easily.
I have arthritis in my hands and find these are quite comfortable to use.
They are also easy to clean.All in all, a good set of measuring spoons at a very affordable price.
I gave these as a gift since I had purchased my own set.
I think this is another great Oxo product.
Serves the purpose, is attractive, and I like the markings on each spoon.
so we were due for some new ones.
The sizes are inbedded in the rubber handles.
I think these will last for a long time with no issues.
I like that they all come off the ring easily too.
I just used these today but others in my family have also used them and we run them in the dishwasher.
These are very nice for folks who have trouble gripping slick surfaces.
The rubber grip on them helps but is not clumsy.
Easy to read sizes but wish the size was more prominent in each spoon.
This set is the perfect one for baking! I would definitely recommend this set!.
So I had purchased the older version of these from another retailer, and the measurements wore off.
I called OXO customer service (since all of their packages say satisfaction guaranteed) and they were sooo nice and so helpful.
They sent me these measuring cups and the measuring spoon replacements no question asked.
I love all Oxo products and even more so since the experience with their customer service.
We have our dogs on a diet and i needed a nice quarter cup measuring cup for the wet food.
The whole set is very nice and the rubber grips on handles is a great touch.
i do a lot of baking, and i love this product.
they scoop, which makes it nice when you're getting something from a canister or straight from the bag.
it's nice having the 2/3 and 3/4 measuring cups as well.
i would buy these again and recommend them.
I purchased this set of measuring cups after I accidentally threw away a 1/2 C measure from a separate stainless steel set.
Even if that were to happen, the measurement markings are slightly raised and stamped ONTO the handles, and would be readable without the colored paint.
The 3/4 C measure is great, and eliminates a lot of unnecessary measuring compared to a 1/4 C measure.
The way they are shaped make it easy for me to pour as well as scoop up.
The fact that they sort of clip onto a ring makes them extremely convenient and easy to remove and use.
I have only had these for a little while but I love them.
I have had no problems getting ingredients out and I have been hand washing and have had no problems with the numbers.
They are sturdy and they include the extra sizes which is very helpful!.
I liked these OXO measuring cups a lot, but there were some features that I didn't care for.
The pluses: I liked the fact that there  was a 2/3 cup measurement.
I also thought that the non-slip grip on the handle was a real improvement over other measuring cups.
However, I disliked and later removed the plastic band that held all the cups together.
Scooping ingredients out is so much easier with the angled design, and they clean easily as well.
The hook on ring makes for convenient storage by keeping the cups together and allowing them to hang from a wall hook.
Somehow misplaced the Cup measurer from our old set so was in the market for a new one.
This one is great, I really enjoy the 2/3c and 3/4c options.
Durable enough, I can even throw them in the dishwasher without fear of fading colors or melting.
Good set, and I haven't come across any major negative aspects.
I have big hands, and they are easy for me to use, which is one reason I chose them.
If I had it to do over again, I'd buy them again.
I love that there is a 3/4 and 2/3 size.
It is awkward to use them all hooked together so I store them without the ring.
These are sturdy, raised measuring sizes, rubber coated handles so they aren't slippery and you can put them in the dishwasher.
I had been looking for a long time and I am delighted with the set.
Most measuring cups do not come with that size.
The measurement markings are very clear to see.
We bought these to have extra measuring cups at home.
They are very nice and I love the grips that are on them.
They do their job and we haven't had any issues with them breaking.
The OXO Good Grips 6-Piece Measuring Cup Set comes with all of the measuring cups hooked together.
They are easily separated, but I've decided to just let mine rest inside each other without the hook.
If I were going to hang them, of course, I would need the hook.I love the shape and weight.
Even though they are plastic, they do not hold grease and oil like some other plastics can.
The shape is perfect and they are well-balanced.
I like having a measure for 3/4 cup, too.
It's better than having to measure 1/4 cup three times, or having to use the half and the quarter measure.Get rid of the ring.
These measuring cups have an easy pour side, are dishwasher safe, can be hung from the right or stored together.
They survived the top rack dishwasher and even once being accidentally put in the cutlery basket.
PLUS it came with a 2/3c.and a 1/4c.
you gotta have them! this and the spoon set, they are fantastic!! easy to clean, use and store, you will love them.
I gave these as a gift with the measuring spoons.
These are so nice and durable and easy to read.
They would make a great bridal shower or housewarming gift.
I bake frequently so when my old measuring cups broke it was time to buy some new ones these are perfect for all measuring needs.
I'm used to using measuring implements with a bit of weight.
Metal, with more metal, held together by metal.
These guys are plastic, and chunky as heck.
The shape of the measuring cups is such that the flour tends to not stick to the corners of the bottom.
Because it's raised, it's going to be exposed to the elements more than it would if it were sunken into the handle.
That being said, because it is raised, there is no pocket for flour to collect in.
VERY handy, so that you don't need to repeatedly do 3 separate 1/4 cup measurements if you want 3/4 of a cup of something.
The loop that they attach to can easily be snapped on or off.
I don't like the cups lassoed together while I bake.
I prefer to unhook them, do my measuring, wash them off, then put them back on the ring for storage.
I bought these as a gift for my in-laws to replace a miss-matched set of measuring cups.
I was surprised by the weight of the plastic after opening them.
Even knowing the major complaint of the numbers washing off.Well, they've been good measuring cups, and the numbers have indeed worn off.
Makes for easier pouring, and easier scooping out of containers.- Now clip onto ring.
Before there was a ring that you had to pull apart, which means you had to thread them on.
These cups have cut outs allowing you to easily snap them on/off the ring.
Before we just threw the ring out since it was a huge pain.
These measuring cups are very sturdy and they look good.
Way nice than the dollar store ones they replaced.
They nest nicely in the drawer and feel good in the hand.
Would buy again in a heartbeat.Well done, Oxo!.
These measuring cups are great because they are elongated and fit more easily into a cannister or container.
Also, if you need to measure 3/8 C, you can do that using the 3/4 cup's 1/2 mark.
I love all the unique sizes that these have.
They are holing up great after 5 months.
Now wear on where the measurements are written and they are raised anyway (so even if they do then you could still see them).
They also have a scoop shape for easy use.
Not sure why they are made so you can pour things out of them as they should be used for dry ingredients only.
I am a guy but I make the World's best chocolate chip cookies.
It is hard to find a 3/4 cup though.
They only had one and had to go to the back to find it.
Well, maybe that is just the spoons but you get my point.
I have searched for over a year for just the right 1/3 cup.
I bake frequently and many recipes call for 1/3 cup of whatever.
I have several OXO  kitchen items and love them all.
THANKS OXO AND AMAZON !!!  You both rock !!!!.
I was pretty worried about buying them at first because you never no for sure if the cups you have are accurate.
They work fine and even though there plastic there not flimsy.
I love the size, it's not the typical 4 size cups, and there are 6 different sizes and an egg separator.
And after cooks gave a good recommendation on these measuring cups I was really satisfied with purchasing them.
This one has all the in between measurements and clip on and off the ring easily.
I hang them on the side of my butcher block and they are very convenient.
I'm a scientist, so the first thing I did was to test the accuracy of these cups.
I placed them on a scale and weighed how much water each one held (1 gram of water = 1 milliliter).
I'm happy to report that all of the cups held pretty close to what is stated.
Unless I'm baking, in which case, a gram scale is really the only way to go.
It is next to impossible to find fault with almost anything that OXO makes.
Sometime ago I bought a set of OXO measuring cups and have been delighted with them.
I did not think that OXO could do better and I am pleasantly surprised about the new set.
It has 5 cups and a holder unlike 4 cups and no holder from the first set.
The handles are perfect for my hands and the softness of them assures me that holding the cups will not result in spilled goods.
The reason is that these are oval and not round.
Oval cups provide me with better handling and sometimes that is critical.
The walls are about the same but the news ones are a tad bigger.
I washed them in the dishwasher and that worked well with no issues.
I like the holder and the way it keeps the cups together.
All together this is a well made and useful set of measuring cups that is useful in almost any kitchen or garage.
They are slighted slanted to allow easy access to dipping out of sugar and flour bowls.
They are the exact measurement allowing for taking a butter knife and leveling off the top of cup.
They have the measurement printed for life in red on each measuring cup.
They are just perfect and can easily be taken off the ring for separation.I highly recommend these quality well made measuring cups.
I had two sets of measuring cups:  1 plastic and 1 metal.
The handles are comfortable to hold and I have faith these will last me a long time!.
By request I received this set of "Oxo Good Grips Soft Measuring Cups, Set of 7, Black" as a recent gift.
The point is to replace three sets of measuring cups already on hand with one cup missing from each set.
What I love about this set is the inclusion of other fractional measures.
In fact, I didn't know there were white Oxo cups until I was looking for the product to write a review.
All my appliance and kitchen do-dads are white.
However, I'll make do--the black measuring cups are quite handsome.
I USE THESE CUPS ON A DAILY BASIS AND THEY ARE WELL MADE.
OXO IS A WONDERFUL BRAND NAME PRODUCT, WELL MADE AND WORTH THE MONEY.
THIS IS AN A+ SELLER AND PRODUCT.THANK YOUSINCERELYJODI.
Scooping dry ingredients is pretty easy with the angled front lip and overall I'm satisfied.
They even have a 2/3 and a 3/4 cup (never heard of that before).
This set has a 1/3 cup and a 3/4 cup measure which my other sets lacked.
Although a kitchen veteran, I'm relatively new to baking.
And that's what Oxo has created here.Before, I've had scoop sets but they were round or cylindrical.
For style and precision, they're a Porsche 911 to the dollar store's Yugos.
I like the design of these measuring cups, which stack together well for storage.
This 6 piece set of measuring cups comes in handy in the kitchen.
When baking and you need to get the measurements correct these cups are what you need.
They nest together and snap onto the retaining ring.
We really like these measuring cups because they include a 3/4 cup measure.
Most sets do not so you must use the 1/4 and 1/2 cups to get 3/4.
I like the highly visible outside markings the best.
There are lines for lesser measurements inside each cup also, adding even more flexibility of use to EACH piece of this set.
All of the cups sit in a neat stack and snap snugly onto the ring to keep them together more securely if needed.
I do think the set is bulkier compared to the old Tupperware design, but this set really &#34;measures up&#34;  LOL!.
These are very easy to use and high quality measuring cups.
These cups are great ergonomically and are light to hold.
They are dishwasher-safe but I always hand wash them as it takes 3 seconds.
I have had this set for a number of years now and they are my "go to" measuring cups everytime I cook.
What I love about them is the addition of the 2/3 and 3/4 cup measures.
You'd be surprised how often that is what a recipe calls for!  For dry measurements like flour, I often only need to rinse them clean.
This set of measuring cups is a cut above most collections, because it includes 1/3 and 2/3 measures, too.
The amounts are clearly marked in a contrasting color on the handle.
The cups are attached to an oval ring by open hooks that are easy to detach and reattach after use.
This is a nice set of measuring cups, with comfortable handles and convenient, in-between sizes.
The one caveat is that the most-used ones, you will eventually have the number wear off.
Well worth the money, and perhaps nail polish could replace the markings that wear off?.
I purchased these because they were an inexpensive.
They continue to be inexpensive and quite serviceable in regular use.I agree that the numbers do come off after a bit (18mo maybe).
I've had no problem telling them apart without labels.They come with lots of different sized cups; however, I take a different view of this.
I have a small kitchen and enjoy getting the most out of the least.
Thus I've kept only 2 of the 7 cups (1/3 and 1/2) in my kitchen.
I've had no ill effects from this choice.
I view this as evidence that all other cups are unnecessary.
It is not as easy to half the volume of an irregular shape as a regular shape.
This makes it "harder" to do without the other cups.
That said the longer skinner shape is good for getting down into storage containers and getting out things like brown sugar.Bottom Line: Recommended.
This drawer appears to be a pretty standard pre-fab cabinet depth, so I suspect many people would discover the same.
Having to keep it one drawer below is no huge deal, but ideally, they'd be right there with my other primary kitchen tools.
So, maybe this time around I won't be hunting for my lost measuring cups since they're easier to take apart and put back together.
But I really like the nesting ability of the cups.
It's handy to have the "odd" measurements.Since I had wash my dishes, I cannot tell you how they fare in the dishwasher.
What I can tell you is that they are a decent value for the purchase price.
I have no issues with them, and don't anticipate them.
My sister asked for black measuring spoons and cups for Christmas.
I use the 3/4 measure for my cereal portions.
Oxo is a safe choice for good products at reasonable prices and that's true of these cups.
There are six in the set so pretty much all of the sizes you might need are covered.
The shape is elongated instead of round, so they may be an easier fit into some canisters than round measures.
They are also a little bit bulky compared to metal measuring cups.
That's why I am only giving them four stars.
I finally had to capitulate and buy new measuring cups and these are great.
When I got mine, I placed one of them in the top rack of my dishwasher where it has remained since.
I run my dishwasher every night, "light" wash (1 pre-rinse with no soap, wash cycle, and several rinse cycles), Cascade Gel dishwasher soap, non-heated drying.
After six weeks of this treatment, the markings show no sign of wear whatsoever.
The part number on the set I received is 76181.In all other respects, the cups are excellent.
They are sturdy and made of the same easy-to-grip black rubber material that OXO uses in many of their products.
The cups are scoop shaped rather than round to make inserting them into bags, boxes and canisters a little easier.
This item fits nicely in a drawer& can be stored together with the binding ring.
Very durable & accurate.These really do make things a bit easier when you need to measure something.
Oxo does make pretty well made products & this item fits in with the other products that they offer.
These are very good quality cups and I would buy them again if I ever had the need.
The numbers are still all there after 2 years of use.
I've even had them fall to the very bottom of my dishwasher during the cycle and still the numbers are firmly attached.
The ingredients have always come out just fine for me.
Most importantly I love the variety of sizes included.
In fact I am planning on getting a second set to help on those days that I do a lot of baking at once.
I even went out and bought the matching measuring spoons.
Like the way this is made so they seem to pour out better.
The older ones didn't have that and were a mess when using with liquid.
These are much much easier to work with.
I'm glad they included several sizes in the set, since they are very useful for baking.
I haven't had any problems with the numbers rubbing off from washing them in the dishwasher, but I'll update if that does happen.
My old set had that feature, and I found it to be really handy.The inside is very smooth, so they wash up like a dream.
As plastic measuring cups go, these are attractive and easy to use.
The Oxo is more sturdy than most others.
The edge is angled, allowing for better compaction when scooping the ingredients.
Most others will perform the same function with different price points based on the materials used and the manufacturer.Overall, I would recommend these measuring cups.
A less expensive set would also work fine, but Oxo does deliver additional functionality and style.
I have have had several sets of measuring cups, both metal and plastic, including those famous home party brands.
They all do the job, I guess, but they all pale next to Oxo.
All of the cups sit firmly, without being the least bit "tippy" both when empty, or when filled with dry ingredients.
These cups are the best designed measures that I have ever used, and they are taking front and center in my baking cabinet.
We have used these for several months now and are completely satisfied.
Each cup easily detaches from the ring that holds the set together for individual use (and also easily reattaches after use and washing).
The handles are soft, and easy to maintain a good grip.
They are also sturdy, and do not flex or sag when filled with ingredients.
They are more oval than round, and this makes it easier to scoop into dry ingredients.
All the cup measurements appear to be accurate, though we have not tested this.
We have not had any problem with the measurement markings wearing off, even in the dishwasher, unlike apparently some others have.
just what we were looking for!  they're not pampered chef or pottery barn showy, but they're heavy and durable.
They stack perfectly, and the shape of them makes them exceptionally easy to use and level.
They also wash well by hand or dishwasher.
The measuring cup are no different than any other set except OXO has added some features to make them better.
I have been looking for a measuring cup set that had the 3/4 cup measure and this set had it.
They are actually a very good set, easy to read the size and they work well for scooping.
These spoons are easy to hold and use.
The measurements printed on them are easy to read and hold up in the dishwasher on the top rack.
I really like the rubber handles and the fact that they are stainless steel.
I keep them in my knife bag without worrying about damage.
This set was on my daughter's Christmas list, so, I ordered through Amazon.
They are great quality, and, clean up easy.
I bought these because they are made of metal - I was tired of my plastic measuring spoons flying around in the dishwasher.
I really like them and they complete my set of stainless measuring cups.
I do a lot of baking and decided to finally buy some decent measuring spoons.
These are not only gorgeous to look at, but they are easy to keep track of with the snap on/off feature of the ring.
They was in the dishwasher and come out looking like they did before they were used.
I also LOVE the fact that the measurement markings on them are large enough to see easily.
I see these being a part of my kitchen for many years.
These stainless steel measuring spoons beat plastic ones down to the ground.
Metal measuring spoons are nice to have because you can use them in situations that can't be done with plastic.
For example, I make a rice and noodle dish that uses refrigerated chicken stock paste.
OXO does nice kitchen tools, I also have their Y peeler, swivel peeler, apple corer, and so on.
As with every OXO product I have purchased, these measuring spoons are excellent.
Like the comfortable handles and the easy to read measurement marking on the handles, as well.
Normally, I HATE measuring utensils on key rings.
It's usually such a pain to get them off so I can use the one I want, and I end up throwing the keyring away.
The handles are easy to hang on to, and don't get knocked around the countertop if you accidentally bump them since the handle is grippy.
I've read another user's review about how the lettering came off.
There are lots of measuring tools out there, but the way that these are  Brightly labeled, and attached to the ring make them very superior.
I read how they bent and weren't very strong but figured I don't use these things for scooping ice cream or some other abuse.
I do use the table spoon to measure out drops of cookie dough and there was no bending involved.
Much better than my old ones of another maker that did bend.
Love these!! Well made and easy to read.
I'm vision impaired so a plus for me :) very sturdy, wash nice and easy to take apart and put back together.
No more loose  ones in drawer you can never find! Great price too.
Oxo quality has created another welcome addition to our cooking and baking equipment collection.
nice looking goes very well with stainless steel appliances.
What you see in the picture is what you get.
I don't put them through the dishwasher, so I'm not sure how the rubber handle coating would hold up.
They're made of stainless steel and of good quality.
Every baker needs a set of measuring spoons.
the oxo good grips measuring spoons, stainless steel was a good buy for me.
the measuring is easy as well a ease of washing.
i would recommend this product to anyone, especially people with arthritis, due to ease of use.
I do not think that will be the case here where the numbers are a very hard plastic embedded in the soft grippy rubber handle.
These are wonderful! I use them all the time.
My only complaint is that they fall off the ring too easily.
it would be better if the ring opened and closed that way I would not have to look for them in the drawer.
But I eventually discovered that those new spoons WERE NOT ACCURATE! Made in China, of course.
These OXO spoons are accurate, and I've bought a bunch of them, even given them as gifts.
These measuring spoons are very well made and appear as though they will last.
I detest plastic measuring spoons and stainless always ensures that they will clean well with no residue or dullness.
The handles feel good and seem to be holding up well in cleaning.Beyond that, what else can you say about measuring spoons?.
All around great, even my husband commented he like them.
Stylish looking, easy to store - they hang;  plus they FEEL good in your hand.
Rubber grips make them super easy to use.
These look nice and have wonderful silicone handles.
Why do I have to have so many words?  Silly.
All of the measuring spoon sizes are rightbhere at yor fingertips.
This is one of the best purchases I've made through amazon.
I have several Oxo Good Grips products; this is my favorite by far.
The construction is solid and feels good in my hands, unlike the flimsy measuring spoons I've been using for years.
The labelling is superb and colorful and the ring holding them together allows for maximum movement when measuring contents for recipes.
Spend the bucks and get an excellent set of measuring spoons; you'll be glad you did.
They are very durable and will not bend.
The design for getting on and off the ring is the best I've used.
They stay on but come off easily when you want them to.
Dishwasher safe and a design that won't deteriorate.
These are the only measuring spoons I want to use now.
I would give these as a gift without hesitation.
Oxo remains one of just a few brands to which I'm still loyal.
According to Amazon's "Instant Order Update," I last purchased this item September 30,2004.
When you order, put four Oxo items in your cart to take advantage of the 4 for 3 promo and save even more money :).
These spoons are a great quality and work as advertized.
Easy to clean and seem that they will last a lifetime.
My plastic measuring cups and spoons were getting pretty shotty.
I love OXO products, so I decided to buy these as replacements.
They are WONDERFUL! Stainless steel, durable, stylish, easy to clean, and easy to keep track of.I also purchased the set of measuring cups like these.
I love the black grip of each spoon as it makes it easier to manage when using them.
As I get older I notice my eyes getting worse.
The spoon part is actually metal which is nice and seems to measure more accurately.
My only complaint is the set does not include 1/2 TBSP and 1/8 TSP.
Overall, I like theses spoons a lot, they have a good feel to them and are a lot bette than plastic ones.
I wish it had come with a 1/2 tablespoon but it still gets the job done.
For years I have used plastic measuring spoon, but I have been attempting to eliminate plastic from my kitchen altogether.
Plastic measuring spoons can stain, but the stainless steel measuring spoons by OXO are easy to clean, comfortable, and durable.
I love the metal ring that hold the spoons neatly on the inside of my storage cabinet.
Yes, an extra measuring spoon would be nice for the in between size, but overall I am very pleased with the purchase.
Nice measuring spoons! I like the grip handles on them and they work nicely for baking.
I just throw them in the dishwasher and they do not rust.
The handle is great, they come of the clip easily and oil does not stick to them like the plastic spoons.
Love these things!  They look very nice and are easy to read!Not much more to say.
A little pricey, but very comfy to hold on to, and they look very classy.
These measuring spoons look so damn good you will want to put them out on display not in some drawer.
the rubber grips are a nice touch, as is the slotted handles for removing and replacing the spoons on the storage clip.
It would be nice to have a few more sizes included other than the 1 tablespoon , 1 teaspoon , 1/2 teaspoon, and 1/4 teaspoon.
The spoons are sturdy and will last much longer than the ones on a spiral wire that comes apart.
OXO tends to put out good products and this is another example.
The spoons have a flat profile so when they are stacked up, they take up very little drawer space.
The bowl of the spoons have no texture, so ingredients come out easily, even the sticky ones.
I've tossed these around quite a bit and they haven't scratched up yet.
I have lots of measuring spoons, but these have been my favorite.
I just like the stainless look and I like the shape and feel of these best.
I have had these measuring spoons for two years and I love them; they are my "go to" spoons.
As far as I can tell, they are accurate.
They are easy to use and the rubberized grip is definitely nice to have.
I've ran them through the dishwasher dozens of times and the labels with the measurement markings are still clear.
These measuring spoons are perfect; Their accurate and I like how you can slip them on and off the ring easily.
The handles are just like all Oxo good grips handles their soft and give these small spoons some heft making them easier to hold.
One reviewer mentioned that the measuring marks [1 tbs, ect] wears off.
I think that may be because they used the dishwasher to clean them.
I have recently replaced everything in my kitchen with stainless steel mostly Oxo products and these spoons match everything else.
This is a really nice set of measuring spoons.
They are aesthetically pleasing, well-made, and ergonomically sound.
They have been through my dishwasher about ten times already, and there are no signs of wear as of yet.
Also, it would be nice if they expanded the set to at least include 1/8 teaspoon and 1/2 tablespoon.
Overall, a very good set of spoons, and another quality OXO product.
Like the fact they have metal spoon head and handle is the rubber OXO good grips material.
Wash up well and thrown in the dishwasher didn't cause an issue.
Works well, keeps things moving smoothly, and helps to keep clean up faster.
I like metal products in my kitchen, so these measuring spoons are a very sanitary way of measuring your ingredients.
These are the nicest measuring spoons I've ever had, highly recommend, excellent quality, I am going to purchase the measuring cups next.
They have easy grip handles made out of rubber.
The numbers, although I have washed them numerous times in the dishwasher since I bought them, still have not rubbed off.
The only downfall for these is there are only four included.
I have had many sets of measuring spoons, and by far, these are the best yet.
They didn't cost a fortune, and I feel that I'm actually using "Tools of the Trade." I can't say enough good things about them.
Their very strong, do not bend at all, and clean up much easier than I thought they would.
The days of thin, cheap, stainless are over.
I will buy stronger tools from now on, I am that impressed with them.
Last, The name Good Grip really says it all.
They never slide in my hands, and are comfortable to use.
I bought these to replace my stainless steel spoons that were mangled by the garbage disposal.
They are not as sturdy as my previous set but are a nice addition to my kitchen essentials.
I'd give these little things an extra star if they were a bit thicker and more sturdy.
As it is, they've survived through sink disposal trips, dishwashers, being dropped, bent, and otherwise abused.
But the thing is, I don't think they SHOULD bend.
I found a really nice, heavy set of metal measuring spoons at Sur La Table that I like a little bit better.
Though those don't have the nice grips that these ones do.
However, the nicks in the metal can be cleaned up pretty easily with a scouring pad!.
I keep several sets of these little guys for those times when I am really cooking it up and have several recipes going at once.
I can through it in the dishwasher and it comes out great.
I actually found the keyring to be perfect, it keeps them together without making it really hard to detach if you need to.
I suppose a caribiner-style clip would make it better, but I had no issues.
They are well balanced and I think the only drawback is that the metal is a bit thin, so they can bend.
If it were maybe half-again as thick or of a harder steel, it probably wouldn't be an issue.
4 Stars because I don't think they should bend at all at this price.
My wife and I cook a lot and use these constantly.
My only compaint is that there isn't a 1/2 Tbls.
I had to pull out another set to get that measurement.
Saw there was a lot of negative reviews for these things.
Not sure if they changed the model or what, but I think they're just fine.
Bending seems to be the biggest issue, but mine haven't bent yet and seem sturdy enough to last for quite some time.
OXO has never disappointed me, and these measuring cups are no exception!.
I was hoping to carry these in my knife bag...unfortunately the 1 cup is too large.
I keep them at home, they are rather durable and the rubber handles are a bit more comfy than straight stainless.
Living up to the brand name of OXO these are one nice set of measuring cups.
I really don't know how they will not last forever.
They are stainless steel with an attaching ring where the cups could be removed if so desired.
If not, that ring serves to keep all of the cups in one place and together.
There is a hard rubber edging to each of the cups so that they will stay nice and not bend.
Wish you all could see for yourself how truly nice these are.
This is a nice set...I like that they're stainless steel, but given that they're metal I didn't expect that they'd be so easily bent.
Without much force at all they do give.
It's not a huge problem for me since I'll only use them once in a blue moon for baking.
Theres just a little notch and you can pull it off.
The rubber grip handles are great and I like the colored markings, much easier to spot then if it were etched into the metal.
On the whole it's a perfectly good set of measuring cups.
The OXO Good Grips are generally great kitchen tools, well made and long lasting.
I try to bend them and can barely do so, which leads me to believe they've made that portion much stronger and thicker.
The grips do not come off at all, so any past complaints about that feature have been resolved in this new design as well.
I like how these are bent at the tip and form a nice spout to pour from.
The brushed stainless is nice looking and easy to clean.CONS:The clip which keeps these together has a small opening to remove cups separately.
Now I can just dip the cup in or fill it and I'm good to go!  Great product with one minor caveat.
Love the rubberized handle that are easy to grip even if your hands are slippery.
They have a nice weight to them, so I never worry about them getting bent or dinged when they get tossed in a drawer.
Best set of measuring cups I've ever owned.
I love the rubber grips on the ends and the grips are the perfect added accents to these cups.
You will love them for your kitchen or buy them as a gift for your family or friends because they will love them too.
OXO is a New York City based manufacturer of quality housewares.
The company was created by Sam Faber to market ergonometrically-designed product.
OXO products can easily be recognized by their comfortable handles and quality of manufacturer.These stainless steel measuring cups are definitely in the OXO tradition.
They work wonderfully, and I have no problem keeping hold of the rubberized grips.
When measuring something hot, I had no trouble with the handles becoming too warm, which was very nice.
Also, they seem to stand up to the action of my dishwasher very well.
I think that they are great!(Review of OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups, Stainless Steel, Updated Design).
Yes, as pointed out by previous reviewer, this item has been revised.
Now a very thicksubstantial stainless steel, I use one to heat butter on the stove.
You could almostuse this as a tiny cooking pot.
After reading many of the reviews about these cups I was unsure about ordering them, but decided to give them a try.
The ring they are on keeps them in place, and it is easy to snap off individual cups as needed.
They are also heavy duty, and when they re-designed these they did an excellent job.
I do a lot of baking and decided to finally buy some decent measuring cups.
These are not only gorgeous to look at, but they are easy to keep track of with the snap on/off feature of the ring.
They was in the dishwasher and come out looking like they did before they were used.
I also LOVE the fact that the measurement markings on them are large enough to see easily.
I see these being a part of my kitchen for many years.
I bought these with the measuring spoons and love them both.
I love everything OXO and these cups are no exception.
The stainless steel with black grip not only looks sharp, but the stainless keeps the cups from staining.
The angled design of the cups helps them stack nicely and store easily.
This one doesn't disappoint.I like the scoop shape more than the common round.
The size is on the handle and easily readable.Only thing not super is they're a tad hard to get off of the hook/loop.
I like the Good Grips range,  and own quite a bit of them.
They are clearly marked,  easy to wash, there is no plastic to flake off.
I think we will be using them for a long time.
I hate this, as it makes it very hard to "guesstimate" fractional quantities.
The tapered sides are a problem for me, but I like the robustness and comfortable grips.
The metal construction is nice for quick heating of ingredients.Many of the earlier reviews mention the handles bending under load.
I believe these have been redesigned, because the handles seem very resistant to flexing or bending.
I ordered these because we have some of the thinner metal measuring cups.
They tend to bend and loose their shape over time.
These are so sturdy, yet still aesthetically appealing.
The stainless is good quality, the cups for the most part balance well.
Liquids in the 1/4 and 1/3 could easily spill, but most small sizes do.
The lettering will fade in time, but it's pretty easy to tell which size is which.
Overall a very nice product, a little more tinkering and they would be perfect.
This set of four measuring cups is constructed to last a lifetime, in my opinion.
They are really a great kitchen utensil.I love OXO products and especially these measuring spoons.You can also hang them for easy access.Highly recommended!.
I am very pleased with these stainless steel measuring cups.
Tapered, they feature  rubber handles with color coded measurement markings stamped in.
The brightly colored markings are easy to read and are permanent.
The handles are short but sturdy and I have experienced none of the bending complained about in the earlier version.
The rubber does provide a good grip, especially when your hands are wet or greasy.
The set contains four cups in the standard 1/4 cup, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup sizes.
Diswasher safe, they easily snap on and off the plastic ring which makes them convenient to hang.
I like the look and feel of these cups and so far they have not faded, pitted or discolored.
I wish the set included more sizes but for an attractive starter set, they measure up.
I did not find any negatives for this product.
Please check the review date on some of the less favorable reviews.
- as the 2-and-1/4 inch rubber handles do not bend on the 2013 model.
I even checked the volume of the individual cups and they are right on.
This review is for the OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups Stainless Steel, Updated Design version.
4.75 out of 5.I this updated design, the handles are not bendy.
The metal of the cup extends into the handle to the point of the opening for the ring.
There are four cups on a hard plastic ring.
The handles are made of a good grip rubber, with the measuring size painted onto the handle.
Sometimes you get products with a strong rubber smell.
The paint is raised a slight bit, meaning it's a thick layer of paint, so it will last wash after wash.
The metal for the cups is of medium thickness.
The front of the cups (opposite the handle) is angled for easy pouring.
There is no spout, but the angled front helps the liquid pour without running down the sides.
These are great cups for warm liquids/ingredients, and they will definitely last.
The opening at the end of the cups does get in the way when I'm grabbing the cups.
I almost decided to pass after reading about the flimsy handles.
OXO makers appear to have taken customers complaints into consideration and have corrected previous design flaws.The set I received do not have bendable handles.
The improved handles are metal dipped in silicone with the measurement size printed in a bright colour.
I tried to bend the handles and couldn't.
The cups are easy to hold and use.
They don't topple over when full as other measuring cups I've used have a tendency to do.
Moreover, they are attractive enough that I don't mind hanging them from a hook under a cabinet, where they are easily accessible at all times.
I really like the shape of these measuring cups.
You can scoop ingredients perfectly with this particular shape.
I like OXO products because of the rubber grips.
I did take them off the ring because it kind of makes they cumbersome to use.
A real nice surprise about the one cup measure.
I was having a dinner party the day after these arrived and the one cup measure scoops ice from the ice keeper I use.
It will scoop exactly what you need for a glass.
OXO makes great products and they seldom disappoint.
What I like most is that the numbers on each cup are in different colors and they're large enough to be easily read.
Stable and easy to use, really nice measuring cups.
I'm becoming a big fan of OXO products--they are all that good.
The Good Grips measuring cups are a nice heavy stainless steel design.
The slightly oblong shape makes it easy to dip in to sugar, flour, etc.
The handles feel sturdy, are rubberized and have a different color for each measurement.
The icing on the cake....they can go in the dishwasher! Wahoo!!!.
A number of reviewers have remarked that this product has "bendy handles." This is just not true.
Perhaps the company has modified the product since those reviews were written, but I can detect absolutely no problem with the handles now.
I doubt I could manufacture a situation in which these handles would fail.
This is thick heavy-duty stainless steel, and the steel part of the handle is stuck far into the surrounding black rubberized handle coating.
But again, I think the ends of my fingers would give out before even that part of the handle bent.
So this "bendy handles" issue is just all wrong.
You'll also appreciate that this coating makes the handles easy to grip even if your hands are covered with something slippery, like butter.
Naturally, I can work my way around these, but they would be handy and I'd pay an extra price to have that convenience.
I marked product down one point for that reason.Personally, I love the "rakish" look of these cups.
They're slanted outwards (perhaps better to balance the weight of the handle) but this gives them a very contemporary, stylish, and modern look.
The product is well balanced; it easily sits upright on the counter without tipping.Overall, I am extremely pleased with this product.
It is well built and I am sure it will last me a very long time.
I am a very big Oxo fan, and with good reason.
Their products tend to be of excellent quality, and usually are not expensive.
And they also listen to their customers.Case in point, these redesigned measuring cups.
The original design was OK but had issues, particularly the handle which was longer and could bend.
Previously the marking were in ink, like most measuring cups, and of course the ink rubs off over time.
The new markings are molded into plastic on the handle.The set includes 4 cups (1, , 1/3, and  cups).
While these cups cost more than your typical plastic measuring cups, they are very nice.
The handles are also metal, with a plastic covering on most of the handle.
Each handle is marked: 1 cup,  cup, 1/3 cup, and  cup.The handles of all four cups connect together with a plastic ring.
Unlike most cup sets, the cups can easily detach from the ring by snapping off and back on.
So nice that you could actually leave them out in a utensil set, etc.
More importantly, they handle very nicely, ingredients like flour, sugar, etc.
They are nice to use, balanced I suppose, and the rubber grip helps too.
The cups attach to a ring by way of a notch in the cup handles.
I don't keep the cups on the ring because to me it's a hassle wrenching them off to use them.
but I can see where having them on the ring would be handy for hanging if that is the method of storing.
So what is important when reviewing measuring cups.
These are very easy to handle with a grippy holding section.
Always felt secure no matter what I was pouring into them, even when using some liquids.
These are solid little measuring cups and seem like they should last years.
These are very easy to clean due to their design.
They stack into each other which is a no brainer for measuring cups.
Overall these measuring cups tick all the right boxes and are very reasonable priced.
Also I have a bunch of OXO products already.
These are nice sturdy measuring cups, and the company has clearly fixed the handle problem.
These measuring cups have sturdy handles with nice clear quantity markings on the handle.
These are definitely more attractive, and would probably be pleasing to those who care about style.
I am always a fan of OXO products--in fact, I already own a 6-piece set of their measuring cups in the old black design.
The stainless is ideal, yet the black rubberized handle not only looks good, but also is practical as well.
So instead, I have these cups nestled in my drawer.
measure, which I LOVED--I wish this set did as well!  For that reason, I rate this set 4 1/2 rather than a full 5 stars.
They are just as they were presented and came right away.
They are going to be part of a gift for a very special person.
It seems like I use a lot of measuring cups when I work in the kitchen, particularly for bread baking.
They easily just slip right off the ring and go right back on again with no problem.
Personally, I prefer to keep them off the ring.
They work well either way.I love the shape and convenience.
f you want measuring cups that are going to last for a very long time, these OXO measuring cups are for you.
The stamped measurements will last and won't disappear after numerous washings.
Looking over past reviews, it appears that there was a problem with bendable handles which OXO has since fixed.
These redesigned measuring cups don't have that problem.
I found the rubber handles easy to use - the cups are easy to grab and hold onto - even with wet hands.
In the past I've always gone for the cheapest set of measuring cups I could find.
Then I've watched over time as they've become stained, warped, and useless.
Sometimes, it's worth a little more to get the best, and these are the best.
They look great, they measure perfectly, they feel good in the hand when you hold them.
As usual OXO has set the bar high with their excellent looks and function.
These things are absolutely aesthetically beautiful and made out of wonderful material.
They do not scratch easily and do not get dirty easily, either.
When they do get dirty, they are a total breeze to clean.Very easy to store, too.
Designed beautifully -- inner curved sides make pouring/measuring much easier.
The cups are stainless steel and the handles are black rubber.
They nestle together and attach to a ring.
They can also be detached when being used.
The sizes are 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup and 1 cup.
My old set did have a 2/3 cup size, but I suppose just using the 1/3 cup twice is easy enough.
I just wanted to mention this incase it is a problem for someone else.
Otherwise, these are great measuring cups, that should be easy to use and clean.
I have been a cook since I was a young teen.
My first measuring cups were little multicolored plastic.
With the arrival of this set, I have now recycled that set of plastic cups.
They scoop out brown sugar like a hot knife through butter.
What do you say about measuring cups? LOL Each cup measures the right amount? Well they do.
;-) Other than that, these are attractive and overall, very sturdy.
Some reviewers report an issue with the handles bending with a heavy scoop, but I haven't run into that yet.
I don't know if I got mine from a better batch, or if I just hold them differently when scooping.
There is absolutely no question that they will NOT bend when holding a measurement of a liquid.
Individual cups for 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 full cup, which simplified the entire process.
It's not often that a recipe calls for the same measurement of different ingredients, so convenience was greatly enhanced.
These cups are made from a very solid and durable stainless steel, and they have OXO's non-slip rubberized grips, which are very comfortable and secure.
The measuring quantity is clearly marked on each handle in bright color.
OXO's slot method is far more handy and convenient.As always, OXO has taken a great idea and made it even better.
Well done, OXO!A solid five stars (I wish I could rate it even higher).
They are weighted perfectly and are easy to fill up without having to worry about tipping over.
They are tapered towards the front which makes emptying the contents easy once you get used to them (I.e.
They don't have spouts, but that doesn't seem to be a problem.
I bought these for my sister for Christmas as she loves to bake.
She complained that they tip over because of the weight and length of the handle, so she returned them for some others.
This OXO measuring cups are both stylish and useful.
In most every kitchen, a few basic essentials can be found and measuring devices are almost always among them.
The cups are made from steel so they are more durable than plastic and are made to last.
The handles are made with a rubberized coating so they do not slip out of the hands.
You don't need to eyeball things, like you do with a glass cup.
My kitchen is overloaded with stainless steel appliances, large and small, so these cups blend in nicely.
I also like the imprint, showing the individual sizes, because it is more likely to last longer than the markings on other cups.
But a set of individually- sized cups is still useful for it makes dry measurements faster and more convenient.
This set from Oxo is very nice, attractive, and useful and I recommend adding a set to your kitchen.
OXO thought of everything when it came to these measuring cups.
They work well with normal food use, and it is indeed easier to scoop up grains and flour with the tapered out lip.
I agree with some of the other reviewers that the handles might bend when scooping very heavy substances like brown sugar.
For most tasks, however, these measuring cups are fine.
I love the fact that they are dishwasher safe and that the labels are easy to read.
I am very happy with this set of measuring cups - they are a great addition to my kitchen.
I can't imagine the handle bending as others have mentioned.
I tried to bend the handle intentionally and it wouldn't budge.
The ring keeps them together in a cabinet or drawer, but the design allows you to easily snap off each cup to use separately.
Good thinking, OXO!  I'm still partial to my circa 1980 Tupperware set because it has 2/3 and 3/4 cup measures, which are very handy.
I deducted a star from these because the set includes only 4 measuring cups.
We don't own many stainless steel tools, but I am hoping these are good for the long haul.
The grips are always an appreciated feature of OXO utensils and these cups fit and stay in the hand well.
We haven't had any of the bending problems, or some of the other complaints some reviewers have had - time will tell for us.
I suspect we will be happy with these as we are happy with our other OXO kitchen items.Recommended.
OXO Good Grips Measuring cups are a nice quality, sturdy set of stainless steel cups.
The rubber handles make sense when you're dealing with sticky fingers.
I love the soft-grip comfort and design of these OXO Good Grips Measuring cups.
I also like that they are stainless steel and have a unique lip design (see image).
While the slim, stylized design looks good, it feels strange measuring with an oblong cup.
The shape lends itself to pouring out of the top lip vs.
I think it's just getting use to something new in the kitchen.
Now, the first thing I did was take the cups off the plastic oval clip-thing.
Its just to hold them together, so I tossed it.
I never put my measuring cups back together on the holders, I just stack them in the drawer.
Speaking of which, I have standard, contractor-grade drawers and these cups stack just to the edge of the drawer.
This means I have to be careful they are exactly stacked or they wouldn't fit.
The comfortable handles make for a bulky stack.
Overall, they are usable and a nice design for the modern kitchen.
The grip handles are also good for those with arthritis, grip issues, or someone who just likes a comfortable handle while cooking.
Not sure how they would fail functionally, unless they had holes in them.
Every Oxo product I have ever owned has been at least very good, and for the most part, excellent.
I was thrilled to get the chance to try out the updated design.
They have a very sleek look to them and work well.
Aside from the smoother shape, they have changed the O-Ring design that keeps the cups hooked together.
You no longer have to unhook the ring to place and remove the cups.
Yes, my friends, I've murdered plastic items many years along the way.
OXO has obviously heard of types like me.A great set, well built.And did I mention it also accurately measures your ingredients?.
These measuring cups go great with my stainless steel OXO measuring spoons.
There is a way to take them off of the ring, but they do not fall off easily.
I read some of the comments on how these had flimsy handles, but this is not the case for me.
I put these through the dishwasher and no damage was done to them.
I took off one star because for the price, I feel that they should have included an additional 1/8 cup.
If you are a fan of stainless steel and need some heavy duty measuring cups, get these.
This is a *nice* set of measuring cups.
They are sturdy, well made, and feel good in your hands.
I've used these measuring cups several times, and I'm satisfied with them.
They are sturdy, and the cup size-1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 show up against the black rubber handles.
The numbers are in bold colors that stand out against the black and I'm hoping they don't fade over time.
The metal edges are great for leveling out ingredients.The cups clip to a ring to keep them together.
I made some chocolate chip cookies yesterday and used my new OXO measuring cups.
I had a set of their old ones and these ones are much improved.1.
These handles do not bend when scooping, whether it be flour or brown sugar.
I tried to bend by hand and wasn't able to do that either.
Kudos to OXO for this much needed improvement.2.
I don't find these "cups" tippy at all.
They are very secure sitting on the counter even with ingredients added.3.
That are smooth feeling and not rough brushed.
The edges of the cups are smooth and straight, not sharp.4.
The colored measurement numbers are actually embedded in the handles rather than just painted on and should last for the life of the cup IMO.5.
You have to twist and click to get the cups off of the connecting ring rather than just pulling straight out.
I know in our household the ring will probably disappear before too long.6.
The tops of the cups are straight across and it's easy to level dry ingredients with a knife.7.
I do wish there were 2/3 and 3/4 cup sizes.C.
I waited for some time to commit to a good metal set of measuring cups.
I had in my mind the perfect set but was not will to pay a bunch of money towards it.
Nice weight to the individual cups and they separate from the hanging hook easily for use.
I already had similar measuring cups but I figured I could always use more.
These are my favorites, my "go to" measuring cups.
They actually look larger than my other sets - but I checked and the measurements are correct.
I expect they will last a long time! They are a pleasure to use and come through the dishwasher well.
These are easily the best measuring cups I've ever owned.
At first, I was concerned that their shape would cause them to be unbalanced.
and when they're empty, they do tip over easily.
But as soon as they have something in them, they're quite balanced.
Some reviewers have mentioned that the handles bend too easily.
Yes, they are a bit bendy, but not to the point that would bother me--and certainly nothing like the cheap metal cups on the market.
The only thing I don't like about these cups is they don't nest very well.
The cups all fit inside one another, but the handles stick up.
The picture definitely doesn't accurately represent how they look when stacked together.
But overall, I really like these cups, and I definitely recommend them.
I say initial because I can possibly foresee the handles loosening and not staying clipped onto the ring.
I'll explain:These measuring cups have a kind of hook on the handle that is open.
This hook slips onto the included plastic ring.
The cups get wedged on and don't come off.
To pull one off, you just give it a nice tug or twist.
I have since replaced all of my measuring utensils with stainless steel or glass.
No more plastic.I will update the quality as I use them, but my initial impression is that they are very good and worth the price.
I'm at best a limited amateur in the kitchen, but one of my dad duties is to make pancakes on the weekend.
This is usually as advanced as I get to the point of using measuring tools in the kitchen.
In my defense, my pancakes are usually kid exciting having bluleberries, bananas, oatmeal, chocolate or a combination.
(i digress)In a bisquick world, measuring cups count.
They all work and work well - I've not pounded through measuring as hard as the pros that have left reviews about bendy handles.
in my careful use, the handles arent bent and they have an easy thick grip that is comfortable.
I imagine if you are an individual with arthritis or other disablility in gripping thin handles, these would be very excellent measuring cups.
Balance didnt seem to be affected when sitting onthe counter.
I love having stainless steel kitchen gadgets since they tend to last longer than plastic.
These cups are heavy duty and I haven't had any problem with them tipping over.
These are dishwasher safe but I wonder how long they will last due to the rubber handles.
If you want these to last a really long time, they can't go into the dishwasher.
Some reviewers complained about the flexibility of the handles but mine are stiffer.
These have since replaced my pamper chef sliding measuring cup and the old plastic ones my husband has been holding onto for years.
First, let me say that I HATE flimsy lightweight measuring cups!  These cups are very heavy, very stable.
and I can fill them or set them on the counter without worry about them flipping over if bumped.
I bake a lot and this is very important to me.
Also, the slant at the front makes them very easy to use and to empty with either dry or wet ingredients.
If I could give them 6 stars, I would!!!!.
I am a BIG lover of OXO grip products as I suffer with arthritis in my hands, but love to bake and cook.
They are heavy because of being stainless steel.
I LOVE that I can sit it down and it will STAY there as I put whatever into them.
I've been using some 10 year old Kitchen Aid plastic cups which partially melted in my dishwasher long ago - still functional, but barely.
These cups from OXO are like all of the other OXO products I own: Quality.
I know they're just measuring cups, but they're the best I've found so far.
OXO's updated stainless-steel measuring cups are a handy kitchen essential.
Overall, they held up well and the measurements were accurate, so I can recommend them.
Note that Amazon currently sells the updated version of this set, which means the handles flex but are durable and not saggy.
In either case, the edges are sharp enough to crack the shells efficiently.
I'm not sure if OXO has changed the design or not since all the negative reviews about the handles, but I love these measuring cups.
The handles are FIRM, not flimsy, and I like the shape as they are easy to pour.
I was replacing my plastic measuring cups every year for one reason or another...but I'm looking forward to having these OXO ones around for awhile.
Going to be looking for other OXO measuring products in the future.
(2-1/2 cup measurement means dirtying two cups)* Expensive- No microwave use~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~.
Stainless steel so you'll know these will last a long time.
I really enjoy the large numerical marking so you can see at ease which one you'll need.
These are all on a keyring, which sadly in itself is not stainless steel, but plastic.
Nonetheless, the cups can easily come off with the Teflon coating on the ring.
I like to keep them on so I wont lose them.
Makes a great gift for someone just moving in somewhere.
This is a nice set of OXO Good Grips measuring cups.
The cups have an updated design, which based on the oldest reviews, was definitely needed.
The stainless steel cups are fairly heavy and are slightly slanted on the outer edge, so they will not tip over even when empty.
The handles are sturdy, non-slip, and clearly marked with each measuring size.
This is a good quality set, which I would recommend for any kitchen.
This kind of item is what it is, and is fairly easy to judge.
A set of four cups from 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, to the one full cup range.
Accurate measurement is often the cornerstone of good cooking, so having accurate volumes is good.
The cups have a non-slip silicon handle, and are clearly labled to say what size each one is.
With these you fill completely and just scrape the excess flour, salt, etc off the top and you have a full measure.
I have a plastic double ended dipper that was graduated for use with salt, sugar, and yeast for use with a breadmaker.
Dry powders are the use they are designed for mainly.
In a pinch, you can use them to melt chocolate in a pan with some heated water, this works as a crude double boiler.
Something every kitchen needs, they go well with all the other bowls and utensils in the OXO line of kitchen goods.
These are the best made measuring cups I have ever seen.
Made of a thick grade stainess steel, the set inludes 1, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 cup measures.
It has an easy to remove clip that holds the set together when not in use.
The handles have the OXO easy grip coating and have a raised stamped numeric measure.
Easy to hold and clean, this is a well made set that will hold up well through repeated dishwasher washings.Overall, fantastic quality for the price.
They come with a strong oval ring that all four cups attach to by a notch in their handles.
The handles are covered in dense plaster to prevent the conduction of heat or cold and to help grip.
Each cup is clearly labeled with its measurement and is color coded in green, blue, red, or yellow to further distinguish them.
There are no nooks or crannies so clean up is easy.
The best thing about these cups is their indestructibility.
I got these to sort of replace another set of OXO Good Grips measuring cups, because they are plastic.
There's nothing wrong with that, but stainless steel is usually better than plastic for anything.
The only thing with these stainless steel cups is that they only have four cups.
I specifically bought my plastic set because it had six cups - 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 1 cup.
These are hard to find, as you may already know.
With my plastic set the cups have a raised line in the middle so you could use that same cup for a half-measurement.
Functionally, they are easy to use because the silicone handle cover does not interfere with using a straight edge to level off your ingredients.
However, I am always plastic-conscious and looking for alternatives.
They are very sturdy and the handles are easy to grip.
First, you only get four sizes of measuring cups, and it's always nice to buy a full set all at once instead of in parts.
The plastic set that I have stacks MUCH better and saves a lot more space.
I keep my measuring cups in a drawer and cannot stack all four of these OXO measuring cups- my drawer won't shut.
I CAN do that with 4+ of my plastic ones.
If you don't mind their poor stackability and the lack of many sizes of measuring cups, I would definitely recommend these.
OXO consistently makes high-quality products at an affordable price.
I really like these measuring cups in that they are made of sturdy stainless steel and are quite thick, handles included.
There are no lips on the rims to get in the way of filling or emptying.
The rims are smooth so it's easy to scrape flat the contents when measuring.
OXO has great products and these are high quality.Very pleased with them.
I have no problems with these measuring cups.
I find the grip very comfortable and easy to grip.
They nest very nicely and the weight is not an issue.
I love metal measuring cups for one reason.
But if you need 1/3 C melted butter, you measure it into the cup and put it on a low burner.
If you don't care about making another dish dirty then  use plastic measuring cups.
I've used plastic ones and the handles generally snap.
The handles on these are nice in that they feature non-slip handles.
When scooping the pet food you don't lose your grip and spill kibble or seed all over the place.
I don't really need this feature, but it is a nice way to keep them together.
It is very solid and has a very nice feel to it.
The rubber grippers on the handles are a nice touch as well.
I love kitchen items that feel substantial, not flimsy, lightweight, or cheap.
The measurements are marked in colored plastic on the rubber handle.
At first I worried that the numbers might eventually fade from washing.
However, upon closer inspection, it appears that this is created with an underlayment that provides color all the way down.
The handle is no slip in my hand, which comes in handy.
the cups are heavier and a bit heavy duty, which is a plus if you use them a lot.
You can take them off the little clasp and separate the cups.
I just really appreciate the style and quality of these cups.
I love the solid weight of these measuring cups.
They consist of thick stainless steel, that you know will still be in great condition after 30 years of use.
The grips are comfortable as always with OXO.
They have a bit of flare that adds interest.
Like most OXO products, this measuring cup set is well designed.
They are spun stainless with black rubberized handles.
Each cup has the size imprinted in relief in the rubberized handle, and the type showing each respective cup's size is marked/printed a different color.
That says a lot about their company and their customer service.
I really do like these stainless steel measuring cups, they have very sturdy handles, and are heavy enough to know they are good quality.
The rubber covered handles are great, because they don't slip out of your hand, and they don't bend either.
However, that is not a big deal for me, the fact that they don't bend is a much appreciated feature then anything else.
I might need two parts of one substance and three parts of another.
My measurements are swiftly made by dipping the appropriate measuring cup into a bin and pulling out the part that I need.
Exactness is not always an issue in this case as I might be measuring dried herbs to mix in a potpourri.
These Calphalon cups are actually divided in half so that the top has a bigger evenly sized lip.
If I fill only the bottom part of this cup, I know that I am getting exactly half of what I need in dry measurement.
In fact these cups are actually labeled in that way.
I have an actual cup that is labeled 2/3's  and the bottom half will be labeled one third.
The OXO set only includes four cups:  a cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup.
The labeling is color coded on the rubber portion of each handle.
The cups are sturdy with strong rubber coated handles.
If OXO wanted to make this set better, they could offer a 3/4, 2/3 and 1/8 cup so that most bases are covered.
Recommended for a starter kitchen.Diana Faillace Von Behren"reneofc".
I love that these will sit on the counter without tipping whether they are empty or full.
They nest nicely and feel substantial in the hand.
I didn't really need a new set of measuring cups, but I'm glad I got these anyway.
They're nicer than any of the others I had.
The loops on each cup are designed to allow them to easily snap on and off for quick and easy use.
They poked me in the palm of my hand.
Still highly recommended especially if you bake a lot!.
They have thick, black rubber grips, and the numbers (1/3, 1/2, etc.) are inset in the plastic in different colors.
Easy to remove one cup at a time.Recommended!.
Note - they apparently have been "updated" so the handles no longer bend.
I have ZERO issues with handle bending.These measuring cups are very well built.
There are 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1 cup measurements.
Pity they didn't include a 3/4 measurement, but it's manageable.These are the sturdiest measuring cups I've ever used.
You literally could roll over them with a car and they wouldn't bend.
They are so nice that I instantly threw out all my other sets of measuring cups - you don't need them.
They are secured together with a plastic ring.
The Oxo Good Grips Measuring Cups come in four sizes: 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup, and one cup.
This engraving ensures that the sizes won't wash away after repeated washings.
The cups are stainless steel and nice and sturdy.
Like most people who use their kitchens a lot, I have been through many sets of measuring cups over the years.
I have read reviews that talk about the handles being too flimsy and bending easily.
I suppose that bending them is possible - if that is what one is trying to do.
I prefer them stacked in a drawer so I can simply reach in and grab the one I want.
Having to unhook them is something that simply does not appeal to my style in the kitchen.
They do a nice job for me and I expect they will do a more-than-satisfactory job for most other people in the kitchen.
This group of hanging measuring cups is perfect for those who are space-deficient in their kitchens.
Very useful for dry ingredients especially, but can also be easily utilized for liquids as well.
I like the grippy texture on the handles, and how easy it is to remove the cups from the ring that it comes attached to.
These newer ones are really substantial and no issues.
Overall these are nice cups--not as heavy as some, but sturdy enough for use in my kitchen.
The handles are comfortable to grasp, though this is something I don't usually consider.
This is not problem when working with solids, but I've noticed my liquids seem to spill much more easily with this edge.
Second, though comfortable to grasp, the handles would be more practical if they were slightly longer and narrower.
So these aren't bad, but for the money, I think you can find something designed a little better.
I didn't think I would get excited about measuring cups, but these are high on the measuring cup scale.
Many sets of measuring cups end up with dents from being dropped, dinged in the dishwasher, crushed in the dish pan.
These seem quite solid and I don't think that will happen.
This also means that they will sit steadily on your counter-top and not skitter away,~They look like futuristic space ships.
They have a jaunty angle to them.~A ring that won't fall apart!  Many sets of measuring cups come on rings.
Most of those rings are flimsy and in no time at all, all your cups are wandering off on their own.
You can keep the cups on it, take them off, put them back on.
It also makes it easier to distinguish between the 1/4 cup and the 1/3 cup.~Good grips on the handles.
It turns out the measuring cup I was using was inaccurate.
These are dry measuring cups that do nice butter melting over the pilot light.
Liquid measuring is usually done in a more pour-able kind of cup.~And.
they fit right in my drawer.I hope they fit in yours, too.
In general I really have liked these measuring cups.
With the updated design, I have not noticed a problem with bending handles.
I do wish that the whole cup and handle were stainless steel though as the numbers tend to rub off of the rubber.
I also am left wishing there was a 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup measuring cup.
One feature that I really like is the shape of the measuring cup.
It makes a slight spout which is great for scooping.
Stainless steel is also great for measuring hot liquids, which I always had to do separately when using my old plastic ones.
They come on a nice ring with easy on and off slits as well for easier storing.
The updated version of these OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups, Stainless Steel, Updated Design, are sturdy, reliable measuring cups.
These are reliable for all types of kitchen, and come in handy when precise measurements are the only way to go.
Without reserve, I would say that OXO is at the top of the heap in all the gadgets they make.
The measurement markings are easy to read, and according to the company, should last through the course of time.
The handles are sturdy and all signs indicate they will remain so for years to come.
Plus the fact that the handles have a soft grip, which helps as well.
They stack up well with each other, and should be no problem placing them anywhere within easy reach.
They have a ring that keeps them all together and can easily be hung if available space and conditions are met.
The ring is sturdy as well, like this whole set, it gives the feeling they are here to last.
This one is definitely a keeper! 4.5 Stars!.
These OXO measuring cups do what they are intended to do.
I noticed that some other reviewers reported problems with them tipping over, I did not have this problem at all.
They are a little heavier than most of my measuring cups, but that doesn't bother me at all.
Set of four that clip together when not in use so you don't have to hunt all over for a certain size.
I suppose it's the "Updated Design" that separates these OXO Measuring Cups from the ones reviewed more than a year ago.
All the folks noting how the handles bent on these were reviewing the older version, I'd wager, as the ones that I got are STURDY.
No real need for it if the cups just live in the pantry.
Measuring cups are a long term investment for most cooks.
We have some that are so beat-up and battered, some of plastic that have broken handles, and one thing in common---they were all el-cheapos.
Bought them when we were first married and have put up with them for years.
Probably all we could afford at the time.
Now we have this beautiful new set of OXO Good Grips measuring cups.
Could not be more pleased!  Heavy duty stainless (and I mean heavy), the wonderful OXO rubberized handles and a beautiful finish.
These will outlast both my wife and myself, I'm sure someday our wonderful daughter will be using them in her kitchen.
These are just really picky things that I look for in a product that is going to be touching foods and beverages.
Oxo isn't usually a quality product and they seemed very sturdy and you could read the size of each cup very well on the handle.
The slanted end is great for pouring ingredients.The handles feel solid.
Easy to clean, do not stain with water spots if you dry them immediately.
I have not let them drip dry, so they may not water stain by drip drying.
I just did not want to chance it.
OXO Good Grips  Stainless Steel Measuring Cups come in a set of four.
The four sizes are the standard measurements you'd find in most recipes such as  1/4 cup, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.
The cups easily stack together for storage whether for slipping into a drawer or hanging up by the included ring.
The design of this feature is very solid with durability and long term use in mind.These cups are professional looking.
They have stainless steel cup parts and the handles are rubber.
The rubber handles make it easy to grip when scooping and they comfortable on the hands.
Time will tell but it doesn't look like the markings will easy fade away over time.There's been no fear of damaging the cups.
The weight of what's inside doesn't seem to make the handles bend or the cup oddly lose shape.
Another OXO Good Grips essential kitchen tool I believe is built to last! Highest recommendations!.
I bake often and have two different sets of measuring cups - the OXO cups now make it three sets.
The other two sets I bought for color (one is orange, the other green) and price point (cheap!).
I've used a plastic Tupperware 6-piece set of measuring cups forever, and was attracted to this beautiful stainless-steel set.
the handles) and have flat bottoms, so they stand solidly on a countertop or even on a low-heat burner, like a tiny saucepan e.g.
(And they're attractive enough to serve that butter at the table, e.g.
I don't use the ring, just keep the cups stacked neatly in a cabinet.
My only wish would be to have half-fill lines marked on the interior of a couple of the cups (e.g.
I love the weight, the shape and the milling.
The lips are thin enough that digging into brown sugar is easy.
The hanging ring works ok but does not matter to me.
Being steel; oils will not form a permanent film on them like you see with plastic.
If they decide they would like to make a larger cup with graduations cut into the inner surface - I'd buy it.
The rubber/plastic padded handle has the usual OXO good feel.
If you need to measure out something HOT, I can't imagine a better cup.
I like to buy things once and be done with it.
This is one of those products that will last the years.
I have had a few plastic measuring cups snap at the handle until I found this one.
It's easy to skim the top with a pastry cutter and get a perfect measurement.
The cups look great and have a comfortable, non-slip handle.
My first thought when removing these from the packaging was how sturdy they feel.
The rubber on the handle is nice and tight and although I tried to bend the handles, I didn't have any luck.
The number imprinted on the hand is big and visible, and the cups easily pop off the included ring with a slight twist.
Also, the ring isn't attached to any of the cups so it would be possible to lose it.
The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups are a great addition to my kitchen for measuring dry ingredients.
These work great, are study, are nicely stackable, and have a clip that holds them together that is also easily removable.
Not much you can say about measuring cups.
Some reviewers complain that they can't be used to melt/heat items in the microwave, but I use my glass liquid measuring cups for that.
The shapes nest easily and the ring keeps them together in the drawer.
Space saving, good looking, hygienic, easy to use, that's OXO in a nutshell and these are great measuring cups to add to my kitchen.
Even with the iffy ring and lack of pouring channel, I have no problem giving them five stars.
This is a set of 4 stainless steel measuring cups with a plastic binding ring.
The sizes are 1 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup, and 1/4 cup.
The handle of each cup is coated with thick, solid rubber, with a notch for hanging or attaching to the binding ring.
The size of each cup is noted on the handle in large colored numbers, with a different color for each size.
The steel is heavy duty--the 4 cups together weigh in at a full 12 oz.
The top of each cup is completely flat, allowing for exact measurements with a knife.
It should be noted that these are American cups, made for the American market, so they do not show ml or other international equivalents.
The set was manufactured in China for OXO.I've never understood binding rings on measuring cups.
But, if you really think you need that ring, it's there on this set.
And you can also pull each cup off the ring individually, in any order.
They are very sturdy, and will last a lifetime, even with heavy use.
I've gone through several sets of plastic measuring cups in my day--eventually, the handles all seem to break or tear off.
And some of my metal measuring cups have developed dents from drops on the floor.
No fears about loose handles or dents with these cups--they are built to last, and they give a solid feel of quality.
This set would make a great housewarming or shower gift, as well as a good addition to any kitchen.
But not with these really good quality measuring cups.
I already had a set, and I got another one.
What can you say about measuring cups?  Well, this set is well built and seems sturdy.
The rubber grip makes it unlikely that one will slip from your hand and spill a cup of flour on your floor.
Luckily, they passed this test with flying colors.
The stainless is nice and heavy, so they feel very durable and I see these lasting a very long time.
They're easy to level off, grip, and pour, as measuring cups should be, and they're easier to clean than their plastic counterparts.
They say it's permanent but only time will tell.- Handy ring to hang the cups on and store by hanging them up.
While I realize I can get the 2/3 and 3/4 measurements, I prefer to only use one cup for various reasons.
At this rate, they've got a customer for life!.
However these stainless steel cups with a streamlined design and very comfortable handles are a new favorite kitchen tool.
But other then when I need those less common measures this is my new "go to" measuring set.
Each cup of this set from OXO is nice heavyweight stainless steel, and each stands without tipping.
These handles are pretty stout anyway; it would take a lot of effort to bend them.
I used a couple this morning to scoop whole wheat flour with no hint of strain on the handles.
The handles are clad with either rubber or silicone with the size printed in large numbers.
They are nice and heavy, but not too heavy.
They don't stain like the plastic measuring cups do.
I feel assured that these measuring cups will last for quite a while.
I only wish that OXO would add a couple of "off" measuring cups, such as 2/3 c., 1 1/2 c., etc.
like the progressive plastic measuring cups....it's so convenient!.
Normally measuring cups do not tend to be well thought out, especially in regards to ergonomics or use.
OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Measuring Cups are a nice addition to the kitchen.
They come in the standard sizes and can be left on the holding ring or pulled off for whatever cooking use is needed.
With a rubberized well labeled handle cover, they make for comfortable easy to access measuring.
Most of the things that are measured aren't that heavy.
Highly recommended and well worth getting for the kitchen.
As a long-time OXO Good Grips aficionado, these stainless steel measuring cups are a wonderful addition to my culinary collection.
The cups nest perfectly and are easily detached or reattached to their holding handle.
The size of the cups makes them easy to dunk into my flour & sugar containers.
The handles are clearly color coded with each cup's capacity and the handles themselves are easy to grip and will not slip from your fingers.
I contacted the company, emailed a picture of the rust spot, and voila, a replacement product was sent to me promptly.
I have some other measuring cups in my baking arsenal that will fit into these jars, so it was disappointing that these didn't fit.
They are durable and should last a long time.
They're easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to locate in a cluttered drawer of baking supplies.
These measuring cups are constructed of a heavy gauge stainless material that should last more than a lifetime under normal use.
The handles are not thick or stiff enough to scoop into thick food such as refrigerated butter.
Otherwise, the only other thing that could possibly deteriorate might be the rubberized sleeve on the handles.
However, The cups don't stack so well because of the thick rubberized handles.
You have to stagger the handles to get them to stack more flat.
I have a set of plastic measuring cups that stack flat because the top of the handles are equal to the top of the cup.
This is the only thing that I can say is not ideal about these stainless cups.
With stainless steel you shouldn't have to be concerned about any chemical interaction with food.
The handles are clipped onto a ring, which can be cumbersome to remove/attach.
The handles are the same thin-walled stainless steel as the stamped cup.
What the manufacturer should have done was rib the handle to reinforce it to prevent bending/flexing when scooping a harder material.
The rubber grips are a nice ergonomic touch.
I love OXO products, there is not one that did not work or was not beautifully made.
They are made from reinforced steel and have a  great rubber handle.
I've had zero problems with bending and have used them extensively on wet and dry ingredients since owning.
They wash up great in the dishwasher and are a substantial weight - not too heavy, but they don't feel cheap.
The only drawback I can see is the price; however, with everything, you get what you pay for.
They are thick and sturdy and come off of the clip ring easily.
I've only used them a few times to measure liquids and powders while cooking and baking and have had no problems.
I read some reviewers said the handles bend.
My only issue is that I wouldn't pay $20 for these when cheaper products are available, but that's your decision to make.
They readily pop off and on the ring that keeps them together, but stay on the ring until needed.
I especially like the way the sizes are written large and colorfully on the handle to quickly identify the one needed.
I don't think I will need anymore for myself, but think they would make nice wedding shower gifts.
No matter what I promise myself, I always end up using the dry measuring cups as scoops, then leveling them off with a spatula.
You'd be surprised how many handles I have bent or broken that way.
These OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups are not going to bend with any kind of ordinary use.
Their oval shape makes it easier to get them into small canisters, and they can be removed from their hanging loop and re-attached.
This may be the last set of dry measuring cups I will buy.
One of the better things about getting things from Vine is when manufacturers improve a flawed product and need reviews of the perfected version.
These Oxo measuring cups are another high quality product in the Oxo Good Grips line.
They are built to last with strong durable materials.
These will probably last your whole life and you'll be able to pass them on to your kids.
So many kitchen products just wear down and need to be replaced after a few years.
THESE  WILL LAST!This company really strives to make long-lasting quality products.
They are very comfortable in the hand (especially for those with big hands like I have).
These measuring cups are well constructed, nicely and clearly identified by size, nest nicely, and have terrific grips.
Specific Devanagari: the flat bottom let's one place them down on the counter with ingredients in them, unlike so many others with rounded bottoms.
And I am sure they will last virtually forever.
The Oxo Good Grips Stainless Steel Measuring Cups are a great basic kitchen staple.
These replace an older Oxo measuring cup set.
So far, I can't complain - they're well designed, sturdy, and do the job.
My only complaint is they are a little bulkier compared to my old measuring cups and don't fit in my kitchen drawer easily.
They are connected by a rubber ring, which, at first glance, seems to be nothing new.
It looked like there was some difference in the size of these cups from the cups from my old set.
Sure enough, the 1 cup from this set holds a little bit more than my old 1 cup.
All the others, 1/4, 1/2, 1/3, were the same.
The only difference was in the 1 cup size.
Trouble is, I have no idea which one is the right size...or even if it matters! The difference is  perhaps a tablespoon or so.
They're nice cups, so I gave it a 4-star rating.
This is a review of the new design Oxo Good grips measuring cups.
I'm guessing that is a response to complaints of the markings wearing off so we'll see.
It does have the size embossed in the bottom of the cup so it will not wear off.
None of our all-metal sets stack neatly, but they don't stick up as much and they have the size engraved so it won't go anywhere.
There is a video at the top of this Amazon page that is worth watching.
It details the changes made to these cups in 2010 and warns the reader away from any reviews written prior to that.
The sizes are clearly labeled, the cups are easily removed from and returned to the loop, and the sizes are accurate.
The only reason that I have given four instead of five stars for the product is the price.
They do look like they will last a long time too, so maybe you will decide the premium price is worth it.
At least you will be spending your money for a sturdy as well as good looking utensil.
They are a very nice heavy weight, very strong handles, gorgeous and easy to clean finish, and comfortable to hold due to the great grips.
and yet I find myself reaching for my old acrylic pyrex set over them almost every time.
two of the silliest reasons, but maybe something that would drive you crazy too.
It's a nails on the chalk board, fork across your teeth sound that I just hate.
I think I'm going to toss them separately into my kitchen utensil drawer in hopes that I grab them more often.
These measuring cups are flat-bottomed stainless, and substantial.
They're imprinted with big, bold, color-coded numbers that I can read without my reading glasses.
The handles are notched for removal from the ring.These are excellent, durable measuring cups.
The sizes (1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1 cup) are clearly printed on the handles, and the text is color-coded to quick identification.
These measuring cups are pretty solid (they are made out of Stainless Steel) and have very comfortable handles to hold.
These stainless cups are much better than pure plastic measuring cups that can warp and stretch over time.
The handles are solid, with no flex.All in all, they are easy to use and ease to clean...except the price is on the high side.
Being a skeptic, I also tested the capacity of these cups, and they are spot on with respect to their accuracy.
The only product of theirs that ever disappointed me was a cheese cutter, but I have many other OXO products and they are all great.
This measurements come on a ring with rubber soft handles.
I have another set from different brand but these are my favorites.
They are nice and deep allows for easy pouring.Nice set makes a good gift also.
They are made of much thicker gauge stainless steel so the handles don't bend.
They are quite curvy  and flare out at the top instead of  the sides being 90 degrees.
This makes them easier to fill by pouring since the sloping sides draw whatever you are filling the cup with into a wider opening.
The numbers aren't printed but actually embedded plastic so they won't rub off after frequent use.
Strong, sturdy and they seem to be a quality product that should last a long time.
In just a few short days, these have become our go-to measuring cups for dry ingredients.
Neither of these are reasons to not buy these cups.
I can easily recommend them and had I been able to give 4.5*, I would have.
This is a nice basic set of measuring cups, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.
They would be very difficult to bend in fact.
These measuring cups will in all likilhood outlast me!.
I have a litany of problems with dry measuring cups that's almost as big a the sets with missing pieces in my drawers.
They have a beautiful shape,circular but with a flared front that makes it easy to pour out measured ingredients.
The very top edge flares to make a lip.
The handles all have the size on them,  each marked with a different color.
With every other set you face a dilemma.
You can keep the ring on so the set stays together, but then you can't use them.
The ring runs through the top of these holes, but the cups won't come off on their own.
You take the cup you need, slip it off the ring, and then easily replace it after washing.
Unless you remove all four cups from the ring, this ring won't get lost.This set has the standard 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1-cup measures.
It would be even better if it had a 1/8-cup measure, but even so it's the best set of dry measures I've ever seen.
And like all OXO products, the price is great!.
First up, you want a measuring cup to be accurate.
So when the cup is sitting on a flat surface the top is at a slight angle.
These measuring cups are heavy-duty and super sturdy.
They are so much better than the cheap-o plastic ones I usually use.
I love the grippy handles, and the fact that the measurements are textured (so they won't rub off like my plastic cups with printed-on measurements).
They have a nice slanted front for scooping.Great product!.
A set of 4 stainless steel measuring cups with the accustomed OXO attention to design and manufacturing quality.
By heft, they do seem to be somewhat bottom weighted to reduce risk of tippage.
Other measuring cups we own are generally cylinder or modified cone shaped.
While they are oven (500 degrees match) and dishwasher safe, I would not use them on stovetop to melt chocolate or butter.
These OXO stainless steel measuring cups have an updated design that includes a strong, solid handle with a grip-friendly rubber-type handle covering.
The size is clearly marked on the handle.
Since the handles are quite thick these don't stack as nicely as many other measuring cups do.
It would have been nice to make the handles a bit slimmer and perhaps have included a 1/8 cup.
Easy grip handle with the amount clearly marked.
The cup has a slanted design, I find it easier for scooping/pouring.
I've always used plastic dry measuring cups, most likely because they are less expensive.
One thing that really stood out for me is how nice it is that the top of each cup is wider than the bottom.
You'd think this would make them topple over, but they didn't.
I was happy enough until the measurement stamps on them started to wear off.
I don't keep my cups in a set, but separated in case I need to other things with them or leave them in, say, coffee.
The toughest thing my set will ever have to scoop will be rice.
I can see where they could, but I don't see the point in torturing a good set of measuring cups.
That's a different design altogether.)I love them! If they sit on the counter, they don't fall over until they are filled.
I am placing these on my list of top things to have in a kitchen.
Well my last set of measuring cups bit the dust when they somewhat melted in the dishwasher.
I've been looking for a new set, taking my time for that perfect set.These OXO's seemed pretty sturdy.
They are NOT for use in a microwave nor on a low burner.
However they could be set on that warm stove for gentle melting of the measured ingredient.
The rubber handles allow for a very easy grip.
These came in 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup and 1 cup sizes.
They are a very high quality stainless steel that should be free of rust for many many years.
This set of stainless steel measuring cups with easy to grip handles is accurate, or at least its measurements match my other measuring cup sets.
The handles on the current incarnation don't bend (far from it).
If you're going to hang them that's not an issue.
But if you want to fit them into a low-depth drawer you may have problems.
If your drawer is shallow you may want to look elsewhere.
Also, only you can decide if the price/value ratio is right as compared to the alternatives.
I previously used metal and plastic measuring cups and was looking for a new set.
This set is the best of both worlds.
You get a brushed metal body with rubber covered handles.
Each cup has a brightly colored measurement indicator.
The cups all stack inside each other and attach to a large hook.
The hook is a little cumbersome, making it likely you'll knock off other cups while removing the intended cup.
I just keep them stacked on a counter.
Quality is decent compared to some of my other cups, including my previous metal cups which were prone to bent handles.
I tried bending these handles intentionally to test durability and they appear to stand up to all but the toughest abuse.
Measurements are 1/4 cup, 1/3 cup, 1/2 cup and 1 cup.
When I was little my Mom had stainless steel measuring cups.
The edges were not that easy to hold and over time gave way to tacky plastic measuring cups with easier handles.And then.
Some customers complained about handles bending.These replace a Trudeau 5-Piece Measuring-Cup Set that I bought from Amazon in 2008.
The handle on the 1 cup size cup is the one that is most likely to bend, but it seems quite sturdy and strong.
So I compared these cups against a well-marked heavy clear glass Anchor-Hocking 2-cup size measuring cup to see.
Basically, if the OXO cups are full but not so full that they are brimming, they equal the measurement markings on the Anchor-Hocking.
OXO has since fixed the problem and unless I should lose one of these cups I imagine they will last a lifetime.
As I say above, I own several OXO kitchen products and they've yet to disappoint (e.g., meat pounder, pastry brush, spoons, kitchen brush, etc.).
I've even bought some OXO kitchen products for my amateur gourmet cook daughter and she loves them.
I will probably buy her a set of these cups.Highly recommended.
These measuring cups have a nice heavy feel to them.
The handles have a rubbery coating that makes them comfy to hold and use.
The tilted shape of the bowl makes it easier to use a spatula to get sticky contents out.
I have many OXO products, and I've always been pleased.
These cups stack nicely for storage, but individual cups can easily be removed from the ring.
I like that they are made of stainless steel, yet they are not too heavy.
These will be long-term, well-used implements in my kitchen.
They are very durable and do not bend with scooping pressure.
The design for getting on and off the ring is the best I've used.
They stay on but come off easily when you want them to.
Dishwasher safe and a design that won't deteriorate.
These are the only measuring cups I want to use now.
I like the way they last.These measuring cups are no exception, AND I will add one additional piece of information.
As a result, less clutter.Nice!  See, now you can justify paying a little more for OXO.
I really love these measuring cups, they are heavy and feel substantial, not cheap.
They are easy to clean in the dishwasher too.
I think it would be hard for the elderly or someone with arthritis to get the cups on and off of this ring.
Oxo Good Grips stainless steel measuring cups are wonderful.
You can really tell that Oxo thinks about their product design, even with something as simple as a set of measuring cups.
Probably the sturdiest measuring cups I've ever owned.
The cups are made of stainless steel and have a soft plastic covered handles.
The cups are attachable from a plastic ring, so you can easily keep your cups together or separate them.
Even with wet hands, it is easy to hold on to the non-slip grip handle of the OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Measuring Cups.
These measuring cups are fast becoming my favorite set of measuring cups.
They're sturdy, nice looking and they nest well for easy storage.
As far as measuring cups go, these are sleek and modern.
The stainless steel makes for easy cleanup, the sizes are well proportioned with comfortable grip handles.
These are the best measuring cups I have EVER owned.
Made of brushed stainless steel (much like my kitchen sink!) they are ultra durable and will probably last 100 years.
The rubbery like handles are easy to hold and will never slip out of your hand.
The cups are each very clearly marked for size, right on the inner end of the handle for easy reference.
Liquids pour out of them easily, solids and powders measure easily and come out easily.
And best of all, they are dishwasher safe! They are perfect all around, in my opinion! I very strongly recommend them! :).
There are two reasons for choosing stainless steel over plastic.
Sometimes plastic will stain; mainly with tomato sauce).The handles are stamped from the same metal as the remainder of the cups.
On my previous set of measuring cups, the handle is a wire.
My wife and I both found this somewhat superfluous, as we normally just stack our measuring cups in a drawer.
The description indicates that this allows them to sit level when empty.
The numbering isn't really small, but there seems to be plenty of space where they could have made the numbers larger.
And the font choice is not very good; especially the "4" in "1/4."  It's not the quickest to interpret.
But my main concern is the the numbers are printed on the rubber handles.
I may not know for years, though, if the numbers will remain.
They've only been used a couple of times now, and have not even seen the dishwasher.
I hope they'll last.If the numbers were stamped into the metal, I'd give these five stars.
Sturdy, stylish, comfortable handles, and a good value.
Nice touch making the size markings so they can't rub off.
The smaller sizes are a little tippy because their handle is the same size/ weight as the larger measurements.
Overall, a good product and a good price.
These measuring cups are a great quality and good price, for a product that seems as though it will last a lifetime.
I own a number of OXO grip items already, including a brush, carving knife, and whisk.
All are fine quality and well worth the money.
The stainless steel is of excellent quality and the OXO grip stays easy to handle even if your hands or the utensil is wet.
The size of the serving is embedded above the cup and won't fade or be rubbed off.
They all fit onto a plastic ring, and can be easily pulled off for separate use.
There is no line at the top, or lip of any kind.
It doesn't matter with a dry measurement that much, but with liquid it's so full you would easily slosh and spill some.
It would have been nice if they had left even a 1/8th clearance at the top but they didn't.
Despite that minor annoyance, I really like these measuring cups for their looks, quality, and price, and I recommend them.
The handles have a notched hole for hanging, and they come on a small ring to demonstrate this.
First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived on time undamaged.
The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups (updated design) are a nice set of measuring cups for your everyday kitchen and baking needs.
Coming with 4 sizes, they are easy to read and engraved to match.
Oxo makes some nice kitchen gear, and these will definitely fit in with the other awesome Oxo gear in your house.
I own a few other Oxo products that have lasted for years.
If they come down 5 bucks or so, then I will update to 5 star.
This review was written by my wife, who does most of the cooking around here.
I tend to just dump stuff in and not measure it as much.
:)The measuring cups are durable, accurate, and attractive.
The material seems to be stain proof, which means these should look good for many years.
These Good Grips cups make an excellent addition to my kitchen.
The design is wonderfully thoughtful.THE GOODThey come on a ring which can be used to hang them or just keep them together.
They stack inside each other nicely, are durably built, dishwasher safe and the markings are clear, color-coded and easy-to-read.THE BADNothing I can discover so far.
OXO's new design eliminates these small problems.IN SHORTFlawless.
It's important to note that they have no fill line, which I found to be a bit odd.
You have to fill them to the brim in order to obtain an accurate measurement.
This set only contains four measures, which is fine for my kitchen, but might not be adequate for anyone engaging in more advanced culinary efforts.
This would make a nice durable and attractive gift for anyone just starting to equip their first kitchen.
Easy to stack.Recommended for someone who's looking for a measuring set that won't break if you drop them and looks good while doing it.
I love OXO products, and this is no exception.
The four measuring cups are easily joined and taken apart by sliding the opening in each cup through the hard plastic u-shaped fastener.
If they could go in the microwave, they would be perfect!.
These are the best measuring cups that I've ever owned.
I can be a bit clumsy and have knocked my plastic measuring cups over.
Talk about a mess! I don't worry about it with these.
I have them hanging on a hook in the kitchen instead of tucked away in the cabinet.
They are quite handsome and would make an impressive gift.
Since, if you cook/bake regularly and use a dishwasher for clean-up, you're likely to need a few sets, they can get expensive at $20.
This is a very sturdy little set of stainless steel measuring cups with Oxo's typical "Good Grips" design.
Another major asset is the way the cups curve out for easier (and cleaner, which for me is a big deal) pouring.
Measuring cups are pretty basic, but Oxo has made a set that does just a bit more than the rest.
Well, I've had my share of measuring cups, that's for sure.
These will hopefully stand the test of time.
They are big - round - my old ones are oval and you can sort of jam them in your cupboard.
But because these are round, they technically take up more lateral space.
Well, that's certainly not a major issue:  It's because of the sloped sides that the top part of the cups are so wide.
They clip on and off this black plastic ring, and it's not all that easy to take them off and stick them back on.
The rubber handles are nice, and the measurements are slightly raised and each cup has a different color font.
I hope that doesn't wear off over time, but if it does, the font is raised so presumably you could still tell which is which.
I admit the rubber handles don't quite feel like the normal OXO stuff I've seen before.
But I didn't find them as bendy as other reviewers mention.
I tried to bend them and yes they give a little, but with normal use I can't imagine anyone damaging these handles.
I'm a big fan of OXO kitchen utensils and tools.
I have many OXO kitchen utensils in my kitchen that are nearly 13 years old and are still looking new after years of frequent use.
I was excited when I got the opportunity to review these stainless steel Good Grips measuring cups.
I did notice with my set that the handles do seem to attract dust and small particles of baking ingredients.
I'm not thrilled about that, but it's better than having stainless steel handles that aren't as comfortable to hold.This set only has four measuring cups.
You'll get cups in the following measurements with this set: 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.
If this set had 1/8 and 3/4 cups I would have given this product five stars.
Many of the recipes I use call for ingredients of either 3/4 or 1/8 of a cup.
I'd much prefer to have to clean one cup to measure out 3/4 vs.
using two or having to scoop out the ingredients three times.
You simply pop the cup off the ring and you're good to go.Overall, I think these measuring cups are decent.
For the price I wish they had 3/4 and 1/8 cups, too.
It is a decent quality product that will see you through years of use.
I have another set of OXO measuring cups that look more like little cook pots.
The total weight of the cups is just under 12 ounces total, and these bad boys are clearly built to last.
These OXO GOOD GRIPS MEASURING CUPS are great, and I highly recommend them.
I'm pleased with these measuring cups, especially as they're heat resilient.
I love the stainless steel and sleek design, and they have worked well for my baking purposes.
I'm not a hardcore baker so I didn't have the bending issue that other reviewers mentioned.
OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups, Stainless Steel, Updated DesignOne can never have enough, quality, measuring cups -- in the Kitchen.
I don't use them as scoops and was surprised to hear about a problem with the necks bending.
I compared the calibrations with my one cup Pyrex liquid measure and there was no difference.
These cup measurers have very clear labels so that you can unmistakably read what that measurement is.
But they seem very sturdy.The handles seem a good length, not too long and not too short.
Whether or not you want a rubber grip on your measuring cups is your call! These do have them.
Some people will find that very useful for "good grips"!.
I got these to replace some cheap plastic measuring cups that I've had forever.
These are very nice looking and have wonderful rubber grip handles on them.
They snap off of the ring that holds the cups all together very easily.
I really love the heft to them and how spiffy they look in the kitchen.These do have a couple small problem.
The handles bend easily when digging into firm material (think almost solid brown sugar).
They are nice enough that I am willing to put up with the quirky handles.
So far I have found nothing negative about my new OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups.
They are easy for me to use, the covered handles are great for my clumsy fingers.
The markings on the handles are easy for me to read.
They scoop and pour well, I have had no issues with the cups tipping over.
I am very happy with the quality of the OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups.
The price may be higher than what I've paid for other measuring cups, however, the quality definitely makes it worth it.
You won't need to replace them for a very long time.
Formerly there seems to have been an issue with "bendy" handles but that is definitely not the case with these measuring cups now.
The only reason this is four stars instead of five is there is nothing particularly over-the-top impressive/innovative about them but I do like them.
Like most OXO products, these measuring cups are built as solid as a rock.
The numbers on each are etched solidly into the rubber handgrips, ensuring they won't disappear anytime soon.
Oh, and the rubber handgrips are a nice bonus.
It has to be experienced to be believed.
Second, the cups aren't perfectly round and cylindrical.
This is a great set of measuring cups made from sturdy stainless steel.
They feel wonderful in the hand, they wash up easily and the no-slip handle grips work perfectly to keep them steady in your hands.
I love the color coded measurement markings which are easily visible and don't wash off, along with them being dishwasher safe and non-flexible.
Plastic is something I try to avoid at all costs due to the industrial chemical BPA which is now in pretty much everything plastic.
Anyone who fools around in the kitchen on a daily basis will adore this product.
I have several sets  of cheap measuring cups, and wondered if I would like these.
When they came, I got my baking book and got to work.
I never feel like the plastic ones are clean until they go through the dishwasher.
The hook, unhook is easy to use and will keep them togther in the baking department.
I only  wish they had the rare 3/4cup size included.
I can't tell you how many glass measuring cups or plastic spoons I've gone through that have lost their measurement markings over time.
Some even lost them after one or two washings.
It was time to invest in better quality.Oxo Good Grips stainless steel measuring cups are certainly heavy duty and I love them.
This set includes the standard measurements making up one cup:  1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.
They look attractive, the non-slip handles with indelible markings are easy to grip, and the stainless steel provides a nice hefty weight to each scoop.
They stack and store very easily in my cupboard.I am replacing more and more kitchen utensils with Oxo Good Grips products.
So far all have been smart and long-lasting purchases.
My next buy will be the matching Good Grips measuring spoons.
OXO is noted for easy grip products which are gentle on the hands and make many tasks more enjoyable.
These Good Grips measuring cups are no exception.
Made of stainless steel the cups come in the traditional 1 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3 and 1/4 size.
The shape is a little unusual with a wider top and slimmer base but this actually makes scooping easier.
The cups are held together on a ring which can easily be removed.
This makes it easy to find at a glance the cup size you are looking for.
I cannot believe that I've spent the last ten years using a hodge-podge of measuring cups no two from the same manufacturer.
I never believed that there could be a technical advance made in the design and manufacture of measuring cups, but OXO really nailed this one.
These measuring cups are well made, with sturdy, rubber handles.
As soon as you pick these up you notice the weight.
I much prefer these to my plastic sets which are now tossed in the back of the kitchen drawer.
This is a nice set of measuring cups.
The cups are sturdy, and they have a nice brushed silver finish.
I like that they can handle various temperatures.
If I need a cup of boiling water I can pour it right from the kettle into the measuring cup.
These look nice, and I can stick them in the dishwasher for easy cleanup.
Like other OXO Good Grips products I have, these measuring cups are mde to last.These stainless steel cups are.
a solid weight and should stand up well to everyday kitchen use.
They won't melt if left a bit too near a heat source.
The handles have a coating with a rubbery feel that makes them easier to grip for people who have trouble with their hands.
In addition the measurements are color-coded so you don't have to hunt for your glasses to find the right cup.
And OXO says the measurements will not wear off over time which is a major fault with many measuring sets.
The cups angle down--they're wide at the top than the bottom.
This may make it a bit harder to eyeball half of a measurement but easier to pour the contents.
You don't have to have problems with you hands to appreciate Good Grips products.
These feel great, look nice, easy to clean and the measurements are easy to read.
These measuring cups are very sturdy and heavy duty.
As a daily cook and baker I love them.
I've used plastic measuring cups and have also had a set or two of the cheap metal ones over the years.
The plastic ones have melted or cracked, and I worried about plastic chemicals leaching into our food.
They are sleek, heavy, brushed stainless steel for a lifetime of use.
The handles are coated in a non-slip rubber that has the measurement stamped into it.
I really like this set of stainless steel measuring cups.
They are, of course, held together with the little ring pictured.
They do have a tendency to clank a bit loudly, but they are nice and smooth.
Really, that's the only complaint I have with the cups.
I love these sturdy, stainless steel measuring cups.
They are definitely not flimsy, and the rubber grips on the handle make them easy to hold on to.
The measures for each are brightly colored and easy to read.
They have lipped edges, rather than sharp edges, so accurate measuring is easy.
They also hold up well to being washed in the dishwasher (I washed them on the top rack).
Oxo paid good attention to detail here, and it paid off in a functional and high-quality product.
This is a particularly nice set--solid and heavy gauge.
The handles, which had been an issue in an earlier release due to their tendency to bend under weight, have been markedly improved.
They're now strong and reliable and they boast easy-to-read, color-coded permanent measurement markers for ease of use.
The four cups fit on a ring which keeps them all together.
The exception, and this is my only gripe, is when I need a size that isn't represented in this set.
But if those sizes meet your needs, I highly recommend these handsome, high quality measuring cups.
Having used plastic measuring cups for a long time, I had forgotten how nice metal measuring cups feel.
The handles on plastic measuring cups tend to deflect, and I have had the handles fatigue to the point of damage.
The handles on these measuring cups seem to remain rigid when scooping water, milk, sugar, and flour.These measuring cups are highly attractive.
The brushed appearance should reduce the effect of inevitable dings and scratches that tend to mar the surface of polished stainless steel measuring cups.
The non-slip handles are functional as well as decorative, and provide a nice location for color-coded cup sizes.
I am tempted to hang the measuring cups as a kitchen decoration.Cleaning these stainless steel measuring cups is a breeze.
A soft scrubbing pad and dishwashing detergent and the cups are clean.
Indeed, grease, margarine and other similar substances that can be a challenge to remove from plastic come off with ease.
These are nice measuring cups! I like them better than the cheap plastic ones (which I gave away).
Just throw them in the dishwasher when done.
These stainless steel measuring cups are fantastic!  The only thing that would make them even better were if a 3/4 cup was included.
You get 1 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup.
They are very strong which really appeals to me.
I have a larger set of plastic measuring cups which I frequently use to bake bread.
However, I am always aware of the stress I put on them when pressing a cup deeply into a bag of flour.
It feels like the handle could break off if I/m not extra careful.
Like I said earlier, the only thing that could make them even better would be to include a 3/4 measuring cup.
I have run them all through the dishwasher twice now and they came out fine.
This "OXO good grips measuring cups updated design" set, is lovely.
This set contains four stainless steel measuring cups, with a good handle to grip the cup so as not to drop it.
These measuring cups are easy to use and easy to clean.
Unless something is really wrong with measuring cups, I'm not sure how much there is to say.
These measuring cups are as easy to use as any others.
Other than that, I haven't had any troubles using them.
My current measuring cups are not nearly as sturdy as these which come with a rubberized handle.
The handles on mine bend with very little stress while the ones on this Oxo Good Grips set are very solid although a tad short.
The latter probably reflects a tradeoff in terms of storage space -so I can live with that.
Given the choices - even with Williams Sonoma's selection - I'd recommend these highly.
They also sport pleasantly textured and secure handles.
They stack-store and are easy to keep clean.
In a low-tech product like a measuring cup, that's about all you can ask.
I've only had Pyrex measuring cups and plastic ones through the years.
If my kids were still home, NOT so much.
The cups wouldn't have a chance of being re-attached to their brethern when my kids were home.
If you share your kitchen with others, this set may require some ground rules, lol!.
Wish it came with a 3/4 cup, but not that big a deal.
This product is actually better than I had anticipated.
The cups feel really sturdy and they are actually heavier than I thought they were going to be.
Each stainless steel cup has an easy to grip handle coated in rubber clearly marked with its corresponding size.
The cups are machine washable for easy cleaning and stackable for easy storage.
This set of measuring cups delivers on the typical OXO good product quality and design.
So far they've been easy to use and manage in the kitchen.
These are quite honestly the best measuring cups I have owned to date.
Unlike the others with problems having the handle bend, mine have been unaffected.
These measuring cups were nice upgrade from my old plastic ones.
They are easy to remove from the ring and put it back.
These sleek brushed stainless measuring cups are functionally styled to go beautifully with a stainless steel kitchen.
The set  includes 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and full cup.
The handles are notched so the cups can be attached/detached from the ring, so the nested set stays concisely together when stored.
These are good sturdy measuring cups with solid handles.
The short, wide handles make them easy to dip into the flour or whatever and the shape helps scoop it up.
It is easy to shake off excess and have a level cupful.
They clip together on a sturdy ring and are easy to keep track of.You can't go wrong with these.
I would call this the Cadillac set of measuring cups.
I've owned a lot of measuring cups over the years: plastic, metal, stainless, glass, but none quite as fancy as these.
The only thing they went cheap on was the ring that hooks them all together, it's plastic.
They function very well for measuring baking goods.
Dishwasher safe and no rust spots, so it's higher quality stainless.
The other thing is these cups do not "nest" as neatly as pictured unless they are hooked on the plastic ring.
I'd have loved to have received such a nice set of measuring cups.
I suspect these will last a long time since they're so well made.
Several other reviewers have noted that the handles bend and are flimsy.
I have not made the same observation, and I think OXO has updated their design and addressed this issue.
With some effort the handles can indeed be bent, but it does require (at least in my case) a conscious effort to bend them.
They look nice, they are comfortable to hold and they are definitely easy to read, but I don't mind using a straight metal handle either.
They are of good quality and OXO seems to have addressed the handle issue from the past.
They're a little pricey but you get a quality product for that price.
If you need a good set of measuring cups that will server you for many years, this is a good set to consider.
These are wonderful stainless steel measuring cups-durable without being too heavy, with an attractive brushed finish.
red) hard plastic numbers set (flush) in black, heavy rubber-coated handles.
These handles are very sturdy with no bending issues, whatsoever.
They add an element of fun and a "grown-up" feeling that wasn't the same as when they would use the cheaper plastic cups.
The apparent improvements in the OXO stainless steel cups have made these a JOY to cook with.
My Mom has an old set of OXO cups which I always use when I visit her house.
Well, a month or so ago, I bought a scale on Amazon which I love.
but it's still easier for me to use measuring cups.
These are the stuff dreams are made of (if you dream about measuring cups).
They easily come on and off the ring that keeps them together.
They are simply a pleasure to use.BUT, if you want to be an accurate baker, you probably need a scale.
According to King Arthur Flour, a cup of flour should weight 4.25 oz.
Well, I weighed a cup from these and it was 5.8 oz.
(Of course, I've never had any issues using measuring cups, even though everybody says that if you're serious you should weigh things.
Might be looked down upon at first, but the bride and groom will use them for years...and think of you fondly every time.
OXO makes some great products and I usually lean towards them over other brands.
The rubber handles are well attached...I tried to pull them off and they appear secure.
We do quite a bit of cooking and baking in our house and own many different sets of measuring cups.
I prefer stainless kitchen gadgets of any type over plastic because of their durability and lack of staining.
After seeing similar Stainless Steel measuring cup sets I knew I had to give the "OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Measuring Cups" a try.
The design is sturdy stainless steel, they're well constructed with easily readable measurements and they're dishwasher safe.
I also like that when I need to melt butter I can use them on our stovetop.
I have no complaint about these measuring cups.
They are not too heavy and feel good in the hand.
The color-coding ensures that you won't have to put your glasses on when trying to distinguish between a 1/3 and a 1/2 cup measure.
They do come on a plastic ring, and I didn't find it all that easy to detach them, so I ditched the ring.
Tidier persons might like this feature, however.I cannot really justify spending this kind of money for measuring cups.
There are two main differences with this Good Grips set of stainless steel measuring cups and others I have owned.
But, these handles are not just padded, but also wider, measuring a full inch where my other set measured less than one half inch.
This extra width makes gripping them more comfortable and more secure.Second improvement is the molded one-piece construction.
The metal handle and cup is one unit, with the rubberized handle encasing the metal.
In the past, this structural vulnerability has caused handles on my sets to break-off the bowl.
The flat bottom of the bowl rests securely so contents don't inadvertently spill as I've experienced with wobbly-bottomed sets.
The cups are dishwasher safe and the weight of the set feels reassuringly substantial - like they were built to last.
The wide flat bases are great and the rubber handles nice.
The contract of the black rubber handles and the brushes stainless steal looks great as well.
They're made of heavy stainless steel that's not going to dent or rust.
I spent some time snapping them on and off to see if they'd loosen; they didn't.
Unlike my Pyrex measuring cup set, these can't be microwaved, and they tend to tip over when placed empty on the counter.
But they're ideal for measuring out dry goods, like flour and sugar.
Hot liquids will cool much faster in a heavy metal cup than in a glass measure, too.
Perhaps they upgraded the design somewhere along the way.So: High quality, nearly indestructible, and ideal for dry measures.
A bit more expensive than most measuring cup sets, but they should outlast a lot of cheaper sets.
Measuring cups are something you don't think much about.
These measuting cups FEEL substantial in your hands.
I have a feeling they will last forever & that I would lose them before they wore out.
Every good cook needs quality implements & these are top quality.
I expect Oxo products to be well designed and built.
This measuring cup set certainly meets those standards.
Finish is excellent, a brushed stainless that looks nice.
The handles have Oxo's trademark sticky rubber grips that make holding the cups easy.
There's a clever notch in each measuring cup that snaps into a holding ring for storage or hanging.
The cups are thick stainless steel, very thick.
The 1 and 1/2 cup measuring cups are substantial enough to replace garden digging tools.
They are certainly stronger and stiffer than some trowels I've used.
Is this a good thing or are these over designed and built? Probably a bit of both.
Is it necessary to have steel two to three times thicker than standard measuring cups? Not really, but it looks cool.
Oxo good grips measuring cups - updated design.
better tasting food i know whats in it etc.
these are totally worth splurging on whether you bake sometimes or weekly.
they are a nice weight but not too heavy.
if only they had the larger than one cup and some of the odd sizes for us bakers.
i really love these cups and am very pleased with them!.
After a couple weeks of use, we generally like these measuring cups from OXO, a brand we've come to like a lot over the years.
Others have noted the handles tend to bend.
We haven't experienced that but neither have we tried to use them to scoop anything difficult - like frozen items or packed brown sugar.
Like most OXO products, these are very well made.
These measuring cups are great! I wanted a new set that wasn't plastic with markings that would rub off.
I also didn't want a set with a line to fill to instead of filling all the way and leveling off.
These are very sturdy and have nice handles; they also come easily off the ring without a fuss.
If you have a stainless steel designer kitchen there is no need to muck it up with cheap plastic measuring cups.
These OXO stainless steel measuring cups are heavy duty and look great.
I love these! Not only do they look great but they're really handy.
My four-year-old son likes to "help" out in the kitchen.
He had a hard time with my old measuring cup which is a plastic one with the graduated lines on it.
But with these, I just give him the correct cup size and tell him to fill it and he does.
Easy peasy!Also, the grippy handles are great because I am sometimes fumbled-fingered; especially when I'm trying to measure liquids.
Best yet, when all the cooking is done, these just go right into the dishwasher.Love them!.
I love the stainless steel design with the little rubber grips on the end.
They are easy to take off the ring to use them individually.
This is the only set I will be using.
I have the old set of these cups and these new ones are definitely much better.
The handle is very sturdy compared to the old set.
They are extremely solid and very heavy stainless steel.
They have a bit of a sharp edge to them.
My husband didn't like this, but I love it because it makes scraping off knives, spatulas, etc very easy.
I had to scrape out peanut butter the other day and was very grateful for the sharp edge.
There are two things I have found that I don't like about them, which is why I reduced my review to 4 stars.
I don't like the little plastic ring these are attached to.
I decided just to remove it and get rid of it.
It was awkward to twist them off and on and I just didn't see the need for it.
They sit nested nicely in my drawer, so without the ring worked better for me.
The other thing I didn't like is that it only comes as a four piece set (1/4, 1/3, 1/2, and 1 cup).
I wish it was a six piece set that included a 2/3 cup and a 3/4 cup.
This was frustrating to have to measure peanut butter out twice when I could have done it with just a 3/4 in the first place.
I do hope that over time that the measurements are still clearly visible.There are no measurements inside each cup tho.
The stainless steel wall on the measuring cups is sturdy.The clean up easily.
They set comes with the standard 4 sizes.
For me the big selling point on the OXO Good Grips is the width of the handle.
I really did a notice a difference when I held them in my hands (I have smaller hands for a guy).
I really needed new measuring cups, my kids have a bad habit of throwing stuff away and several from my old set had gone missing.
I always loved my old beat up old aluminum measuring cups and grew up using those.
The moment I touched these I knew I would love them.
They are so sturdy and do not have bendy handles like previous reviewers have stated.
I believe that they fixed that design flaw.
They're beautiful, clean up well, have nice handles, and are very sturdy and look great in my kitchen.
You can't really go wrong with OXO stuff.
Their products are of good quality and has some thoughtful design elements, even for the most mundane everyday items like a set of measuring cups.
Other reviewers said the handles bend if you are scooping hard/dense items...like packed brown sugar.
I haven't experienced too much trouble in this area.
But I do have three sets of spoons that I use for different things.
For example, my All Clad ones can be used on the stove top to melt butter.
You won't be disappointed to add them to yours.
The OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups in Stainless Steel are very good measuring cups, they are very strong and steardy.
I have no problems with the handles bending.
The handles on this set are very durable and will last a long time.
They are large and don't nest as nicely as I'd like, but it's pretty clear these things are going to last forever.
These metal measuring cups are well made, having a smooth finish and size-marked rubber handles.
I like the wider openings on the top for keeping the overspill of flour and/or sugar off my counters.
My only peeve with these is that I like cups that nest well, and these are a little tricky.
If you want them to fit in a normal shallow island drawer, you can't pile the handles on top of eachother.
You almost can, but the top handle rubs a little as you close the drawer.
I've had a lot of measuring cup sets and this is one of my favorites.
I have not had an issue with the handles bending that some of the reviews mention.
Maybe there was a defective batch?  In fact my favorite thing is that the handle and cup are one solid piece of metal.
Most of the metal measuring cups I've had have a handle that is a separate piece and attached to the cup.
Every one of them have broken off eventually - especially the 1-cup size.
I don't think that will happen with these.
They flex ever so slightly, but I have not had one bend with my use.
The handle is wider than most, which should also make it stronger.
I am not always a fan of the Oxo handles because they are so bulky and take up so much space in the drawer.
I also like how the cup is angled slightly, making it easier to scoop.
Another benefit is that it's a little bit grippier than if your oil-covered hands were trying to hold plastic or even metal.
It seems to me these are bound to make cleaning at least a little bit more difficult, not to mention pouring out the contents.
Unlike, say, a flat-screen TV, this set of measuring cups is entirely waterproof.
I know because I tossed both into my neighbor's swimming pool, recovered them, let them dry for 96 hours, and tried to operate both.
The Oxo Good Grips Measuring cups have a snap-on-or-off measuring cups with comfort grips handles.
The measuring cups are made of heavy-duty stainless steel.
I love every OXO kitchen gadget I have, and these measuring cups are no exception.
They were hard to get off, so I can't imagine doing that every time I need to measure something.
But I love the fact that the measurements are printed in raised color on the handles, a different color for each cup.
good for those of us whose eyesight isn't a hundred percent.
Sadly, I'll have to keep my plastic one.
These sturdy measuring cups are stainless steel with soft plastic grips over the metal handles.
The sizes of the cups are printed on the top of the handle in raised letters which are also color coded.
The set comes with 4 different size cups.
The sizes are 1 Cup, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4.
The cup shape is slightly tapered which facilitates using them as scoops.
All four attach to a sturdy plastic ring.
You can snap one cup at a time from the ring to easily use them individually.
The handles could also be a little longer.
It would also be nice to have intermediate size markings on the cups.Overall these seem quite good.
Much sturdier than my previous set or most sets you will find in stores.
The fact that they are stainless steel means that they are non-reactive and can be used with any type of food.
They seem to be a quality product that should last a long time.
Clearly the "updated design" corrects the problem previous reviews had mentioned about the flimsy handles.
You could probably scoop ice cream with these suckers without bending the handles.
Not only are they much easier to use this way but you only have to wash the size you used not all of them.
I love OXO Good Grips products and my kitchen is loaded with them.
When I saw these measuring cups in the Vine newsletter, I was delighted.
There are a couple of things worth noting here.
First, having measuring cups attached to a ring is fine.
The ring can be hung on a pegboard or hook (as I have on my kitchen workstation).
But the cups are a bit resistant to being removed from that ring.
I got the equivalent of a paper cut while wrestling one of them off.
A cook who is elderly (less strength) or one with arthritis might find it difficult.
Very solid and sturdy and I bet they'll outlive me.
But that means they're heavier than the usual thin metal or plastic.
Most cooks, though, are neither frail, elderly, nor arthritic.
If you're a young or middle-aged healthy cook, you won't have any problems.
The cups are color coded with slightly engraved measurements, which is quite nice, and they are dishwasher safe.
I have several sets of measuring cups in plastic and metal, and the OXO cups are of a far better quality than the others.
One thing I would like to see, if they ever update their design: little pour spouts or notches.
With dry ingredients, you don't need it, but water, oil, milk, melted butter or eggs would make less of a mess with a little spout.
These cups are heavier than most even when empty, the rubber handles are very handy and the measurements are easy to read.
These cups come on a ring and are easy to remove and replace on that ring.
I love the shape and feel of these measuring cups while using them, definitely worth getting.
I've had this product for about 2 weeks now.
Here are a couple observations: (1)The handles are somewhat short for my liking but i like the non-slip material its padded with.
(2) The handles also bend very slightly with heavier ingredients but its nothing major and doesnt seem like it will break at all.
(3) I like the large sizing numbers on the handles, easy to see and helpful.
Overall they do a good job and i dont think you would be disappointed if you bought them.
To measure or not to measure that is the question.
The heartache and the shock of discovering that you have just used 1/3 instead of 1/4, the numbers on the plastic worn.
This is a consummation, devoutly to be wished, when ere the stainless dips into the flour yay that first time.
(in the words of my Uncle, Allez Cuisine)Take no pause!  Grip the good of the Grip of Good.
My fair stainless - Nymph of kitchen tools.
I think I must have received a newer version, because I read that people were having problems with the handles bending.
Maybe this is because they used to make the handles with just rubber and they would flex.
These measuring cups have solid handles that won't bend for anything.
The cups measure and function beautifully, just what you expect from OXO brand kitchen wear.
Stainless steel is a nice addition to any kitchen, clearly labeled, and easy to handle, this is a great buy.
I absolutely love the way these feel when I use them.
I have been using these in the kitchen:OXO SoftWorks 4-Piece Plastic Measuring Cups.
I wrote OXO about the problem, they sent me another set, and I had the same problem.
I'm happy to report, though, that these color labels seem more permanent.
Washing in the dishwasher has had no noticeable effect on the labels.
In addition, the markings on this set use raised lettering.
So, even if the color were to fade away, the raised letters keep the cups readable.Other notes:1) They seem fairly accurate.
Heavy-duty metal cups, it seems likely I'm going to be handing these off to my heirs.
The rolled edge makes scooping clean and easy, and the workmanship seems excellent- the materials feel like good quality.
The rubberized handles are nicely non-slip.But that very sturdiness turns into a ding against these cups.
The Oxo's handles are the same length as my plastic measuring cups.
This is a set of basic, sturdy measuring cups.
The best part for me was that they really were easy to remove to use and clean separately.
They also stored easily in my kitchen drawer.
Now that I have them, there are several reasons these measuring cups have become an absolute essential part of my kitchen.
Despite the fact that I bake mostly by weight, these cups are getting used nearly everyday for a wide variety of tasks.
They are a bit heftier than standard measuring cups I've used and I like that.
They don't knock around quite so easy on the counter or in the drawers when stored, which I like.
Measuring cups get used and abused and having something sturdy to do the job is perfect.
As my title for the review would suggest I really do like these things.
They are sturdy, accurate, and very easy to clean.
Unlike some my plastic measuring devices, I don't worry about these breaking and the dishwasher is no issue for them.
They connect to a caribiner-style hook, and can hang in your kitchen.
They are tools.We will keep Mario's, and move Biff's measuring tools to the camping supplies.
Therefore, I hold utensils carefully, like little food-cooking-eggs.
So, I fail to see this as a problem.
These OXO measuring cups look a little strange but work well, and do not tip over easily.
Each cup does contain the the amount marked on the handle.
The handles are comfortable but a little short.
The slightly strange shape probably makes them better at preventing spills  than the traditional cylindrical shaped kind of measuring cups.
The shape is stable but  looks a bit unstable.
These are fine though I'll probably stick with my older cups which have longer handles and don't look like they are melting.
I am  revising my review to say that we are now using these all the time and they are fantastic for dealing with dry goods.
These are really well made measuring cups that, true to the branding, have good grips.
However, they are missing two things we would like to see in a measuring cup.
These are personal preference, and may not matter to many people.
The handles are sturdy, have nice rubber grips and clear labeling.3.
The cups all pour well, even though there is not a discrete spout on the rim.Cons:1.
The one cup and half cup measures do not have intermediate markings for partial measures (e.g.
1/2 and 2/3 on the one cup measure).
Many of our previous measuring sets have this handy feature that helps prevent using more measuring cups (and therefore cleaning more cups) than necessary.2.
If the issues above don't bother you, they are great.
They're very heavy, easy to clean, and sturdy.The only drawback is that, like the picture, they're metal.
I would be careful measuring anything hot into them.
These cups are everything they claim to be and more.
Easy to use, uniquely shaped, and easy to read.
I love the clip for attachment or removal from the ring.
This OXO Good Grips Measuring cup set coordinates well with my stainless steel kitchen.
The cups nestle nicely and they clean up easily and do not stain.
I can throw these in the dishwasher unlike my many sets of plastic cups.
They are easy to remove from the hook and like most OXO products, seem to be made to be durable and long lasting.
I have been baking for a long time and have used the same measuring cups for years.
I have the one cup and the 1/3 cup left,so it was time for a new set.
I removed the cups from the ring because I like them separarte when I use them, and really don't find I need them all together.
They all go in the same drawer as my measuring spoons, so I know where to find them.
The color code makes it easy to identify each cup.
I usually dip the cup in the flour or sugar and use a knife to scrape off excess.
I expect to use these measuring cups for years of good baking!Recommended.
I have always been impressed with OXO's kitchen gadgets.
The measuring cups are sleek looking with an angled lip for easy ingredient pouring.
Easily detachable from the ring for single use.
The price might turn some customers off, but these are built to last for years so they are a good investment.
I don't see them denting anytime soon.The handle grip is also a nice addition.
I would say just buy with caution, knowing what you're getting.
I've never been disappointed with an OXO product, and these measuring cups "measure up" to the usual OXO standard.
They're a sturdy stainless steel, with great grips and clear markings.
I don't know my set is different than others, but the handles on my set don't easily bend.
They're dishwasher safe, and looked just as good after going through a cycle.
I especially like the ring that holds them together.
They stay on the ring when you want them to, but are easily detachable.
That alone is worth the price of admission.
Always well constructed with a nice looking design.
I tend to always search for OXO products first before going to other brands, as I find usually they seem to last longer than average.
They're measuring cups what can you really say about them?Are they accurate?  Yes.
I can attest they have resolved that problem, these cups are very sturdy and even have a little weight to them.
Stainless steel with rubberized handles, you would really have to work at it to damage or bend these cups.
I expect that they paint will eventually fade away.
Not a huge deal, but a bit of an inconvenience.
These measuring cups arrived right when I wanted to try a recipe for double chocolate chip cookies.
They worked well for measuring flour and sugar.
I noticed that the handles were very comfortable and the stainless steel was especially sturdy.
Usually the handles on my other measuring cups eventually break but these seem like they are going to last a very long time.
The older you get the more you appreciate comfort and these deliver.
I was happy to add this to my OXO collection.~The Rebecca Review.
They are made with one SOLID ring, and the cups THEMSELVES have slot openings that allow them to be removed from the ring.
They fit nicely in your hand, like so many other OXO products.3.
They are sturdy and come out looking great form the dishwasher4.
A number of the early reviews for this product noted that the handles for the cups bent easily when scooping.
The updated model deflects only slightly under normal use and it is certainly stronger than our other stainless steel measuring cups.
I like the shape of the cups very much.
They sit nicely on the counter and pour easily.
In typical OXO fashion, the handles have plenty of rubber.
I would have preferred plain stainless because it cleans faster, though these are dishwasher safe.
The OXO Good Grips Stainless Steal Measuring Cups are surprisingly heavy and well made.
The stainless steel cups I have used in the past have been thin, cheep steel and these are definitely not.
But I found my self preferring the plastic measurement cups over these because that are so heavy and over built.
They are very sturdy however and they clean out very easily.
Heavy duty measuring cups made from stainless steel.
No worries if you drop it, it won't break like a glass cup might.
Has molded non slip rubber handles with color coded unit marked on each cup.
Comes with the most popular sizes 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.
Comes with a handy hanging ring that holds all the cups and easily remove the one you need.
Satisfaction Guarantee: If for any reason your not satisfied return for repair, replacement or refund.
I like the color numbers so very easy to read.
They snap onto a ring and surprisingly they hold together very securely even when knocked around in the drawer.
I like the colorful printed measurements on the handle.
But, I can deal with that in return for the good function and great look of these.
Another thing that my wife liked was the fact that these come united by a plastic ring that keeps them from getting separated.
You can detach the measuring cups from the ring when you need to use them.No "cons" at this time.
Very nice quality, have enough grip area for anyone to use comfortably.
We have come to expect quality construction from Oxo, and these measuring cups are no disappointment.
They are solidly constructed and have the comfortable grips that are part of all Oxo gadgets.
The quality construction means that the measuring cups are noticeably heavier than my other measuring cups.
If I have my druthers (and why did I remember that old timely word?), I'll usually pick OXO over an unknown brand.
I thought I had discovered a very minor flaw, but realized it made the cups feel very solid resting on the counter.
I was very satisfied with my 20 year old plastic measuring cups, but now they feel cheap, flimsy and prone to tipping.
These stainless steel cups are prettier than my plastic ones.
And they are heavy and substantial enough that I expect them to be very long lasting.
I saw something about the handles mentioned but that must have been fixed.
The handles look just right and these should give years of use while matching stainless steel appliances in your kitchen.
There are great looking sturdy stainless steel measuring cups.
I have used them to measure items like flour and sugar as well as various liquids.
The handles are covered in thick plastic and did not exhibit any of the "bending" problem issues that other reviewers mentioned.
I got these cups to replace plastic ones that I had been using.
These, clearly, will not stain and the number is on a comfortable and easy to grip raised rubber handle.
Certainly any food you might measure would not weigh enough to damage them.
I never keep my measuring cups on a ring, but this design is a little more accommodating than the usual key chain style ring.
However, it is a little hard to get them on and off, so I wouldn't recommend doing it too much.
I think eventually the notches may widen and they won't stay on the ring, but this really isn't a concern for me.
I love these measuring cups!  The shape is excellent for scooping dry ingredients and pouring liquids.
The rubber grips are perfect because they don't irritate your hands no matter what you are using them for.
They are excellent for sticky substances and they clean up easily.
The only flaw that I have found in the design is that the handles are a bit flimsy and can bend a bit.
You just have to be careful with them and that's something that I never had to think about with my old plastic ones.
If they make the handles harder then the product would be perfect.
These stainless steel measuring cups have permanent, bright, measurement markings that are easily to read.
The cups snap onto a ring separately, and you can remove them one at a time.
Constructed of sturdy stainless steel for easy scooping and they rest flat on the counter for optimal and accurate filling.
Really nice, sturdy measuring cups with good grips.
The brushed steel is easy to clean and classy.
I love the stainless steel cups, the rubber handles, and the construction of the set.
They're holding up well, with both powders and liquids.
These are great cups for baking, measuring, etc.
We do a lot of cooking in our home, so we've done plenty with measuring cups.
The set comes with 4 different measurement cups, sizes 1 Cup, 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4.
All four attach to a sturdy plastic ring.Sturdy and easy to clean, these are a fantastic addition to our kitchen.
While we do not own a dishwasher, these are supposedly dishwasher safe with measurement labels that will not rub off after heavy use.
Whether these numerical labels will last over time remains to be seen.
We can detach each cup in turn and put them back on without opening the ring or pulling off every measuring  cup.
The cups don't come off super easy, but that's a plus since you don't want to dislodge all the cups accidentally.
This is a set of four cups - the standard 1-cup, 1/2-cup, 1/3-cup and 1/4-cup assortment.
I have an older set of Oxo plastic measuring cups, and the numbering did wear off of the grip.
I have a lot of good grips products and overall they have been a very dependable brand for great kitchen and household items.
There are four of them, all heavy stainless steel.
Each cup hooks on to a black, rubber ring and each snaps off of the ring for single use, if desired.
The cups have rubber, non-slip handles and can be cleaned in the dishwasher.
OXO comes through with another high-end kitchen utensil.
Comfortable to use and very easy to clean.
Oxo's 'Stainless Steel Measuring Cups' are a benign, everyday type of household item that in my books falls into this lifetime quality distinction.
Measuring cups....who knew?  Throw out your old, cheapo plastic set.
The markings are easy to read because the font is large and the color-coding helps too.
The shape is very useful, an excellent alternative to the usual straight-sided measuring cups.
The price is reasonable given the high quality.
If you are looking for a versatile, top-quality set of 4 measuring cups in the standard sizes, this set is a very fine choice.
This set of measuring cups by OXO has quickly replaced all the miscellaneous sets I've acquired over the years, including my plastic Pampered Chef ones.
These are very sturdy and have a weight to them that makes scooping and scraping easier.
I hated having to wash all the measuring cups after using just one of them.They stack neatly and take seconds to wash.
They do not have any measuring lines on the side, but I've never used those anyways so I prefer them without.
This is a set of 4, in sizes 1/4, 1/3, 1/2 and 1 cup.
The only thing that would make them better is if there was a 3/4 cup measure included.
OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups are just what one would expect from OXO.
Quality materials that feel good in ones hand.
As a baker, precision is key in making any cake, pie, cookie or tort.
This set includes four dry measuring cups, and I verified their measurements against two other sets, so they are trustworthy and true in their amounts.
Another minor concern is how the plastic keeper ring that each cup snaps onto to keep the set together will hold up over time.
Still, given the price, these are a good buy.
I like that these are on a ring to be kept together, though they are fairly difficult to remove from the ring.
The handles are a nice rubber for good gripping, and the measurements are in color on the handles.
I am not sure of the durability of the colors, it could rub off depending on how often you use or wash these.
They feel good in your hand, have a nice weight so they don't tip while being filled - unlike my old plastic cups.
I don't like the noise they make when they scrape together while on the ring, it's like nails on a chalkboard.
Definitely more durable than any plastic cups I have owned.
These are heavy-duty stainless, not chintzy tin, aluminum, or whatever they make that cheap stuff out of.
The handles don't bend under pressure and that's what I like.
I just received the OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups which are awesome!  They are heavy because they are stainless steel which I really like.
The cups are hooked together but can easily be removed to use as individual cups.
The handles are soft and easy to hold in your hand.
Just be careful because the dishwasher soap can leave them looking dull.
I prefer to have the shiny stainless steel look.
I am so happy to have another OXO brand kitchen product.
Hope if you purchase this set you will be as happy with them as I am!.
Measuring cups are measuring cups; however, these are superior.
First, because of the rubber grips, the size of the cup is clearly stamped for easy reading.
Second, the cups are on a ring, but removable for easy use and storage.
Finally, the cups' design has a stable bottom, so no worrying about tipping.
These are just about the stoutest measuring cups I've ever used.
These are not lightweight, thin-wall stainless measuring cups, the material is actually pretty substantial.
The OXO rubberized grips are, as always, very easy to hold and have a really positive grip to them.
This is much more convenient than having to unclip something (that eventually broke) like my old sets required.
These are my new favorite measuring cups, and they look great too, and are now hanging on my baking rack.
These are very nice looking measuring cups - much nicer looking than plastic ones.
The measuring amount is embedded on the rubber handles so it won't rub off like with plastic.
They sit flat on the counter and detach easily from the ring.
However, I am concerned about the durability of the rubber handles.
Despite them being "dishwasher safe," if you want these measuring cups to stay pristine, it might be best to hand wash them.
However, despite these issues, I think these are nice measuring cups and a good addition to any kitchen.
They are very strong and heavy and will last for a long time.
They are stainless steel, so cleanup is super easy, just throw them in the dishwasher - no rusting or warping.
The measure very accurately and make baking very simple.
I will be using these for years to come.
These measuring cups are solid, heavy stainless steel.
The capacity of them (often such a chore to see) is printed in bold, colored letters--easy to see even without my glasses.
The handles, though a bit short in my judgment, are of a non-slippery plastic and feel good in the hand.
Thanks, Amazon!UPDATE: I was wrong about the length of the handles.
Having used them now for a month or so, I see they're just right for greater torque.Buy these! They make kitchen life much easier.
They are thick walled, and would definitely stand up to a little heat if you needed to gently heat these on the stove top.
What I liked most about these was the way they can snap off and on the ring.
You can easily pull one cup out, use it, and place it back into the ring.
This way you can keep your set together and still use them individually.
I have lots of measuring cups scattered in my kitchen because I had to take the whole ring apart to use one cup.
Then came the task of putting them back together.
With this set you can pull apart what you need and easily place it back together.
This OXO measuring cup set is very sturdy and has durable, thick handles.
It would have been nice if the handles were smaller.
The cups are also designed so that the handles can be twisted off a ring that holds them together.
These are very good quality and offer a great, solid and comfortable feel.
I have had great luck with OXO products and can certainly recommend them to others.
Considering these are an upgrade from cheap plastic measuring cups, it would be hard not to enjoy the better quality.
They do bend a bit under duress, but again, compared to plastic which bends with anything, I have no problems with making adjustments to accomodate.
Also, the steel prevents microwave use, so there's that to consider.
Nonetheless, for my needs, these represent a high quality set I won't likely be replacing.
In the ten+ years since OXO introduced this design, they have made some important updates.
The styling is excellent, as is usual with OXO products.
The one improvement that I would suggest is some sort of measuring marks on the interior of the cups.
Having owned the original set of these OXO Stainless measuring cups, the biggest fault were the thin handles.
Well apparently OXO actually listens to their customers' suggestions because these newer models have much more sturdy handles.
I haven't been able to bend one yet.
Another improvement is the lip - the lips on the older models were straight cut and had a very sharp angled grind on them.
The new cups, while not rolled anything that extreme, have a slight outward lip which makes their edge much less extreme.
The cups are also graduated instead of at a straight 90 degree angle.
A subtle improvement, but a nice one.Otherwise everything else is pretty much the same.
The handles retain their "gripy" nature, the measurements written in color on the handle.
I look forward to using these for decades to come, just like their siblings.
I really appreciate the large, covered handles that identify the size and make using them easier and more comfortable.
Another nice feature is the slightly elongated shape of the cup to aid in scooping and pouring/emptying of the contents.
They are easily removed from the ring that keeps the set together and nest quite nicely to store.
I've had no problem with them bending when I've used them.
It's all too easy to settle for working with sub-par equipment.
First, there's nothing like stainless steel in the kitchen.
Now I don't feel like years' worth of.
is soaked into plastic and flavoring whatever I'm currently measuring.The design of these measuring cups is both practical and pleasing.
The "Good Grips" part of the product name refers to the comfortable and graspable rubber grips on the measuring cup handles.
The capacity of each cup is clearly and permanently marked in a bright color.
Measuring cups can be loosened from the connecting ring individually.
And the slightly rounded interior of the cups means there are no corners for food to get stuck in.
Why did it take me so long to make this simple switch?.
I have the OXO all-plastic measuring set, and it's pretty much the most used product in my kitchen.
So I was eager to get this stainless steel version to try!  And mostly, it didn't disappoint.
It just looks great, as most OXO prodcuts do.
This is because there are 6 sizes of them, and only 4 of the steel ones.
I actually do find myself using the 2/3 and 3/4 cups a lot, which are not included here.
Also, these do not have inner marking of intermediary sizes.
The steel ones don't, although I could still guess pretty well.
I guess it comes down to if you like very well made solid kitchen tools.
These are that, they look great and they measure fine.
But they aren't quite as user friendly as the less high level ones!.
Girls go for a guy who has stainless steel measuring cups.
And I feel like more of a man as well.
These are far superior to the cheap plastic ones I had picked up at the grocery store.
Plus each individual measuring cup comes undone easily, and hooks back on just as easily.
If you're looking for a classy addition to your kitchen, you can't go wrong with these OXO Good Grips Measuring Cups.
Each cup has a brightly colored measurement indicator on the rubberized handle and they are made of weighty stainless steel.
They can be snapped off of their ring and set on a counter easily due to the flat bottom of its design.
Another nice OXO product to add to the rest of the collection.
Also check out theOXO Good Grips Y Peelerfor another good offering of theirs.
These Oxo Good Grips measuring cups are a typical, good quality Oxo product.
They are made of sturdy stainless steel and have ergonomic rubber grips on the handles that are so typical of other Oxo products.
They are easy to remove and replace on the ring.
I've not had problems with bending of the handles, but then I tend not to abuse my cooking utensils.
I'm confident these measuring cups will hold up well over time with reasonable care and usage.
But they are a quality product, and you get what you pay for.
Like a piece of really good cookware, each of the wonderful measuring cups is made of a heavy stainless steel with solid construction.
The cups are heavy enough to sit without tipping over when you are filling them with ingredients.
Each cup has a durable, permanent and sturdy non-slip, easy-grip handle, and each handle has a permanent color-coded marker indicating the size of the cup.
I am not suggesting this to everyone, and you should always take precautions when working over heat, but it worked for me.
These are also dishwasher safe, and they look to me like they will last a lifetime.
This set of 4 measuring cups by OXO are of course high quality.
The are stainless steel with comfortable soft grips.
Each cup easily snaps on and off the included ring which keeps them neat and organized.
No doubt they'll last forever, and it's nice that they sit well on the counter but they are much heavier than others I have.
For quality and sturdiness I'd give them 5 stars, but due to the weight I had to deduct one.
Sturdy is the first word to describe Oxo's Good Grips set of measuring cups.
Oxo's measuring cups have soft grip handles which make them easy to grip and use.
The end of each cup has a curved notch to allow the cups to snap onto the ring, or to hang.
These are solid well constructed stainless steel measuring cups.
Of course they are accurate, but they are also comfortable to use.
Their rubber grips make them good to use when measuring wet ingredients, or when you hands are wet.
They also have a detectable plastic ring that can keep your cups together, or you can take them off and have them loose.
I have them attached to pegs on the inside of my cupboard so I don't need the ring, but it is handy to have.
We've purchased a couple other measuring cups sets on amazon, and these are by far the nicest.
The metal seems heavy duty, the black soft rubber handles have a nice feel, and the sizes are molded (not just printed) into the handles.
Also the color-coded size imprints help me quickly find the right cup at a glance.
They slip on and off the hard plastic ring with ease.Yes, it is possible to bend the handles if you really try.
plastic cups such asTrudeau 5-Piece Measuring-Cup SetorProgressive GT-3520 International 19-Piece Measuring Cup and Spoon Set; but if you want something cheaper try the Trudeau.
The grippy handles make them a joy to use without having to worry about narrow handles slipping out of your hand.
The quality far exceeds many similar items on the market.
With little care, they will last for years to come.
These stainless steel cups with the rubberized grips are fantastic.
What my wife commented on was the fact that there is no 2/3rds cup.
All the plastic cups we've owned always had 2/3rds.
I guess they feel you can just use the 1/3rd cup twice.
Makes sense.Over all, you won't be disappointed with this set.
However, because of the rubberized finger grips, they don't sit well within each other.
I find this cumbersome so I separated them and prefer to use each measuring cup individually.
When they are connected together, it's very cumbersome to remove one and put it back as well.
As usual OXO has a good, high quality kitchen tool here.
These cups are stainless steel and somewhat heavy, so they are definitely heavier duty and will stand up over time during your kitchen adventures.
That being said, it is still a plastic ring, so I'm expecting it to break at some point down the road.
These are so easy to read and use, and the shape is ergonomic and lets us scoop with ease.
These are great and I highly recommend them.
As it turns out, not every measuring cup is created equal.
Yes, they may all scoop out the same amount of flour, but not every kind will be this dishwasher-friendly, this sturdy, this long-lasting--or sexy.
Yes, I admit it, I find these measuring cups sexy.Seriously though, these guys have a heavy-duty weight to them that is very high-end.
The glossy stainless steel is attractive and prevents sticking.
The handles are a firm, with solid rubber with the measuring amount clearly written in bright numbers.
They're all kept together via a plastic ring that easily hooks and unhooks for storage convenience.
I very rarely EVER begin reviewing any product with 5 stars but this begs for it, deserves it, EARNS it.
I really need a full & complete set.
And the sizing is CLEAR on these and seems as if it will last.
I have the the older set form Christmas 2001.
It had horribly flimsy handles and soon lost the clear sizing info that rubbed off within a year or so.
I will happily take that slight "problem" given the extreme quality & durable feel of this newer set.
I suspect & would bet that this set will easily outlive me.
These are a nice set of measuring cups.
The rubber grips come in handy when my hands are wet and generally make them comfortable.
I expect these will end up lasting for generations if the coating on the end of the cups lasts.
These are good quality, heavy duty measuring cups with the tops wider than the bottom.
I feel that the slant/taper makes it easier to use these as scoops.
The rubber on the handles make it easy to grip and are comfortable, but it does add bulk when storing in the drawer.
Not a problem if you are careful and don't forget it is on the stove.
You get 4 sizes:  1 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3, and 1/4.
It would be nice if there were more sizes and/or these had intermediate markings on the inside of these cups.
As it is, these are very sturdy, easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store, functional and beautiful measuring cups.
Plastic measuring cups are no longer an option for me after transitioning to stainless steel ones.
I purchased these along with the spoon set and whatever problems their were are now gone.
Measurement size is imbedded in the plastic, so no smearing, and now wearing off.
Also found the cups to be very sturdy and no longer flimsy like the previous generation seemed to be.
I tend to gravitate toward OXO products, as I have rarely ever had problems with any of them, and these cups are another success.
With most measuring cup and spoon sets, I immediately throw out the ring because it simply does not work well.
This is the first time I'll be keeping the loop holder.
I really like these cups and anticipate using them for many years to come.
Product strengthsDo they work?  Yes, they measure accurately.
I did not experience the tipping some others spoke of.
I like how easily I can read the cup size (on the handle) when I can't find my reading glasses.
These grips are a bit &#34;rougher&#34; in look and feel.
The stainless steel cups are not as smoothly turned as other stainless steel small bowls and cups I have.
These have a rough surface due to the excessive &#34;turn&#34; marks and grooves in the metal.
I give them 2 stars for aesthetics and 5 stars for function.
Measuring cups don't need to be magical or fancy.
They just need to work, be strong and be durable.
Looking at older reviews for this item, it appears OXO was in fact listening and strengthened the handles so the do not flex anymore.
Cooking is more enjoyable when even the simplest kitchen implements are of the highest quality.
They are attractive enough that you just might want to keep them on display.
My husband has DESTROYED about 4 different sets of measuring cups in the past 3 years.
him + those other cups + flour or sugar = BROKEN!!! These are a christmas gift and I fully inspected them upon their arrival.
These are very heavy, one piece, and the handles get wider as they transition to the cup.
If he breaks or bends these he won't be allowed in the kitchen anymore!!! LOL.
Will they measure better than the $1.99 version you can get at the grocery store?  No.
I have broken the handles off of plastic measuring cups, and I have bent the handles on many stainless steel verions.
I havent managed to break or bend this set though.These are great, durable, and look good.
I wasn't expecting these to be as good as they are.
Get these, they will last you a long time.
I never thought I'd wax poetic over a measuring cup but these even FEEL like quality.The material is heavy stainless steel.
The cup/handles are molded in one piece and the handles are covered in a soft non-slip material.
The numbers are molded and embedded in the handle so they will never wear off.
The OXO cups are stainless steel, and sturdy.
My old measuring cups not only had the standard measures (Cup,  Cup, etc.
) but also included millimeter lines for volume.
I make a lot of sauces and homemade jams and mustards and relied on the millimeter lines to get my measurements precise.
They are a great big solid scoop, and if scooping is all you are doing they might work for you.
I have owned many OXO products over the years.
They are always very reasonably priced and are well made of quality materials as is this set.
The stainless steel is of a heavy gauge and is carefully finished - the plastic handles are fully bonded.
I am a fan of Oxo products, but not just for comfort.
There is often a functional improvement involved in Oxo products that makes them worthwhile.
The large handle is just right for me.
My set of kitchen utensils were getting old and ugly looking.
I am so glad I pitched them and ordered this set.
each piece is heavy, think and so far very durable.
So far they are holding up to the challenge of working in the kitchen.
It's a good size, but not too big.
I bought this for lasagna and serving from casserole dishes.
Will also work great for cooking on a non-stick pan.
But once you find the room, they really are a pleasure to work with.
You can tell that they're well made, and they are quite comfortable to hold and work with.
I use this more stirring soups and sauces.
It is great and easy to clean (just toss it in the dishwasher).
OXO is also nice enough, yet simple, so you can use it as serveware for a casual dinner with friends.
The quality was exactly what I expected, though I have had a little melting with one spatula.
I think I might have left it leaning on a hot pan though, so no marks off for that.
My tool set looks good on my kitchen counter and it serves it s purpose.
These items are all made of good quality.
love OXO stuff and this utensils are great!! i own cuisinart, calphalon, and others.
these guys are very durable and do not bend when you are trying to stir something thick like my other ones do.
just before not to let it rest on the hot metal portions too long (it is still make of plastic and will melt).
Nice set of tools sturdy enough but yet light weight.
I use them all the time and clean up easily you need to get you a set.
Can't be much help on these other than they a nice size; part of a wedding basket I made up for a friend.
I have many other Oxo good grips products that have all held up pretty well, so I expect this one to be the same.
This spoon looks and feels pretty sturdy, so I shouldn't be disappointed.
I was surprised how big these items are, but quickly found that they work well and am very happy with the size.
They are well made, sturdy and feel good in the hand.
I expect these will outlast a lot of other items in my kitchen.
Both of them are fantastic, easily my favorites of the bunch.
Worth the price of admission alone!I think that says it all.
This would've been a bargain at twice the price, but the great value I got on it only seals the deal.
never used it for lasagna, but it's big enough to pick up two fried eggs at once, which is very convenient.
I like it, though it may be long and large for some people.
We have used it now several times and it does just what we want; moves spaghetti from the serving bowl to the individual dinner plates.
It feels good and secure in the hand and provides a good size serving in a single scoop.
It does what we wanted it for and are very pleased with the quality.
I love OXO products since they're nearly always ergonomically sound, comfortable to use, well-designed, and a good value.
It seems like a simple thing, but a good slotted spoon makes life easier, draining the water from vegetables like a pro.
You use tongs, a silicone spatula or wooden spoon (which is far thicker).I purchased this specifically because I needed something for my non-stick pots.
They are large but easily work with all my non-stick frying pans.
I needed a spoon with slots or holes for lifting vegetables, etc., out of water in non-stick pots.
I checked out the selection at the local WalMart and the ones they had either struck me as being overpriced (even for WalMart) or flimsy.
Plus, it's easy to wash, and unlike my stainless spoon, which has wood grips, this nylon spoon can be left sitting in a wet sink.
Based on my positive experiences with Oxo kitchen products, I'll look to them first next time I need a new kitchen gadget.
My collection of hard-anodized nonstick and glass-ceramic cookware keeps growing along with the need for the right kitchen tools.
This OXO Good Grips set delivers the goods.
The heat-resistant nylon pampers Circulon and prevents metal marks on CorningWare and Visions cookware.
Order theOXO Good Grips Nylon Ladleat the same time and you'll get everything with FREE Super Saver Shipping.
No spatula except an all steel one should be left in the oven or in a hot pan.
Even in that case I can't see leaving it in there since it would just get too hot to handle.
I use the spatula, then take the spatula out whenever I am done using it so I've never had a problem with melting.
Any other nylon spatula which would do the same thing if exposed to high heat for a long time.
I got this to use in pans I don't want scratched.
But it is way bigger than my OXO stainless lasagna turner.
It is one solid piece so you don't have to worry about it falling apart.
First off these utensils are HUGE, these aren't your average spatulas/spoons.
They are very sturdy and have held up well so far.
It has everything you could need for cooking with non stick cookware.
These tools are really great quality!  I have used them and have never had a nicer feeling tool in my hand while cooking.
They are well worth the money!  I would buy them again for a gift and would recommend them to anyone!.
If you want to serve a perfect dish of spaghetti or noodles, I highly recommend this kitchen tool.
It will keep the pasta untangled and aids greatly in transferring the pasta from pot to serving dish.
The pasta won't break, meaning the pasta stays attractive.
This is absolutely one of my favorite kitchen gadgets!.
I searched Amazon products and found this great spoon.
I ordered it, it arrived promptly and I love it.
I was unable to find it the stores so I ordered it through Amazon.
Its nice heavy weight great to cook with and you can tell it will last forever.
This spoon is the favorite one on my utensil rack.
It's sturdy, easy to hold, and the handle's long enough I don't have to get too close to the boiling pot when I use it.
If it did, it would be five stars.
We have not been disappointed with any of the OXO Good Grips items we have purchased.
The grip is perfect for stable working with foods of all kinds.
We will buy from this company again (if the ones we got ever wear out).
Solid products and a good buy compared to the cheap ones also on the market for non-stick cookware.
I literally have like all of their kitchen tools.
Super sturdy, and things don't stick to them like they do other kitchen tool brands.
Also I love that they don't melt away,  Nice quality and don't bend when you are turning something heavy.
Perfect, specially since I spend 70% of my time cooking my life away.
It has a nice long handle with a comfortable rubber grip.
The spatula has a broad surface, the better to flip things that might otherwise fall apart.
It doesn't scratch my non-stick cookware and doesn't melt at high temperatures.
My other spatulas just don't compare.___________________UPDATE 4/20/14:  I still have this spatula.
I live alone and tend to avoid any complications in food prep and cleanup.
I make lots of soup in the microwave using large 2 qt pyrex measuring cups or on the stove using non-stick pots.
I have several spatulas and spoons for cooking but I prefer a spoon of no scratch materials.
This spoon is large enough for a good sized pot of soup, pasta, rice, potatoes or grits.
The recipient was delighted with this tool (along with some others) as she serves spaghetti often.
the item arrived quickly and was well packaged.
The item appears very sturdy and i expect it will last a long time.
The shaft never bends under a heavy load.
I purchased the "Oxo Good Grips Nylon Slotted Spoon" from Amazon recently and we could not cook without it.
Oxo makes the most comfortable handles of any kitchen tool company.
Even if you don't have arthritis this will be easier to use and does not slip wet or dry.
After six months use, I'd recommend it highly.
Weve been using these for over a year and they are great! Hold up well to every day cooking use.
When my spoon holder is dirty, I generally lay the spoon or spatula across the pan.
Cheaper products tend to get flimsy from the heat, and become difficult to work with.
These tolerate the heat well and continue to work as they are supposed to.
Not much to review - it's a cooking/serving spoon.
However, in my opinion, it's too tall for every day use.
Therefore, I only use for my "big pots".
These works well, but the handles are so big, you could use two hands.
Perfect if you wish to accessorize your cauldron.
This is exactly what I was looking for.
But this one does the job very nicely.
I had been looking for plastic fork for quite some time.
They used to come as part of a set for teflon coated pots/pans.
I finally came across the OXO fork, the product is hefty, and does the job.
When a tool works the way it is supposed to, you have to give it a good rating, at least nowadays.
This does the trick for what I needed.
This fork is great for working with non-stick pans.
I would recommend it to my family and friends.
This fork is just prefect for all kinds of kitchen jobs.
Plus it easy to clean, no nooks or cranies.
I'm a fan of OXO products and this ladle didn't disappoint.
I've used it for everything from punch to chili without issue.
Cleans up well and the grip is great.
Can't get too excited about a ladle, but this one fits the bill and looks stylish to boot!.
These works well, but the handles are so big, you could use two hands.
Not very expensive and fits well in my kitchen with the rest of the Oxo products I have.
I got this ladle primarily for soups and it does what it's supposed to do.
It's slightly larger than the ladle it replaced and needs to be stored in a utensil crock.
I like that it's black, as its not susceptible to staining like my old white one was.
I like the fact that this ladle is long and sturdy.
Most of the ladle these days are significantly shorter and flimzy.
Only downside is that it's hard to fit into a drawer.
I purchased the "Oxo Good Grips Nylon Ladle" from Amazon and we love it.
Great for serving soups and I can't say it enough, Oxo makes the very best most comfortable handles of any kitchen tool company.
Even if you don't have arthritis this will be easier to use and does not slip wet or dry.
This ladle is just the right size for dipping soups, stews, etc.
It is ergonomic and I would recommend it to family and friends.
Works OK with my medium-size wok, but I have to be careful not to push food over the side.
I have another Good Grips turner that I like better.
Finally, a quality turner/spatula for use in non-stick woks.
I would give it four stars if the handle were a bit stiffer.
I love OXO products for their quality and design, but an asian turner is something I will stick with in steel.
I have both this nylon turner and the OXO steel stainless steel asian turner.
To each's own but i do reccommend a stainless wok and a stainless metal turner.
The reason I purchased this was because I have a non-stick Wok.
They work very good and clean up is awesome.
I just purchased another so I have 2 on hand.
I purchased the "Oxon Good Grips Nylon Asian Turner" and a few more Oxon tools.
I like them better than the all metal ones and if you are using non-stick surfaces or cast iron this is perfect.
It does MELT if left in a HOT iron Skillet.
Mine suffered a small melt at contact point on Iron Skillet, but still funcitions great.
I love to make home style mashed potatoes using red potatoes and leaving the skin on.
The only complaint here that is of concern is cleaning.
I really haven't had any problems cleaning it.
Perhaps with a dishwasher it is more difficult.
It is easy to use even for my mom who has touch of arthritis in her hands.
Must have for all non stick pans...Why compromise and get scratches when this is as good as a metal one.
Teflon/Nonstick Cookware coatings scare me, and I wanted to make mashed potatoes, but was afraid to use my metal masher in my nice nonstick cookware.
I have purchased more Nylon products to protect my nonstick cookware and my health.
We bought this to replace a cheaper pie server and was very pleased with the build quality and design Oxo put into this.
No issues washing it and it just feels secure when serving pie.
The ribbed side of this piece really does come into handy as well.
Be careful with it though as it is sharp.
I have already used, and dishwasher washed this pie server a number of times.
It is well made, and I like the rubberized handle grip.
This is not the most beautiful pie server ever made, but it is perhaps one of the most functional.
Very well designed and made, and comfortable to hold.
It is totally practical, and I recommend it.
I love all of Oxo's Soft Grips products.
The handles are a good size and they seem to have taken left handed people into consideration when designing their product.
What more can I say about a pie server?!? It serves cake well, too.
I chose this rating for the help in the kitchen that this kitchen pie server by OXO delivers.
my pie is sliced thinly easily with this tool.
Great pie server with cerrated side - very sturdy, washes in dishwasher with no problems.
I ordered this pie server to use in serving cream pies.
I also use it for Pommes Anna, etc.
have used this pie server for many pies, cakes, cookies; but works best for pies; love the grips handle on all oxo tools.
I was surprised at how thin the metal was on this.
But upon using, I realized the flexible spring steel is actually a key part of this pie server's functionality.
It is firm vertically for cutting, but flexible laterally when scooping into the pie.
It's nothing beautiful but works like a charm.
Great to have a pie server and cutter all in one instrument.
Yes, I highly recommend this product to others.
Whenever I am in need of a kitchen utensil, I usually look at the OXO brand first.
The very first time I used it I noted lots of flexibility at the point where the handle meets the spade.
I wondered how long it would last.Three years turns out to be the answer.
I was mid-way cutting up a cheesecake for serving when it snapped.When I searched for a replacement, I found OXO now offers two models.
Since I'd already tried the other, I chose this one as it's replacement.
Be careful with the edges as they are very  sharp and will cut easily.
Cuts on both sides, (great for lefties like me) and you can saw cake with it, too, if necessary.
Can't really think of any cons, so far.
I wanted a pie server that could also be used to cut the pie.
I use this pie server for pies, cakes, and even to serve pizza's.
it is of good quality, strong but thin, comfortable to hold, and used for generous portions.
It is a wonderful, affordable addition to my kitchen that makes serving such time consuming desserts a graceful treat.
I bought this to help me because my fingers don't grasp as well as they used to.
I actually used this for lasagna and it cut through it easily and was easy to serve.
I also used it for cake but we haven't tried it with pie yet.
Unless, like us, you try to serve it with a regular knife and then have to scrape the leftovers onto your plate.
OXO tools are well built and easy to use and this server is no exception.
Replaced two (2) &#34;cheap&#34; pie servers, which I have had for the last ten (10) years.
Glad to say pie wasn't all over the place.
I really like this, but it's a little expensive.
Couldn't find a pie scoop in any stores around here, so had to buy it here.
Small enough and good-looking enough to leave on the table with other silvers.
Have been using for many months now, and no problem faced.
Pretty good value, and very good quality at this price.
First, it's slightly shorter and wider than most pie servers and it held a piece of pie better than the longer, thin servers.
The serrated edge is subtle but so effective going through pie and quiche crusts.
I needed a thin, slender spatula and this one fit the bill.
No complaints and I would recommend this product to others.
sleek is what you can describe this kitchen utensil as.
the grip is great, the size is perfect for flipping pancakes, eggs, and fish...the size is great  so that foods dont tear while being flipped.
i think its an important utensil to keep in any kitchen.
as with all oxo products, it was well worth what i paid for it.
This serving spatula is well made, has a great feel, and a solid grip plus it even looks great.
This essential kitchen spatula makes the art of flipping delicate dishes a snap.
It is smaller than it looks in the picture.
I use it all the time and LOVE it.
Great for serving casseroles and any heavy pie or dessert.
I find myself using this more often than I thought I would!.
I love this handle design and wish I could find more kitchen items like it.
OK - I know - "its just a spatula".
But this one feels good in the hand, and it actually works for pretty much anything you need a spatula for.
We always reach for this one first for everything except a fried egg (which a more flexible spatula works better with).
I would buy this one again in a heart beat.
Oxo has quickly become one of my favorite purveyors of kitchen products.
I have never bought anything bad from them and this serving spatula is no exception.
The handle is rubber and easy on the hands..the metal is high grade..they're dishwasher safe....need I go on????.
Our favorite flipper had a wood handle and I did not want to put it in the dishwasher (supposed to be bad thing?).
When I saw this I knew I could use it in place of the old one.
It works perfect, size is good for most food.
I donated the other one and am happy to have one less thing to hand wash after dinner.
It has a rather sharp edge which makes unsticking things from the pan neat and easy.
The width is perfect for serving casserole, lasagna, cake and burgers.
Bought this because using a regular spatula to serve food like cake or lasagna is a hassle.
Didn't know serving spatula's existed but I wasn't surprised.
The only problem is getting them out of the pan.
Our spatulas are all too big, and getting them out with a butter knife only crumbled them.
This is just what she needed to get under those brownies.
It would have been easier to move into mom's place than to buy all of her stuff one item at a time.
But, this is a very good item to have.
This was purchased to replace a spatula that was probably 40 years old and had seen better days.
We have generally been happy with all OXO products.
My husband has big hands and likes everything to be big.
I've been needing a good strong cooking and serving spoon for a long time.
This has a stay cool handle, is strong and won't bend and is nice and shiney and looks like it won't corrode or stain.
It's the perfect size for stirring a pot of soup or gravy or dishing up food for serving.
The handle is long enough to use in my largest pot.
I feel the price was right and will be getting another one.
The Oxo Grips Steel Serving Spoon is very versatile & easy to use.
I love everything OXO and this serving spoon is good-looking and a different size than what I already have.
Nice stainless and I love the rubber handle.
This spoon is perfect for my arthritic hands.
It seems very well constructed and is a more sturdy piece than many others.
I got tired of flimsy plastic spoons bending under any weight.
First off I have to say that I love this spoon, even though I thought I was ordering a different design.
As others have mentioned, this is a serving spoon, and a fine one at that.
Bottom line, you can never have too many serving spoons, and this one will last forever.
I bought this specifically for my cast iron frying pan & it works really well.
I've had it forever and it's still going strong, no rust, nothing.
Works great, flipping every burger I can produce.
This turner is versatile, easy to use, and handy.
I use a shorter and stronger turner to scrape off crust in a pan.
we are very impressed by the OXO Good Grips utensils for the comfortable handles, quality construction looks and price.
Works great at getting larger food out of a baking dish and flipping food in a pan.
Great for cooks with larger hands too -- guys.
My 30-year old ECKO/Flint died from regular use; a worthy tool.
I have Flint/ECKO and OXO and Farberware and a few other brands, collected over the years.
I compare all to the sturdiness and usability of the Flint; OXO has moved up to a close second place, or better.
I wish it would have had a straight leading edge for scraping clean skillets/pans but it great for sliding under food items.
the oxo good grips stainless steel turner is an excellent buy.
the product is great for use in pans that do not have a teflon type coating.
this is a very good spatula to use with stainless steel or iron skillets.
It is sturdy and I use it everyday.
I wanted a metal spatula for use when making cookies.
This one has a great grip and feels wonderful in the hand.
The size is just right and fits in my segmented drawer very well.
This is another item recommended by America's Test Kitchen that really hits the mark!  It is JUST the right size.
I have lots of turners of various types and sizes and this is my new favorite.
This spatula is very well made and the handle grips so that it is easy to use and safe.
I use it every day and I know it will last for years to come.
I recently changed all my cookware to stainless steel and this tool adds to the joy of cooking in it! - F.
It is medium width with a good thick handled grip so you don't feel like it will slip out of your hands.
It seems put together well and still looks as good as new for us, after 20 dishwasher trips.
It is thick enough that it doesn't bend when trying to use it.
I would recommend this unless you are looking for a wider spatula, say to turn large pancakes or omelets.
WELL MADE BUT STILL NEED A SMALLER ONE.
More expensive than the plastic models but this is far superior than the cheaper ones in every way.
Just an outstanding product that no one will regret purchasing.
A wonderful addition to my kitchen and worth every single cent it cost.
Works great and has absolutely no negative features.
Buy it and you will never be sorry.
Oxo has outdone itself with this utensil and I will seek out their brand of excellent products in the future.
Outstanding in all ways and exceeds all my expectations of what a turner can be.
I can't believe I ever used a plastic turner in the past when this model was available.
A superb turner of incredible quality and superior engineering design.
Congratulations for producing a turner that offers such peace of mind and effectiveness in purpose.
I relley like this item, its just the right size.
It's strong, appears to be extremely well made, and makes me wish I'd ordered one like this long ago.
The handle is comfortable and doesn't look like it'll ever come loose, unlike the spatula this one replaces.
It has worked well and has held up to months of use.
It is a fine spatula, though:  sturdy, turns chops well, generally does the job.
It is a little longer than I expected, and the metal lacks flexibility, if that is what you are looking for.
The end is curved somewhat: if it were straight, the pan-scraping function would be improved.
Nevertheless, this will be a very useful tool.
I received this turner today and wasnt surprised about the quality because I have tons of oxo good grips kitchen utencils.
The rubber handle is easy on the hands and the steel turner is thick and durable.
This is a nice light weight Steel turner.
The grip is really nice for cooking and you can tell its a well made item.
This spatula is a solid one that works well in cooking things.
So far, I've mainly used it to turn meat when frying or sauteing food on the cooktop.
It replaced a really cheap one and my husband laughed when he saw it because it was so much more solid than the previous one.
I told him we would be passing it on to someone in our will!.
Nice look and feel to this spatula but really too big for cooking mostly in smaller size saute or frying pans.
Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years.
This is really well made and I love the handle, but it's much bigger than I thought it would be!.
Bought this to use in my cast iron pans.
This spatula works great and is a perfect size.
It works great for my morning eggs and flapjacks.
Have used weekly and dishwashed and had no issues in over a year.
Came in a timely manner, looks like it's good quality and strong!  Can't wait to start using it, stainless doesn't look like it will rust.
This spatula has a perfect design - its grip is terrific.
It makes it easy to turn pancakes etc in a pan.
Will last for years, as I do not want to buy another one anytime soon.
I was tired of buying cheap spatulas that broke at the weld after a few uses.
So far, this spatula is exactly what I expected.
It has no weld between the turner and handle to break and it doesn't bend when I press down on a hamburger.
The last stainless steel turner I had got rusty even though I washed it right away....this one doesn't! So far I'm satisfied!.
You have to love the durability of stainless steel.
Don't use it with a non-stick pan unless you want to ruin the coating.
The handle is comfortable and (so far) has not melted when left on the side of a hot pan.
OXO is such a great brand of cookware.
Everything is very nice quality and for a decent price.
Great turner for meat, fish, eggs or anything else you need.
And cleans up as if I just unwrapped it.
I love the weight and feel of this cooking tool, especially the handle.
This is a well-made turner that I look forward to using for a long time to come.
I've been slowly replacing all the junk tools in my very busy kitchen (2-3 meals a day) with new and GOOD, Hard working tools.
I Love this OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Turner.
It's great in skillets but ALSO works well on my grill.
It's a basic, hard working, strong and well-built stainless steel turner.
I am sure there must be a dozen worthy spatulas, but this is the one I picked and I am quite happy with it.
By the way, I hand wash it, never in the dishwasher.
I was looking for something larger than my little plastic one, and this one is very nice.
Unfortunately, because it is stainless steel I can't use it on my griddle because it scratches the surface of it.
Haven't used it yet but I can tell it is made very well and has a great handle.
I already threw out my old spatula because I can already tell that I am going to love this spatula!.
I recently took all of our old kitchen utensils and replaced them with OXO Grips and everyone of the OXO name items.
The insulated handles are great, and with the construction looks great.
This is just wonderful!  I have arthritis and the cushioning in the handle is perfect for me.
It's OXO...what more can i say? Grip is terrific, size of spoon is as needed, and quality is as expected.
Its impossible to buy bad stuff from oxo.
I love their rubber handled utencils...They are easy on the hands and are dishwasher safe.
The metal is thick and of real quality.
Its easy-to-clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hard-wearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years.
I bought 4 of the OXO Good Grips items for my daughter for Mothers Day and she just loved all of them.
I knew I loved all my serving and cooking pieces, I hoped she would also.
Along with all her other items, she was thrilled.
That made both of us Happy Campers alone with some celebrating with some good eats.
Once they came I was thrilled with the decision.
These will last as long as I do and through some heavy-duty casseroles and bread dough scooping.
I have been looking for a good spoon to mix potato salad, cookies, cakes, etc.
The spoon is well made and the soft grip helps prevent stress and fatigue in my hand and wrist.
Made of stainless steel, has a nice balance and strong for most home applications.
It can be fairly easily bent, so it's not really appropriate for heavy duty commercial use.
I am a huge fan of wooden spoons.
The only issue with wooden spoons is, after enough washes, the wood starts to split.
I was a little hesitant to switch to a steel spoon, but I figured oxo, it's got to be good.
Besides my favorite comfort handle, I use this spoon for pretty much everything from cooking to serving.
I know it's not the nicest spoon to serve with, but I have gotten only compliments.
The spoon is well designed and comfortable to use, & I appreciate the rubber handle.
But that same feature makes it inappropriate for company.
This slotted spoon is easy to handle with it's special grip.
It's on the heavier side, but that's good and just the way I want things to be made.
I hate it when utensils are too light and feel flimsy and like they're going to break with too much use.
This one is going to last a long time!  The handle has a great grip and is easy to hold on to.
These are the best kitchen utensils I've ever had/used plan on owning them all as soon as i can you will not be disappointed.
Love this spoon!  Nicely made...not cheaply made...handle is very comfortable and the size and shape of the spoon holds a good amount.
I test others and always revert back to oxo.
Capacity of ladle is as needed, the grip is good, and it hasn't discolored yet!.
I just love all my OXO products and this ladle didn't disappoint me.
I bought this ladle for my daughter since I liked mine so much.
I just want a ladle that will scoop a good helping.
The grip is great and the helping is perfect.
I love oxo handles! They are so comfortable to do kitchen work.
My only complaint is that the handle is a bit short for a ladle.
It tends to fall into my soup, since my soup pot is super deep.
It is standard, well built and does the job.
What else should I say to satisfy the number of words required per review?.
Every one of the stainless cookware items particularly are honestly great and the price is about the best you'll find for utensils of this quality.
I like that it has a bit of a rim to it, which keeps stuff from sliding back off into the pot.
Great for fishing deep fried foods out of the oil, cooked pasta out of the pot, and dumplings out of boiling water.
The smoothness of this skimmer also allows for very easy cleaning (unlike the wire ones where food gets stuck in the tiny twists).
THe handle is comfortable to hold and heat resistant.
Simply a great product! Another winner from OXO!.
Product is solid and performs its functions as expected.
Looked all over stores for this , but all i could find was the flimsy plastic ones.
Great skimmer...well made and handy for a variety of purposes.
Terrific for deep frying and can be used like a spider.
I love this skimmer! It works well to take out anything from a pot.
I use it a lot--especially to remove meatballs from my home made sauce.
It washes well in the dishwasher and never rusts!.
Perfect for skimming; Very useful when I am canning - just finished making apple juice and apple jelly and found this invaluable.
I so missed the broken skimmer I had for years that came with my wok, and finally ordered this one.
It is typical of OXO utensils....sturdy and well-made.
So happy to have this upgrade and know it will give me years of good use.
This skimmer is large enough to use in my deep fryer and fits well in most of my pots and pans.
I like this much better than the concentric circle design of other skimmers which don't work well with many foods.
This skimmer has wholes to let liquid go through without losing the food you are straining.
It is a good  size, comfortable handle, looks cute in your hand.
Have used it many times so far and no problems.
Does what I had expected it would do.
I didn't think I would need a skimmer.
I figured I would use a slotted spoon, but the skimmer makes it to much easier when frying.
As usual, it has my favorite oxo comfort handle.
I strained macaroni & medium shells pasta with this.
The best thing being that you can take the entire batch out of the oil in one scoop.
The 4" size is just right, not large & not small.
I love stainless steel utensils coz they are always safe.
The first thing to note when using a French press is that it's extremely important to grind the beans to the correct degree.
If they are too fine, you will end up with a cup of sludge.
It is also important to note that the longer the press sits with coffee and water in it, the stronger the drink will be.
I have a nice Bodum glass teapot but I actually prefer using my Bonjour press when I make loose tea.
It's seems to be holding up well to regular use, I'm very happy with the quality.
It was a bigger upgrade than I imagined it would be.
The filter worked great, no wasted coffee in the bottom to avoid getting a mouthful of grinds and it pressed incredibly easily and smoothly.
I also like how it seemed to class up my dorm's kitchen counter, it just plain looks fancy.
My 8 year old Bonjour finally fell apart, and I mean fell apart, the plastic plunger disc broke in three pieces [new is all metal].
When I bought this unit it was labeled 3 cups and held a little more than 3 cups.
I looked on Amazon and found a 3 cup press.
Bought it and was hugely disappointed when I opened the box.
The store was honest to place description labels next to each press identifying each as holding up to 3.5 cups, not 8 cups.
Everything is identical - even screen mesh - between the two presses except for the spiral wire around the edge top of the plunger screen.
The Bonjour wire is finer and tightly wound where the Bodum wire is thicker, wider & loosely wound.
This is the only reason I went with the Bonjour.
I knocked 1* off for the misleading advertisement.
YMMV.Note that there is a fill line on the glass.
The Aerolatte was my first attempt at a home frother.
I found that it worked erratically, but was useful enough.
A friend recommended I try the BonJour.The Caffee Froth requires no batteries, produces dependable froth, and is fun to use.
I enjoy using it, and find myself finding new uses for frothed milk.It's a very elegant device!.
Forget those $100-plus frothers that are complicated to use and clean.
The BonJour Caffe Milk Frother is perfect:  easy to use, easy to store, easy to clean, with no plastic parts on the main unit.
My advice to BonJour:  ditch the plastic spoon altogether or offer a frother with a stainless steel spoon.
The glass is not fragile, far from it.
This is a very sturdy piece of equipment and the rubber base provides extra protection for the glass while pumping the unit.
Clean up is a breeze, soon as the plunger comes out, I run it under hot water and inside of 10 seconds, I'm done.
This product works great!  It even froths 2% milk.
I've ordered a replacement carafe and a spare complete unit.
This frother is a must for the serious coffee drinker.Dec.
25, 2013:  I have just broken my 2nd, and last, glass carafe in 6 months.
Clumsy oafs are not to be trusted with thin glass.
I am ordering the HIC stainless steel frother.
Glass is rather &#34;thin&#34; so I figure you must be extremely careful or you'll break it.
Actually works better than my espresso machine's steam wand.and doesn't introduce additional water.
What I LOVE about shopping at Amazon is being able to read all the reviews before I make a decision about buying something.
And after reading all the raves about the Bonjour Caffe Froth Turbo, I bought one.
Everyone who loves it is absolutely right! It's fast, makes the greatest froth, and couldn't be easier to use or to clean.
Even if you've got a very expensive espresso maker the Bonjour Caffe Froth Turbo will be a welcome addition to your coffeemaking ritual.
This frother works great and has more power than others I have owned,go for it!.
Ok, now I ordered this on a whim.
I wondered if it were really froth I didn't like or steamed milk.
This little thing froths up the half and half I use in my coffee like nobody's business.
I think if I let it whip much longer I'd get whipped cream.
Anyhow, for frothing/blending this little gadget is GREAT - only thing I would do different is make the wand a little longer.
RECENTLY I GOT A BRAIN STORM AFTER SPENDING ALMOST $4.00 A CRACK FOR A VENTI LATTE @ THE KING OF ESPRESSO BARS,"S--------".
WHY NOT JUST USE MY STANDARD DRIP CUISINART TO MAKE SOME REALLY GOOD ESPRESSO, THEN FIND A FROTHER FOR THE MILK.
BINGO! BON JOUR! THIS BABY WORKS JUST GREAT!!!!!!!IT'S GOT THE POWER,IT'S QUICK,TAKES NO ROOM, AND IS A CINCH TO CLEAN!!!  JUST MAKE 2 C.
OF ESPRESSO,& WHILE THAT'S DRIPPING, POUR 6 OZ.
OF MILK [I USE 1%] INTO A 2 CUP GLASS PYREX MEASURE, BON JOUR IT FOR PROBABLY 15 SECS.
Secondly, it's great for emulsifying powder-based drinks, such as hot cocoa or protein shakes.
Lastly, it's compact, fits nicely in a kitchen drawer and makes a great kitchen/bar bridal shower gift.
It's the bomb! Get it, use it, wonder how you lived without it.
easy on my latex free dishwashing gloves which are not cheap.2.
a bit tricky at first, but a breeze now3.
The blade does not get gooky with dried food and require cleaning4.
as easy to crank as any other manuel.
even works on pop-top cansWhat I don't like - keep your old manual around1.
does not work on all cans, especially those really small2.
I wanted a manual can opener that would help encourage me to recylce more.As far as durability, I'll have to wait and see.
Just got it for Christmas 2009.10/2011 I still love this and it has held up very well.
The Kuhn Rikon can opener is a  durable, quality-contstructed kitchen tool that I wouldn't be without now that I've had mine for a few months.
After only a few tries, though, it became second nature.
Do what I do:  save time by pulling apart the lid from the body with your two hands instead.-Andrea, aka Merribelle.
I don't like electrics and have tried many hand models - this one is a real winner...get yourself one.
You will be SO glad you did ;~)).
It is easy to put on and take off.
Why this can opener is so good is because of how it works and the quality of the product.
This can opener you place on top of the can and it separates the top of the can from the can cylinder.
Contrary to the language used in the Amazon review, the can opener does not depend on cutting.
The Kuhn Rikon Safety Lid Lifter depends on breaking the seal between the lid and the can.The knob that you turn rotates a knurled wheel.
When pinched on a can, it is forced into contact with the inside edge of the can lid.
Once you get used to it, you automatically push down lightly on the turning knob as you close the grips.
If you can't do that, you probably don't want this can opener.
We've had one of these for years and just loved it.
It is SO much better and cleaner than the old type.
When my daughter and her husband needed one, we bought them one as well and they also really like it.
It does take a few tries to learn how to use it but after you learn, it's no problem at all.
The old type can opener gets dirty every time you open a can, and this on does not- that the best feature of all.
but i'll never go back to the standard openers.
i've had mine for 2 years and have yet to find a can it couldn't open (ok, i'll admit i haven't tried rectangular sardine cans).
another advantage is that you can re-use the top to cover the can if you are using only part of the contents.
We've had our Kuhn-Rikon opener for several years now, and we love it.
It's easy to use, leaves a clean cut in the side of the lid seal, and is today as good as new.
It's easy to position, cuts well, no sharp edges.
The problem I had was that it takes at least twice the hand force than a regular opener.
This is definitely not for people who have hand problems.
I have had, and used a great deal, this can opener for somewhere between four and five years.
Not only is it just like new still, but I still love it.
After seeing a guy on late-night TV open can after can with one of these things, I just had to try one for myself.
First, it's not that much harder to turn than a standard opener.
While I don't have arthritis, or anything like that, I've noticed no increased effort with this thing.
And, as advertised, it leaves no sharp edges, and you can put the lid back on the can for storage, which is kind of cool.
And even though I've had mine awhile now, I still find it difficult to get the opener positioned properly.
This can opener works as the packaging described.
There are no sharp edges on the opener itself or the can after it has been opened.
I was disappointed by the fact that I saw the same opener at a local store for less than what I paid on Amazon.
There's a learning curve to doing this consistently right.My previous side openers had a very short life span, even as short as a month.
In two months of use, this opener is still tight with no slop at all.
I think it will last a long long time.
This Kuhn Rikon Auto Deluxe Safety LidLifter seems well built.
It does take a little getting used to but once you've got the hang of it, it's a great product!Would recommend.
This is well built, easy to use, and is able to open cans without creating sharp edges.
I preferred the Rosle quite a bit but this one is still good.
To drop the lid, you simply turn the handle backwards a quarter turn and the lid is released into whatever receptacle is waiting below it.
If these economic times make you want to save money where you can, then this is a very good alternative for half the price.
It is easy to use and I like its metal construction.
For years I have had the Krups electric version of this type of can opener and wanted a manual.
I have seen another can opener in plastic that is almost identical to this design- I will stick to the original.
I am a fan of Kuhn Rikon products.
Having tried their pots, pans, and pressure cookers, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this item.
Once again Kuhn Rikon has developed an outstanding product.
In fact, it worked so well that I went ahead and bought their easy-to-clean garlic press as well.
With everyone recycling more and more I often worried about the sharp tuna fish can edges and the like.
Well,thanks to this can opener, I no longer have sharp edges, just smooth, beautiful edges.
The can opener doesn't even touch the food.
I have nothing bad to say about the operation of this can opener - it is perfect.
This is the can opener you need for the 21st century and beyond!.
So, now I like this product a lot more.
You can tell that you've reached where you started when it clicks and moves with much less pressure.
As mentioned previously, this can-opener opens cans through the side of the rim, not cutting through the top.
This ensures no sharp edges; though it's a bit harder to turn, (if I had arthritis, this would not be my opener of choice).
Though initially expensive, you get what you pay for in this case.
Kuhn Rikon quality and durability that has lasted me 6 years, (and still running), coupled with classic good-looks.
There is no can opener I have ever used that comes close to my Deluxe Kuhn in ergonomics/ease of use.
Perhaps it is the fact that it turns in the horizontal instead of the vertical plane that causes problems for some people.
Greatly reduces spill and overflow in opening cans.4.
Big shiny handle with red tip makes it easy to find in drawer.5.
No sharp edges on top after removal--a nice safety factor.6.
It's a no brainer to use.Better than electric in my opinion.
Cleaner, takes less space, just as easy to use.
It is so easy and safe to use.It does everything that it is advertised for  :-).I definitely recommend it to everyone.
It's easy to turn...and isn't too difficult to figure out how to use (unlike the Rosle).I love it.
This is the best hand held can opener we ever used.
This unit looks so weak and unable to handle the job, but that is just the image.
We had another, much more expensive opener that just stopped doing a good job after a year.
This was so cheap compared that I was afraid to try but went ahead with it because of reviews.
I recommend this can opener to anyone who opens more than five cans a year.
The first time I used this device I thought nothing had happened.
It is so effortless I thought it had not worked.
One time around and the top of the can is ready to be lifted off.
There are  NO SHARP EDGES & NO NEED TO DIG THE TOP OUT OF the sauce or what ever.
In fact one of the best things about this can opener is that it does not touch the content of the can.
No mess to create food deposits and stain plus no clean up of the mess.
This is a small step in the advancement of cooking chores but for me it is leap from the old super market .25 cent kind.
Why this can opener is so good is because of how it works and the quality of the product.
This can opener you place on top of the can and it separates the top of the can from the can cylinder.
Contrary to the language used in the Amazon review, the can opener does not depend on cutting.
The Kuhn Rikon Safety Lid Lifter depends on breaking the seal between the lid and the can.The knob that you turn rotates a knurled wheel.
When pinched on a can, it is forced into contact with the inside edge of the can lid.
To see this, click on other products by Kuhn Rikon.
Once you get used to it, you automatically push down lightly on the turning knob as you close the grips.
This assures that the can opener is laying flat on top of the can.The can opener is designed for use by right handed people.
If you can't do that, you probably don't want this can opener.
This can opener took a bit for me to get the hang of.
Once I did, I'll never use another can opener.
When you do get the hang of it, you won't believe how simple it really is.
This can opener is far superior to any other opener I've ever used in function and quality.
Not having sharp edges either on the can or lid is great.
Being able to remove the lid without touching it is a bonus.
Buy it,learn to use it, and you'll never go back to traditional openers.
There's a quantum improvement here in the way this can opener works.
It cuts just below the top of the top -- leaving no kind of sharp edge on either the can nor on the top.
The entire cutting part never contacts the can's contents, so, therefore, never gets cruddy, never needs to be washed or even wiped.
It seems that there is nothing to wear out, but on that score who knows? It is really super.
I can RUB my finger against it and not get cut.
I use this edge-cutting opener for all other day-to-day uses though since it's much safer and cleaner.
Don't think I will ever buy another electric can opener again.
One more thing off the counter top and this opener fits nicely in the drawer.
My old electric was a safety cut also but it died.
My only complaint it the pincher to help remove the lid could work better, it doesn't always grip the lid, somewhat of a pain.
I am hoping this will last much longer than my electric one did and when it goes I will buy another.
My son introduced this to my wife and she to me.
We will never go back to the old kind and don't like the electric ones.
We've owned several electric can openers over the years.
They're messy; the blade needs to be cleaned regularly and eventually rusts.
I don't like clutter on my countertops, so a hand-held opener that I can toss in the drawer was a perfect solution.
I bought the Kuhn Rikon Auto Deluxe based on reviews.
It's a sturdy, well-made product and the red color makes it easy to spot in the drawer.
When I bought it I thought the Lid Lifter was a silly gimmick, something I wouldn't be using.
My husband was the first to use the opener and was soon cursing it.
I tried it myself and it didn't seem to be working.
I couldn't lift the lid off and the can looked like it was still sealed.
Turns out this "silly gimmick" is a very necessary part of the design.
We've had the opener for 4 months and are very happy with it, never a problem with slivers or sharp edges.
We're seniors and both agree it's easier to use than an electric opener (even for my husband, who's a lefty).
Since it doesn't touch the contents of the can, the opener stays clean.
Though probably not necessary, I do occasionally hand wash it.
Lids left off easily and then you can put them back on to cover an open can.
And it's really sturdy and the design seems like it will hold up to years of use.
I absolutely love this thing and can't imagine why anyone would want a traditional can opener!.
I got this to compare with other one that came with can opener.
what's best opener right? this worked good too.
I ended up looking for beer bottle opener so this was for showing in front of children so they dont wonder about beer bottle.
i like the other one just out of having all the capability but this one is designed with cuter red.
The first Kuhn Rikon can opener I had didn't quite cut it anymore .I really liked and use it for a long time.
I purchased the Auto deluxe safety lid lifter and the Auto Ergo safety lid lifter since I didn't see the model I already had.
They both work well I prefer this lifter to the Ergo model.
After breaking through the handle on 3 of the plastic &quot;safety&quot; can openers, we decided to give this one a shot.
It is well constructed out of durable stainless steel.
You pay more, but it lasts longer without the frustration of watching your can opener fall apart in your hands.
Every home should have one especially if you have an emergency storage box and the power goes out...Highly recommend this can opener.
We have had it at least a month, it hasn't broken like one reviewer said hers did.
What could be easier than setting the opener on top of the can, turn the handle and the Kuhn Rikon does the rest.
We were given a Krups brand electric opener that cut the side of cans.
After 3 years of use, the gripping gears and cutter were worn to the point they no longer worked.
Unfortunately, this appliance is sealed and cannot, therefore, be serviced.
Looks brand new after nearly a years use,.
Rarely am I overly impressed with "gadgets" that I might pick up online, and I was definitely skeptical about this one.
But after going through SO many expensive and cheap can openers, I couldn't resist.
Just like the ads say, you can open a can, and put the lid back on it.
It doesn't cut the "can", but splits the seal, so the lid goes right back on and the temp in the fridge re-seals the lid.
You have to constantly clean them after every use...I left mine in the dishwasher which destroyed them after about 3 months.
But now I've been using the Kuhn Rikon for months, and it's still spotless without a single wash.
But the finish on the stainless is somehow super fingerprint resistant...as long as there's no food on my hands, the handle stays spotless.
The one I bought was the all-stainless one...and it's still spotless after years of routine use.
It still looks and works like brand new!).
It's the greatest can opener I've ever used.
It is clean, it never touches the food.
It is safe, there are no sharp edges - if used correctly.
It looks as good as a can open can look.
It takes some getting used to if you have always used traditional can openers.
We only got rid of the instructions because we moved across the country.
I love it so much that the first Christmas - 1999 - I bought one of these for every member of my family.
They thought I was crazy, but now they all love it too.
I also give it as a housewarming gift to all our friends.
I've used this can opener for the last couple of years and love it.
It does a perfect job each time.However, I remember being frustrated the first few times.
The reason was that I tried to place it on the can at the same angle that I used to place the other can openers.
One should place it on the can perpendicular to the can, and not on the sides.
You'll notice that the opener grips the can, and you can turn the knob until it goes a full round.What a great invention !!.
The older I get, the more I appreciate quality cookware.
This beautiful 7qt stainless steel pressure cooker by Kuhn Rikon is no exception to that rule.
We took a chance and ordered a repackaged one at a substantial discount.
Thus, I was a little concerned about whether we had all of the required parts.
My guess is that the assembly instruction sheet went by the wayside with the packing material.
But we figured it out, and it worked perfectly when we used it.
Once everything was chopped and thrown into the pot, the entire dish was done in 25 minutes.
Let me tell you, the brown rice that came out of this pressure cooker was almost creamy.
This was fantastic for someone like me who can't have dairy and totally misses those creamy risottos, as well as all other things dairy.
The entire dish was so delicious, and I didn't have to stand over it and stir for an hour, either.
Win!I should disclose that this was my first attempt at using a pressure cooker.
So I was really jazzed at how well this cooker worked.
It did take some experimentation with our gas stove to keep the pressure in the correct zone.
It got too high at one point, so I simply turned the stove off until the pressure went back down to the correct zone.
I wasn't sure how that would affect the cooking time (answer: it didn't).
A few swipes with a dry towel and it looked like new.
Believe me, I'm going to be scouring Amazon for any other deals on great cookware like we snagged with this one!.
So I was looking for a new PC and I was on the fence between this model and the one without the long handle.
And it is KILLER pot roast.YOU WILL WANT A FLAME-TAMER (or if you have hung around bio.
And she loves hers and is comfortable with it.
sorry I have the dry rosemary and dry it has to be for now !! So.
They want a pressure cooker !!The instruction from the recipe says to use the pressure cooker to fry meats and onions first.
Make sure the proper pressure is attained and mantained.
Expensive, but I'm developing an appreciation for this pressure cooker.
It does not look like something that would cost over $100, but it functions well and makes cooking more pleasant an experience.
Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this cooker is virtually silent and you must stay in the kitchen to keep an eye on the pressure.
Especially with an electric burner, since heat adjustments on these are not instant as they are with gas.
It doesn't take long, however, to learn how and when to make adjustments so the correct pressure is maintained.
This cooker conducts heat and disperses it evenly, making it fast and efficient.
For the final wash all four pieces (bottom, top, top "vent hat", gasket) go into the dishwasher.
hmmm I think I'll budget for another one this year.
We have several pc's, both larger and smaller.
We don't use the 12 qt Kuhn Rikon as often as we thought.
We just like this one best!We Also bought this model for our son in the military.
He is stationed in CO and with the altitude, a pressure cooker is a handy tool.
He too loves this pc and uses it all the time.
He cooks it for about 45 minutes, lets the pressure release naturally, then strains out the bones and extra veggies (throws them away).
He measures and packages the broth in one quart freezer ziplocks to use when making soup, rice or sauses.
The chicken was already divided into 8 packages and put in the freezer when he boned the chicken.
He could easily cook chicken in the pc too, but he likes the Costco rotisserie chicken.
He can get 20+ meals out of two Costco chickens.
He also likes to make spicey beans in his pc.
He adds the peppers and onions when he adds the beans so that the flavours are blended.
Sheesh!Update:  Our 12 qt Kuhn Rikon, model 30333 arrived.
Miss Vickie shared her recipe for making garlic mashed potatoes and polenta at the same time in her Kuhn Rikon interview (linked from her website).
It cost more than the 10.5" round griddle, but the shipping weights were 9 and 5 lbs respectively.
The lid is heavy duty, but the pot is constructed of a lighter guage stainless.
Not a deal breaker, but one more thing to bother with.
My Mom and Grandmother never had to use a flame tamer with their old pc's as the pots were very heavy.
This pot is still hefty, especially with food in it, so maybe the lighter weight of the pot adds to ease of use.
My solution was to use a huge cast iron fry pan and set the pressure cooker inside the pan.
The frypan allowed about 2" of air space between the sides of the pressure cooker and the sides of the cast iron frypan.
This actually worked well, so I investigated the possibility of using a cast iron griddle instead of a cast iron heat diffuser.
By flipping it over, you have a choice of a griddle or a grill.
So, you can add a "flame tamer" to your kitchen AND a griddle or combination griddle/grill and save some money.Now for our first cooking adventure.
We chose a recipe out of a Lorna Sass cookbook.
The recipe took much longer than we anticipated.
Part of this was due to the extra time we took to make sure we were doing everything right.
There is a difference in size, but the handle design is different between the two.
The 7.4 quart has a long handle on one side and a short one on the other side.
In cooking only a single recipe, the short handle got hotter to touch than the long handle.
I am glad we bought the 7.4 quart with the long handle.
I am also glad we bought the 7.4 quart over a 6 quart pot.
Many recipes call for a 6 quart pot.
They will fit nicely in the 7.4 quart pot with some additional head room.
This equates to a little greater distance between the valves in the lid and the food in the pot.
We have three Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers that we use almost every time we cook - this is the main cookware we use.
It's fast, easy, and it saves energy because it takes less time to cook.
And the food's great - I like eating at home better than any restaurant.
As an &#34;old timer&#34;, I remember when my mom used a pressure cooker a lot for making meals.
I've used it several times and it's amazing how fast they cook food.
This has several safety features and it quite easy to use.
and a very nice cooker to do it in.
After using this item for months I am 100% happy with it.
As long as you treat the gasket with respect, like with any pressure cooker, the unit operates perfectly.
It is amazing the cooking time these pots can do a job.
This concerned me, worried the pot would warp or something, but it did a great job.
Now use it for just browning at times.
It heats up instantly and responds quickly to the stove tops heat settings.
My first one still looks like new and performs as it did on day one.I love doing research on potential purchases.
Fagor was the only brand that I could find in local stores.
I bought one  and  returned it, as on the second use I couldn't bring it up to pressure.
I didn't want a cheap model as I has had such good luck with my Kuhn Rikon for all of these years.
I prefer to buy things in person, touching, examining etc.
I had made the right choice.I use my PC for risotto, soups, chicken cacciatore, spare ribs, beans, rice, lamb shanks and on and on.
I primarily use Lorna Sass' PC books and have yet to make a bad dish.
If you are cooking for 1 - 3, this is a great size and will give you leftovers to freeze.
Just don't fill it past the recommended line 2/3 thirds for most things, 1/2 for beans.
The inside is clearly marked.I got an excellent price thru Amazon.
This sat in my cart for awhile as I waffled back and forth between brands.
The price changed several times and then finally it dropped soooo low that I knew this was an omen.
Within a day or so, it went back up almost $60.00.If you are researching, pondering, waffling ,,,, STOP.
You won't do any better than this Kuhn Rikon, price or quality wise.
This is my second buy of the same product, because I loved the first one so much.
Kuhm Rikon makes the best pressure cookers, and they include a great little manual and cook book.
I had wanted a pressure cooker and was trying to decide on one when I saw this one written about in Southern Living magazine.
I must say, it has helped me put meals on the table in record time and saved a lot of waiting/energy.
I also recommend you buy the Lorna Sass pressure cookbooks if you have never really used a pressure cooker before.
I have had this pressure cooker for seven years now and would not trade it for any other.
If you are new to pressure cooking, imagine having a flavorful stew in the middle of summer without heating up your kitchen.
Or, coming home from work and cooking chicken and the vegetables and seasonings of your choice in less than 20 minutes.
I find the texture of brown rice cooked in the pressure cooker much better than when a pressure cooker is not used.
You do have to adjust to pressure cooker cooking which is why I recommend Lorna Sass's books.
For example, you need more herbs because somehow the flavor gets muted.
So I took that one back and after much research chose the Kuhn Rikon based on reviews and have been happy with my choice.
The kinds of things you cook in a pressure cooker generally get better on reheating anyway.
I cut up my vegetables and meats in the morning before I go to work, then I can quickly make dinner when I get home.
Of course you can do something similar with a slow cooker but I never liked the texture of the food cooked in a slow cooker.
You do have to stay close to the pot to adjust the burner temperature so that the right pressure is maintained in the pot.
But things cook so quickly that I do not find this enough of a burden to stop using it.
This is my first pressure cooker set and I love it.
It really helps if you can find classes on how to use your pressure cookers.
After using other stainless steel pressure cookers over the past thirty-plus years, we decided to update our older 6-quart model for this one.
We are extremely happy with this purchase so far.
We've made vegetarian chili (using TVP instead of meat), Pan-in-pot method brown rice, pulled pork (from an 8+ pound shoulder roast) all with great success.
The puled pork was extremely tender and surprisingly delicious.
One thing we needed to re-learn:  determining when to turn the heat down as the cooker gets to cooking pressure.
The older cooker makes a racket with the jiggler rocking and steam hissing.
We really appreciate how quickly this cooker responds to the flame adjustments on the stove.
Overall, we are impressed and sorry we waited so long to make this investment.
Like most good things in life, you get what you pay for...this is expensive and worth it!.
It is the prettiest pot I ever owned and I have some lovely Farberware.
I use a pressure cooker almost every day.
I like making vegan soups for dinner, and this size is just perfect for one or two people.
I had a Splendid brand cooker for many years but once the lock started to leak it was just a mess.
You can definitely tell the difference in brands this is really top of the line.
Looking at the mechanism there is really no way this can leak.
I will let you know how much I love it!Update:Still love it!  I makes perfect beans, perfect soups, high quality, cleans really well.
It is the "Cadillac" of pressure cookers!  I really enjoy it.
I used the app a lot at the start, but now I am pretty cool about just using the cooker on my own.
It's amazing, will change your life, and of course save you a tonne of time on your cooking.
This is my 2nd Kuhn Rikon pressure cooker.
I wanted something smaller than my previous one.
This one works out well for smaller portions and smaller cuts of meat.
These pressure cookers are expensive but hold up extremely well.
I've not needed to replace the silicone seal yet.
I got my 1st pressure cooker more than 10 years ago and it still looks like new!.
It makes cooking super fast and food comes out delicious.
The short version is that I got Kuhn Ricon Family Style pressure cooker 8qt.
WMF only sells their entry level model ("Perfect Plus") in the US and it is getting mixed reviews.
The improved model ("Perfect Ultra") is better and more durable but not available in the US.
Fissler seems to have similar issues as WMF "Perfect Plus": its plastic handle is prone to cracking.
The measurements on KR's website are a bit confusing and incomplete.
Downside: not ideal for making small serving sizes.
A cup of water just covers the bottom.
Once the pressure reaches the desired level, turn the heat down to maintain the pressure level (about 2-3 on my induction cook top).
Initially, I was concerned about whether it could be opened and closed easily.
Once I used it, my worries went away.
Position the lid so that the arrow points to the handle, twist, it closes.* To de-pressure: 3 modes: 1) fast: less than 30 sec.
by rinsing the rim of the lid with cold running water; 2) normal: about 1 min.
by pressing the valve with a spoon; 3) slow: about 10 min.
The above time is based on steaming with very little water in the pc.
With the KR rack on the WMF trivet, food is away from the water and double rack cooking is possible.
Lentils/ Beans - the only way to cook them is in a pressure cooker.
I can't believe I managed w/o one all this time.
The size has worked out well for 2 people.
Upgraded review to 5 stars (from 4).***************************************************************September 2010Very new to using a pressure cooker.
After much thought and vacillation we settled on the Kuhn Rikon 5L duromatic inox (name of the pressure valve used) pressure cooker.
The valve on the top is a bit more elaborate but both models seem to have all the same features.
The Top Model has a valve on the top that is almost like a stove burner knob and you dial in the setting.
On the model we bought, the duromatic, you have to press the little knob on the top to release pressure.
We recently became vegetarians and cooking beans/ lentils in a stockpot is a day long affair.
I had soaked chickpeas for 15 hours and then I cooked them in a 5 qt stockpot on the stove top.
After 3.5 hours they were still somewhat crunchy.Soaked 1.5 cups of chickpeas for ~15h and it took 18 minutes to cook in the pressure cooker.
Took another 20 minutes for the pot to cool down before I opened it.
The stockpot version had a lot of chickpeas losing their skin and splitting.
This is something you can see on their website in Switzerland (KuhnRikon.ch) but is not sold in the U.S.A.! Item # 2002.
I spoke to them and got no conclusive reason as to why they wouldn't sell it here.
One cannot even buy this from the swiss website !! They look like stackable cake pans each with a diameter of 22 cm.
If one wants to cook rice/ multiple veggies altogether, this would be invaluable.
You use one container for each item, stack them and fire up the pressure cooker.
Anyway, so I need to find something that will work.
Here's why - the pressure cooker has a base (5L) and a lid with the valve.
So before you put the pressure cooker lid on your pot sits there with no lid.
I ended up paying $30 bucks and ordered the lid.
After an additional 1 minute the black stem kept moving upwards and a second red line was visible.
This is the high setting for the pressure cooker.
I turned the burner down to a 4 for about 1 minute and then to low for the remaining time (~13 minutes).
Once the 18 minutes were up I turned off the stove and let it sit for 20 minutes.
Very nice product! I hope this helps clarify any thoughts concerns you may have!.
I did a lot of research on pressure cookers before investing in this (pricey!) one, and my wife and I couldn't be happier.
It is a pleasure to use - and we use it very often.
We also like the fact that this model does NOT have a long bulky handle - making it much easier to store in our cabinet.
Pressure cooking changed the way I approach my recipes anymore.
It has virtually replaced my slow cooker, unless I am using that for my skirt steak recipe.
It saves energy and cooks in more flavor.
I never throw away vegetable trimmings since I recycle them into broths and stocks.
I always keep a large freezer bag in the freezer and add scraps until it is full.
Then I pressure cook them into a very tasty broth in less than an hour.This Kuhn Rikon is very well made and works perfectly.
It is simple to use, and it comes with clear instructions and recipes.
I am giving this model as Christmas gifts to family this year.
I really like the design of this cooker, after all, who wants something grotesque in your kitchen?  It is also a great pressure cooker.
Easy to clean and easy to lock up to get your meal started.
If you've ever watch a cooking show and see a chef fuss with getting their cooker working properly, it wasn't a Kuhn Rikon.
Pressure valve is no fuss and practically intuitive (like pull it up and down to make sure it's free moving).
Expensive, yes, but I'd gladly spend the money again for another.
Quiet on the stove too!We have this one and Kuhn Rikon's 5 quart pressure cooker and use both pretty equally.
Have even used these to can with! Love them! :).
Here's the way to cook perfect risotto in a few minutes.
The recipe comes with the product and we found many other great pressure cooker recipes on the company's website.
This is a time,energy and labor saver for any kitchen, it's no wonder most European kitchen have several of these.
I deliberately went searching for a modern pressure cooker, partly because every Vegan cookbook that I own considers it a &quot;must have&quot;.
I was always somewhat afraid I would end up with pot roast on my ceiling.
The Kuhn Rikon 5-Liter Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker is a dream come true.
The 5-Liter size is adequate for a small family or if cooking just for one or two people.
I, personally, have not owned one and so there is a bit of a learning curve.
But the measurement and timing guides for different foods are comprehensive and very easily understandable.
The foods I have cooked came out just as expected in much shorter amounts of time than regular cooking methods.
Plus, I like the fact that nutrients are sealed in and foods retain their moisture.
The stainless steel pot and cover clean up easily.
The engineering and design are beautiful and I am totally happy with this cooker.
It is a most welcome addition to my kitchen!.
We are a family of 2 who eat a plant-based (no oil) diet for cardiovascular reasons.
I cannot possibly imagine why I have waited so long to purchase this perfect-sized SAFE pressure cooker.
It is my most prized piece of cookware.
The best thing about aging is that we no longer need a lot to eat.
Finally, I can take advantage of this 2.6-quart braiser which can handle recipes for 2-3 people.
This pan allowed me to brown the ground meat.
When it was time to add the lid, it took less than 5 minutes to come up to pressure.
Voila, a tasty dinner for 2, with leftovers for lunch.
Well, I love both!  It just depends on the recipe I am using.
The old-style steam vent is no problem at all-- I don't need the new Duromatic Top, it appears.
I am very handy with a wooden spoon.
Love the size and the pressure cooker (8.5 quart).
I reordered from Amazon and bought this one to replace it.
I am extremely pleased with the cooker and Amazon's service.
The smaller size is fabulous for vegetables and smaller meals.I've cooked beets, carrots, chicken Marsala, Lentils, Red Beans and Rice and countless other dishes.
This is my 2nd PC, my other is a large WMF/Fissler Blue Point.
I needed something a little bit smaller and this is perfect.
What is especially nice about the Kuhn Rikon is for some reason they require less liquid to come up to pressure than the Fissler.
For some things, it doesn't matter but for others you have to cook to reduce the juices after removing the lid.
They're both beautifully crafted and a pleasure to use.
Using a PC is an incredible timesaver and make life in the kitchen so much more efficient.
The only thing I am upset about which has nothing to do with the quality of this product itself.
Simply adjust the heat to keep it leveled to the red markings on the top of the cover.
You might say to yourself "I want the hissing sound" so it could let you know the food is cooking.
The hissing noise is there only when its needed so dont be scared of the quietness with this Kuhn Rikon pressure cooker.
My only complaint is that hand cleaning the lid can be a little difficult.
But I'm not sure if there is a better "dishwasher safe" way to design the lid.
So, I can't really hold this against them.
yet another kitchen item we now can't imagine living without.
this model is easy to use and clean.
the pan is as heavy as our 18/10 Cuisinart pots, while the top is made of lighter stuff.
and it's easy to control, so i don't see any the advantage to the slightly more expensive &#34;top&#34; dial model.
Several years ago, I took a class on pressure cooking and this was the cooker that the class focused on.
I had never used a pressure cooker before and had heard nothing but horror stories.
After the class, I purchased the 5-liter cooker and have been quite happy with it for nearly 10 years.
I am a vegetarian and, even though I am single, I like to cook up beans every other week.
That way I can have a nice selection available in my freezer during the week.
With this cooker, I can cook up several different varieties in just a couple of hours.
There are markings on the inside so that you can easily avoid over-filling it.
The little guide that comes with the cooker has helpful little charts.
The only addition to this package that I would make would be a much more in depth cook book focusing on pressure cooking.
This is my first experience with a pressure cooker so I don't have much of a frame of reference.
Again - I have no frame of reference since this is my first PC.
My grandmother and my mother both used pressure cookers frequently.
Some other reviewers have noted that the Kuhn Rikon requires more monitoring than jiggle-type pressure cookers.
Jiggle-type pressure cookers release steam throughout the cooking process.
This provides confirmation that the cooker is operating through sound.
It IS convenient if this is what you are used to.
However, these cookers require more liquid to achieve pressure and as a result, certain items can come out more watery than I prefer.
As a result, the "sound of pressure", or hiss is missing.
A small valve with two red lines provides confirmation that moderate and full pressure have been achieved.
Without sound to guide you, one must rely on visual clues.
This does require monitoring and a little guess work.
However, once you determine how your cooktop and pressure cooker interact, it is the same every time.
From that point on, you simply wait for the red line to appear and turn your cooktop down to your pre-determined setting.
The enclosed system allows fast, high temperature cooking without heating up your kitchen;3.
The benefits of a lower liquid requirement to achieve high pressure can not be overstated.The Kuhn Rikon system is different but produces superior results.
If you're a Modernist Cuisine fan, I would also like to suggest the caramelized butternut squash - it's eye opening.
They recommend the Kuhn Rikon as the best pressure cooker available - but those of us who own one already know that.
Worth every penny - because I know my Kuhn Rikon will last longer than I do!.
Ok, it is pricey!  BUT, this is a really nice piece of kitchen gear, and is a pleasure to use.
I'm not sure how we ever lived without a pressure cooker but this is one handy piece of gear.
Reviewed many choices before settling on this one.
Good words from the Modernist Cuisine guys and Dave Arnold tipped me over the edge.
The stockpot is well made, easy to use and fairly easy to clean.
We use this on our gas stove with a diffuser underneath which seems to keep the pressure a bit more controllable.
Having one that's too small is far, far worse than one that is slightly too big.
You can always add less liquid to the large one.
I read several of the other reviews before my purchase, I cannot imagine how you could improve upon on the quality of this cooker.
This allows it to cool down naturally within a reasonable amount of time.
I can see why people love this brand.
Since it takes about 45 minutes in the rice cooker, I doubt that I'll ever use that appliance again.
With high energy costs these really save a bundle.
They still look great after all this use and are very easy to clean.
I often make my dogs food in them using chicken, vegetables and rice.
It cooks so quickly!Update 7/5/12 - I'm still loving this pressure cooker.
I also use the pot without the cover for making everything from soups to pasta.
I've been using this cooker for about four years now and it has exceeded every expectation.
It does so quietly, accurately, with smooth distribution of heat due to copper being sandwiched into the bottom.
All around a true 5 star performer.We've used it hundreds of times with excellent results.
Easy to clean, this is a cooks dreamware.
It is safe and easy to use and is holding up very well.
UPDATE: After 3 years of use, my UL valve is broken now.
It's now hardened and letting steam escape, making pressure unable to build up.
It was prompt and easy.The small lid near the valve does easily broken with that plastic.
I recommend not to take that out to clean often or with extreme care.
It is not that really functional apart from shielding off the stream.
Remember Grandmom's pressure cooker with the rattling pressure control weight and all the associated hassle of using the thing? Well, all that's history.
Moroccan lamb stew, chicken cacciatore, braised lamb shanks, and many more recipes have all been delicious.
And they all cook in 30 minutes or less -- yes, that's right -- half an hour.
The prep time usually takes a preliminary half hour, so a great meal in 60 minutes with no fuss.
This looks acceptable and functions well based on my initial uses.
It's thin material and does not necessary look like it will last a lifetime.
This is a great tool although I think I got one a couple of sizes to big.
I am very impressed with this pressure cooker.
I have 2 big canning pressure cookers that I use for canning, but this is the first one for cooking regular meals.
It reaches pressure quickly, and the pressure releases quickly when through cooking.
The beets are the greatest ever, as the beet flavor is more intense compared to boiling in water.
Have cooked chicken and pot roast so far and both came out well.
I've had a Presto and I upgraded to FagorAmerica which was defective.
A friend talked me into biting the bullet and paying for this one.
It is SOOOOOO WORTH IT! I can't even begin to explain the difference in quality and performance.
Several of the recipes in the accompanying cookbook were smash hits at our house.
Wish I had gotten one sooner, I was always afraid the one my mom had when I was growing up would explode.
I could kick myself that I waited this long.
Not to mention that the risotto absorbed virtually all the broth and was perfectly firm and chewy but completely done.
I was unsure whether to go with this size and decided a bit smaller than the old Mirro one I had would do fine.
I'm SO glad I replaced my old one.
This uses much less water and I don't miss the noise.
I find I like brown rice made in this rather than in my rice cooker!.
This pressure cooker is heavy duty, well-constructed, not your grandfather's pressure cooker.
In the month since we received it, we have cooked chicken wings, ribs, pot roast, and potatoes.
Also, due to the thick stainless construction of the pot, it was easy to wash.
In short, a pot of the nicest old fashioned quality.
I'm a working mom with limited time but big ambitions.
Baby food makers that steam and puree cost $100 and none of them seem to be without problems.
They also seem like they'd have a limited shelf life for the price.
Traditional stove-top steaming takes forever and I just wouldn't stick with it.This is a $200 pot.
There are other Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers that are cheaper, but they are very small and therefore penny wise, pound foolish.
the first one only lasted 25 years! Powerful pressure, makes food taste great.
This pressure cooker was given to me YEARS ago.
It probably has seen 600 uses+ by our family in its life.
This pressure cooker set is a great entry level set, although I find the large size sometimes not large enough.
But, watch what you are purchasing, there are 2 separate types of lids on the Duromatic pressure cooker.
If you have the extra money, this other lid is worth it--especially if you are a beginner.
I regret that I bought the duromatic set without realizing the difference in the lids.
I saw the price of the set and jumped on it without realizing the difference.
My favorite is Miss Vickies Book of Pressure Cooker recipes, also found on amazon.
I'm a single fellow who prefers to cook than eat out.
I have been bowled over by this product and it's convenience.
Because I cook for one, I mostly use the frying pan with complete satisfaction.
I make different chilies, bean dishes (re-fried, hummus, etc.), roasts, soups, vegetables; the list goes on.
I cook up a week's worth and I'm off to the races.
I do like to read the reviews (specially the lower ratings) to see what I must be conscious of when using the product.
I plan on buying this brand (not necessarily this combination) for my children's families.
(9May2009)  I'm still so pleased with this product I could just fart (I do a lot of bean dishes).
(30May2010)  I'm still cooking up a storm with this set; going strong.
Everything is moist and tasty and wonderfully textured.
Now, I can see why pressure cookers are so popular in Europe.The Kuhn Rikon comes to pressure fast--5-6 times faster than the Fagor.
This brand and model came highly recommended by Modernist Cuisinie and has rave reviews at hippressurecooking dot com, and was very well priced.
I can say I am extremely happy with this purchase.
It is very well made, cleans so easily, and has several levels of safeguards to prevent over pressurization.
It is very easy to use and does a great job!.
I bought this pressure cooker about 3 years ago to replace and older style pressure cooker that I had.
I like that you can safely release the pressure by just pressing the knob with the handle of long utensil (like a wooden spoon).
After 3 years of use, the seal is still tight and the pressure cooker works as well as it did on day one.
The only drawback I see at this time is the huge price increase.
I just cut it into cubes and pan fry (with a bit of oil and diced onions) to give it some color first.
Then I put them into the pressure cooker and add some water and spices.
Cook for about 30 minutes and voila, tender beef to compliment any dish.
They don't touch, each other and there is rubber at the base, so it's not going to rust.
I use mine all the time and it works great.
Be sure to dry it with the whip pointing down so water doesn't accumulate in the base and cause bacteria or dirt.
These hold up well and are the perfect size for most jobs.
Every kitchen should have different size whips, this one is well made and does what it should do!  I highly recommend!!!.
It feels very nice! It is made in the USA! All aspects of it are perfect!.
It's the perfect size for mixing something together in a 16 oz.
This mixer whip is the perfect little gadget.
I think I use this more than my normal size ones.
It's perfect for anything small, like salad dressings, eggs, etc.
I got rid of all my other whisk but this one and the Light Design French Whip 12-inch of whip.
BEAUTIFULLY MADE PRODUCT...I PURCHASED ONE AND PURCHASED A FEW OTHERS IN DIFFERENT SIZES...WHO SAYS NOTHING IS MANUFACTURES IN AMERICA ANYMORE...GET THESE...BE STOKED?.
i did think when i ordered it though that the 8 inches did not include the handle, but it does.
it doesnt feel flimsy in your hand or going through whatever you're mixing.
The handle has a good feel and the quality of the whip is excellent.
I have several of the old all-wire whips and find that this is quickly becoming my preferred utensil.
This whisk is just the right size for my smaller saucepans and the handle is perfect for my hand.
Some whisks have thin handles that can be uncomfortable.
The construction appears very sturdy and high quality.
i been using this for about a year now and its been great to me love it light weight compacts but not to small.
Great control, great whisking action, fits perfectly with a tiny footprint in my top drawer.
The feel and balance are perfect in my hand.
The tines are a nice heft and do a good job of mixing and aerating ingredients.
It is not flimsy, like some other whisks I have bought and had to return.
This whisk does the job and makes a nice addition to my utensil collection.
I have started to simplify my life and have gone back to basics.
Instead of using a machine to blend and mix my batters, I now use a stainless steel mixing bowl and this wonderful whisk.
It is very pretty, also, in my favorite pink color.
Cleans easily, doesn't get liquid between the handle and the wires, and whisks just like it's supposed to.
really performs much better than my not so high quality whisk it replaces.
wondering why i used a lousy whisk for so many years!.
When Cooks Illustrated recommends it, it's nearly always excellent.
This is a fine product but the handle is a bit thin.
Perfect size and width for mixing smaller batches of batter.
like one egg or things in a small bowl.
I believe they have a smaller size one though.
This is great for whipping french toast batter and lots of eggs at once.
It  manages to get herculean levels of air into scrambled eggs making them incredibly fluffy.
I bought this whisk based on its top rating from Cook's Illustrated.
I use it often and it does the job, has a nice hold, feels solid and well-made.
I really prefer the Best Manufacturer French whisk because of its narrower streamlined construction, unlike the bulb whisks.
Its much easier to handle and they take up less room in my utensil holder.
I looked at just about every home center store around and could not find them, except for Amazon.
I should have paid more attention to the reviews and contrasted the descriptions.
What I was looking for was a balloon whip for egg whites.
This will do the job, but it is not really "balloon enough".
You end up with too much arm movement.
It is also either 2-3 inches longer than it would be ideal for me in this usage.
so I guess I'll be looking for a 14" balloon whip now ;)That said, I can not fault the product.
I have 3 of their whips on this series.
This plus the other 2 smaller ones have the looks and are nicely put together.
They do the work you would expect from a regular whip.
So I'm giving it a 5-star rating based on the product itself as opposed to my mistake.
I have several whisk that has a silicon based, but this is my first wire whisk.
I like the length of the base of the whisk.
It's slim compared to the others I've seen,used or what I have.
I have small hands, so the handle is perect, I have more control of what I'm mixing or sifting.
But silicon work great for not scratching surfaces.
I think no kitchen is complete without at least 1 whisk, and this one is it.
It's great when making a white sauce, also for just making a roux.
monster wisk for use at county fair to make breakfast for 4-H kids.
We cook french toast, pancakes and scrambled eggs and using a small hand wisk with 3 dozen eggs is a pain.
We used to have a large wisk like this one but it disappeared.
As reviewed by America's Test Kitchen, this is really the best whisk I've used.
First, watch how you search for items like "French Whip".
I put mine in the freezer for an hour first.
No problems with any items I've bought from Best Manufacturers-I recommend their cooking gear.
However, it's excellent for those deep mixing bowls for baking and pastries.
Also does well in skillets for sauces and gravies if you don't have a flat whisk.
Not a necessary tool, as you won't be swayed to put away your balloon whisk.
Works so much better than a regular whisk when making gravy or stirring roux.
This whisk is sturdy and well-made, with all indications that it will give me years of good use.
This is well made and is perfect for help with deglazing the bottom of a pan for sauces and gravies.
It works well to incorporate thick tomato paste into recipes, as well.
I should have purchased one of these a long time ago.
Yes, it's nearly single-purpose (although, I love it for making my notorious triple-chocolate pudding).
No, you probably don't make gravy as often as your mother did.
Second, it's almost two-dimensional, so it's optimized for scraping the bottom of the skillet or roaster you're making roux in.
It does one thing, and it does it really well.
This would make a great stocking stuffer for whoever roasts the Christmas beast in your family.
My brother has one of these and every time I used it, I thought it was great.
My sister, who's quite into cooking, also used it and liked it very much.
Eventually, I got around to buying one for myself and gave her one as a gift.
I ordered this on accident, but kept it anyways because it seemed like a good idea and I'm something of an amateur chef.
The steel whisk parts are thicker than usual, and do a great job of breaking loose bits in a pan.
As far as whisking gravies, yeah - I never want to make a gravy without one.
Definitely a great purchase and this is a solid, well-constructed product.
These are not easy to find in the stores but necessary for the chef!  Great product at a great price.
I didn't know how much I needed this tool.
But I am glad to have it among MY kitchen arsenal.
I saw Ree Drummond using it on her show and she always seemed to use it with ease.
She made many sauces and eggs and batters.
So I thought I would give it a try and it's great.
this little whip is fantastic for when you are making gravy's, it grabs all the goodness from the bottom of the pan.
I have several whisks that I like and use quite a bit.
I like this one for gravies etc -- it really can reach in the edges of cast iron skillets nicely.
I have even used it to stir thick grits on the stove top to keep them from getting clumpy.
this is amazing very strong makes smoothing of graves, dry mixes and milk products fast also whips eggs to a fluffy goodness.
This wonderful flat whip or whisk gets all the brown bits off the roasting pan after you have cooked a turkey, roast or chicken.
It helps you get into all the corners and really mix the gravy to a beautiful consistency.
It also works well for use in frying pans, etc., for loosening up the fond on the bottom for pan sauce.
Made very well, with special care taken to make sure it does not rust inside the handle.
This product is very well made and  is exactly as described, being very wide gets the job done much faster...Rich.
Does the job of a balloon whisk without the hassle of top-heavy handle flopping out of the pan.
The handle does get a little hot though, but not bad.
I purchased this item hoping it would help me get into the pan's bottom corner/edge better and it does that very well.
I have found wonderful ways of using this flat wisk, however, do not expect it to work like a circular wisk, as it does not.
IMO it folds rather than wisks but I still would buy it.
This is really a multi-purpose tool for me.
I use it to pull out food from hot oil.
I whisk whatever needs whisking, and it does the job very fast.
The handle is a nice wood and has a great weight to it.
What's neat is the way they have affixed the wires to the handle.
They have it molded inside the hollow metal top of the handle with a hard plastic/silicone type substance.
It's perfect for long-term, because usually these type of whisks will have a wire come loose over time.
The mold however doesn't seem as though it could do that very easily.The quality is top notch.
Glad I chose it over some others that were slightly cheaper.
I ended up getting the 12" as well.
You will need a big bowl to work in.
I prefer a 6 quart stainless steel bowl, for example, or my copper sabayon bowl which is roughly the size of a Citroen.
All these qualifiers aside, egg whites run and hide when they see me drag this out of the drawer.
Best products, in general, are well-made and highly affordable.
Best makes excellent heavy-duty commercial products that are well suited for use in the home kitchen.
This Best 12-Inch Balloon Whisk is great for whipping up whole eggs or blending sauces in a stainless steel bowl.
This size is fairly easy for anyone to use.
Also for the serious enthusiast, nothing else will do except an unlined (chilled) pure copper bowl.
(I found mine at a bargain in an out-of-the-way antiques store.).
Great price for a high quality piece of essential kitchen equipment.
Exactly what I was looking for but even better quality than I expected.
I make large quantities of hot fudge sauce, yes gallons at a time, cannot be done without one of these.
A great whisk is one of the basic tools for both success and good fun in the kitchen.
I upgraded some of my kitchen tools and utensils and this whisk made the cut.
I chose to buy this whisk because it is made in America, the large size, and the quality of the construction.
I bought this size solely for large jobs, like mashed potatoes.
Smaller whisks would require much more muscle for the job.
I love it! Yes, it is very large so keep your storage options in mind when ordering.
Outstanding product; never used one until ALTON BROWN explained the uses.
I like the design as it keeps the wires loosely connected at the top.Really good addition to kitchen.
I finally found a balloon whip the proper size to whip up cream.
I used  this several times over the last few weeks and it holds up well.
When I had a store I sold these for years and have never had one returned.
Some women collect dolls others go nuts over diamonds.
I get weak in the knees for All-Clad.
Made in the USA, top quality, lifetime guarantee, etc.
Imagine my disappointment upon discovering their utensils have been outsourced to China.
Recently, I was searching for whisks/whips made in the USA.
I discovered Best Manufacturers' whips/whisks are made in the States.
The great reviews along with the fact they're produced domestically clinched it.
They clean-up very well whether washing by hand or in the dishwasher.
The ring-less design was an issue for me because I hang all my cookware.
Frees up so much room in my kitchen.
My solution, though some may think it's quirky, is to hang these whips right-side-up.
I'm able to hang up to 3 on one hook.
Hope this helps anyone out there that likes to hang their cookware on hooks/pot racks.
I recently ordered several whips in varying sizes and styles, and am most impressed with this 14" balloon whip.
It is very large and sturdy, exactly what I was looking for when mixing big jobs or in deep pots.
I bought this to go with the copper bowl I purchased and it is a comfortable whip in my hand.
I like the patina that is forming on the handle.
I bought it to match my copper mixing bowl.
It feels like professional quality and works great.
It also does not rust at all in the dishwasher.
If you like to cook/bake as much as I do, you will really like this whisk!.
I bought this for our kitchen last year on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen.
It does the job, cleans up easily and doesn't rust.
I don't know how the wood handle would take to a dishwasher, so we wash it by hand.
At 1/16" the wires are way too thick for egg whites or whip cream.
The whisk is just the right size to make marriange in a copper bowl but not to big to store.
This is a very good whip, but is too large for everyday use.
10- or 12-inch would be more useful for everyday.
Beefy handle makes for a solid grip of the whisk.
I searched long and hard for a US-made whisk, and this one was worth the wait.
We use it almost exclusively, but I especially love using it with our copper bowl for whipping up cream.
Decent cost, great size, great weight - love to use it!.
A must for someone who likes to beat things :) Nice copper handle also, matches your copper bowl.
This is a well made balloon whip that is perfect for whisking big bowl, fluffy lightweight batters by incorporating air.
Multiple loops of wire at the bottom and large balloon diameter make this whip much more efficient than my older whip.
Really does a nice job of incorporating air into batter.
Whips cream so quickly that I've stopped dragging out my KitchenAid to do the job.
It is comfortable and just the right length for my needs.
This one looks great and it is a substantial piece for the price.
The handle is sturdy and the wires not flimsy at all.
This is a great whip and I highly recommend it.
Like the French whip I purchased, this is an excellent piece of cooking toolery-well made, attractive in a retro way, and pleasant to use.
This balloon whip is best used in a large bowl, for large-volume jobs.
I prefer the wood handles over metal ones, purely because they're more comfortable in my hand.
I recently purchased 3 sets of these checkerboard cake pans.
I baked 9 (half inch) layers to make a Praline Doberge cake.
They also are great to bake my biscuits in.
I stack them for storage by putting a napkin between each pan (keeps them from sticking together).
First, about half of a batch of boxed mix is all that will fit into these very shallow pans.
If they don't rise and bake at the same rate, your checkerboard will look more like marble cake.
My suggestion is that instead of using two different flavor cake mixes, just use a white cake mix and divide it into two parts.
Color half with food coloring to give you the checkerboard effect.
The directions say to fill pans no more than half-way, and they aren't kidding.
I cut off and threw away more than was left in the pan on my first try.
Maybe it depends on the mix, and how much it rises.
The third problem should have been obvious, but I'm not that clever.
Anyway, I cook more for pleasure than necessity, and this was just a little more annoying than I had planned.
I'm not giving up, but the pursuit of the perfect checkerboard cake has so far eluded me.
I do love the checkerboard cake pans!  The only thing i'd like is for them to have more than one plastic insert.
I know, none of the sets do, but it's still a pain to have to wash it between filling each pan!.
It worked quite nicely the first time around.
I would offer these tips to help make it easier.
I also decided to use a large piping bag for each of the batters to help me to fill up the rings.
My checkerboards came out perfectly!  I was really pleased!  I might add more chocolate next time.
I wish that there were 3 different dividers to make it faster, though.
its cool cant wait to use it in the future and make some killer tacos yummy ymmuy thank you so much.
One thing to consider is how many tacos you need prepped at once.
Fine for a &#34;build your own&#34; taco presentation, but too ungainly for the table.
After trying to find a way to make bacon-weave taco shells for a few weeks, I happened upon these.
Good size, and they make the bacon weave process very simple to make taco shells.
Non-stick surface makes the shells slide off and the grease drips off onto the baking trays underneath.
I put them in my dishwasher and they are good to go.
Since I like to cook Mexican and hate to use ready-made anything, I rarely used corn tortillas.
I ordered two of these racks and it was the answer to my problem.
After I have formed the tortillas, I spray the racks with a little cooking spray and bake them in the oven until they are crunchy.
They come out hot and pliable enough not to shatter when you fill them.
Sometimes, I add some sea salt when I bake them.
I know other people simply hang them through the oven racks, but they seem to be a little to closed to fill easily.
These racks are built very well and I'll use them for many, many years.
If your trying to say away from fried foods like deep frying taco shells this is the unit for you.
It works really well and does a decent job in cooking a shell that's better for you.
We can bake them when we need them and we don't have to pay a higher price for pre-formed Taco shells.
Going to Amazon allowed me to review all the taco baking devices available and finding the most practical one for us.
With all these benefits, we will never buy store-bought, pre-formed Tacos, ever.
Become believers, buy one of these and be happy!.
Well constructed, I also bought the Kitchen supply taco rack, use one for shaping and the other for filling.
I love being able to bake up healthy tacos with ease.
I bought one of these for myself and one for my sister-in-law.
This is a sturdy, well-made item, and it works perfectly.
One small detail annoys me; the photo of a taco shell on the packaging was clearly NOT made using this baker--it was fried.
You can tell by the blistery little pockets that come from steam and hot oil; these do not form when you bake a corn tortilla.
Seems kind of a shame that they did even that small bit of false advertising, but I would still very much recommend this kitchen gadget.
I just have to learn not to move too fast with the loaded rack.
The design is nice with the ability to bake 4 tacos a time.
The only draw back that I had hence the 4 stars instead of 5 is the non-stick coating.
It has it's plus side with the easy clean-up, but the downside I had was the Tacos kept sliding off.
It works for me because I wanted the taco shape without frying them (trying to control my cholesterol).
I'm sure with a little trial and error you could figure out how to get them just how you like them.
I was skeptical, but these do actually work.
I had two of these were of inferior quality.
I make taco salad often and wanted something that would stand the wear and tear of constant use.
She was getting tired of buying shells that would end up broke out of the box.
So I ordered these and they are perfect.
Very well made product, easy to clean and easy to use.
First impression is how well made they are.
The tortillas come out perfectly and did not stick.
Really makes a taco salad taste like, well, a taco salad.
It really does a nice job and one is the correct size for a nice tostado.
It takes about eight minutes to prepare the shell.
Bakes up a nice shell for a variety of uses all with easy cleanup.
These Tortilla shell pans are well made and definitely non- stick.
Very easy to clean with light soap water.
I wonder if they can be used for pies.
They make great tortilla shells that can be filled with almost anything but soup.
They eat the contents and then help themselves to the &#34;juice soaked&#34; bowl.
If I had the time and money I would try to patent something like that for pet use.
Please don't leave a note that corn or flour tortillas are bad for my dogs.
Have you seen the ingredients in pet food?.
We have several pans made by Chicago Metallic, and have been satisfied with their quality.
The thickness of the metal make these shell pans very stiff, and they should endure many years of use.
I tried several attempts precisely following the mfg.
directions as well as trying other techniques found posted on the Internet.
I re-read most of the 43 reviews hoping to gain insight from others but nothing seemed on point.
I then decided to buy some regular flour tortillas.
directions.I lightly sprayed oil on one pan and not the other, and neither tortilla stuck to the pan, and no noticeable taste difference.
So the oil seems unnecessary.A 10-inch tortilla fully fits inside the pan.
I already had a set of these and purchased a second set.
Ordered 2 sets of these cause they were bigger than the other shell pans.
Can put a large tortilla in them and they're not sticking over the top.
Much larger that the 6.5 inch versions that we had been using.
Much more open to be able to fill the taco shells with abundant ingredients.
We use the store bought versions made for burritos.
Would love to make them with corn but finding a commercially made corn tortilla that big is problematic.
My girl wanted this for some mexican food and they worked like a charm.
Great price and now this item makes eating salads, ice cream, and mexican foods fun.
Ordered these from Amazon & I was very pleased with the results!!I used the large flour tortillas.Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Spray pans with Pam or similar spray.Place tortilla in pan & mold to fluting.Place directly on oven rack.
I used them right away and my husband loved his taco salad.
This item works great!  You should note, however, that if you're using smaller (taco size) tortillas this mold will be too large.
I received these for Christmas from my daughter.
We tried them for the first time, using the baked shells for a chicken salad, and they were perfect.
I used plain flour tortillas, but next time around I will try different kinds, or spice up the tortilla with seasonings before baking.
These are great for entertaining and an easy meal.
15 minutes in a sprayed bowl and you've got great taco bowls good for many meals.
Pretty neat with a slightly browned shell for your taco salads or what ever bowls.
We did 15 minutes @350 in our convection oven and they came out perfect.
I knew I would love these tortilla bowls the first time I saw them.
I always skipped tostadas because of the shell being fried.
These make the most tasty and delicious shells, and much better for your health because they are baked.
Spray the pans with oil, then steam the tortilla in the microwave for a few seconds to make it soft.
Lay in your pan and press it around the curves.
Then bake at 375 degrees for about 8 minutes.
Cool for 5 minutes and fill with your favorite fillings.
I purchased a set of these over ten years ago and use them often.
When we have guests, I simply bake as many as I need ahead of time.
When dinner time rolls around, I place them on plates, set out dishes of ingredients, and let everyone fill theirs the way they want.
Now I am buying sets as gifts for others because of the rave reviews I received.
If you do not like tacos, try filling them with some of your other favorite ingredients.
So as in experiment I made naan dough and made soup bowls for lentil soup.
That came out great! I can imagine baking other kinds of flat breads in them.
I can't believe I waited all this time to buy myself a set of these tortilla pans.
I have been purchasing that overpriced refrigerated taco salad kit in the grocery store.
These pans are heavy, high quality and will last a lifetime.
I can't believe the excellent quality for this low price.
We will make up the cost of these pans in less than a year now that we no longer buy that kit in the store.
We had taco salad night for the first time using these pans and they far exceeded my expectations.
I lightly sprayed my tortilla shell with olive oil and followed the instructions on the box.
The shells turned out crisp, golden brown and ready to fill in mere minutes.
We definitely will add taco salad to the menu more frequently.
If you are thinking about purchasing a set just do it.
Been wanting to try these for a while.
Hesitated because of other reviews on other brands.
The top edges are well rounded not sharp like some other pans I've read about.
Do need to pierce or weight done the tortilla so it won't puff up.
I have to say I am very surprised at how often we use these.
I like these because they are larger than what I usually see in the store and make the size I like.
Really great for taco salads but can be used for everything from salad to soup.
this is a great set..!!! Very slippery so not much sticks to it.
because in my stove my first cooked set were to dark so i would take 3 or 4 minuts off it.
Other than that a fun way to cook make salids serving trays out of them can eat as you go to the bottom.
These are the right size too for your large taco/burrito thingies.
You know, you could bake other foods in these also, such as fluted cake.
I came across these pans at a local bed bath store a couple of years ago and bought them on the spot.
I make my own tortilla's, and these pans work beautifully for crisping the shells for taco salads.
I have not used them yet but I think they will work well when making Tortilla salads.
The construction of the shells are non-stick and should work well.
I've had a set of these for about 14 years now and they still look like new.
They make crispy shells and are easy to clean.
The pans sold today are made in China.
They're nearly identical to my older pans - hopefully they'll hold up as well as my other two.
Quality was good and would recommend to others.
Seems better than those found in the stores.
I love my tortilla shell bakers!  They make taco salad shells quickly, easily, and the shells look great.
Gave a pair to my son who also is impressed with them.
Making taco salads couldn't be easier when using these shell pans! It's quick, easy and best of all very easy to clean.
Using flour tortillas the shells are light and crispy.
They work just as they are supposed to.
I put drained salsa extra lean ground beef, sliced olives ans shredded cheddar on top.
The shells came out of the pan very easily.
Just repurchased to send to a family member.
Old and young alike enjoyed their salads in these nifty shells!!!.
These tortilla shell pans was exactly what we wanted.
just follow the instructions on seasoning the shell pans and washing it.
We have used it about 5 times now and each time it comes out a nice golden brown.
Prior to these pans arriving, I had second thoughts about ordering them.
They definitely work as advertised, and I just made me 2 Tortilla Shells within the last few hours.
They came out perfect!  But, the best of all, they taste good and are really flaky and crispy to my surprise.
These will be making it on my Christmas list for later this year.
I have only used them once but they worked as I expected.
Look forward to many more uses in the years to come.
Will update if I feel the need to do so.
We purchased these to replace some older ones we had from a different manufacture.
These are much better quality and have a durable finish.
I love a great taco salad anytime and these make wonderful sized bowls for the large tortilla shells.
I wanted to give the shells a little bit more flavor.
Because of this, the shells moved a little bit and also started to puff up when cooking.
I had to watch this, and after five minutes, just tap the shells with a non-stick utensil, and let them bake for the recommended time.
They're easy to clean and the warrant seems fair (25 year replacement) for them.
These are the larger diameter ones and the kind you need for making a large individual salad like you might be served in a restaurant.
They also hold the smaller tortillas and can be used to make &#34;smaller&#34; yet &#34;wider&#34; smaller tortilla bowls than the mini ones.
Bought as a birthday gift as well for my daughter and daughter in law.
I make all kinds of Tostadas and Taco Salads are some of my favorites things to Cook in these Bowls.
The concentrated cleaners will damage the Non-Stick Finish on Bakeware.
~I wash mine by hand I don't have a Dishwasher, my own choice.
Chicago Metallic Tortilla Bowls have become my Favorite thing to Bake with and they are a Great way to Impress Family and Guests.
This product is so easy to use and convenient when you crave a taco salad.
The no stick is a big plus for an easy clean-up.
You can bake some ahead of time if company is coming.
The best part is the baking eliminates the fat the frying adds.
Good Product, well made and arrived on time.
This pan comes out of my cabinet for all national holidays and most parties.
Try adding Parmesan and Thyme as it suggests, the results are sensational.
I believe that anyone, even the most basic beginner cook, will be thrilled with the results the first time.
If you can make muffins or a cake you can make popovers.
They are wonderful for a cocktail party or as the bread in a multi-course meal.
If you want to stuff them with a chicken of shrimp salad for lunch I would suggest the six-popover pan for that application.
I work as a chef and we have been using one of these pans to bake popovers for at least 1.5 years.
It sits in a 400F oven for hours on end cranking out popovers that come out perfect every time.
While it is nonstick, it is still essential to grease (either with fat or nonstick spray) before adding your batter.
These are 3oz cups, what some consider "mini," but these still make popovers that are approximately 5" tall.
Our popover pan's nonstick coating is starting to chip on the outside of the cups, but the inside remains in great condition.
This is a nice heavy duty popover pan.
I use these for taking popovers to various activities where finger foods are required.
I tried some various new recipes and they worked very good and everyone liked them.
I had a standard-size popover pan that I stopped using because it inevitably dripped in the oven and created smoke.
This mini-pan does not drip or stick, and creates tasty popovers.
LOVE the pan!  It makes the most marvelous crispy on the outside and airy on the inside popovers.
I love the mini sized because they come out faster when serving a crowd.
On either the mini or the larger cupped pan, have not had a problem with the coating coming off.
if you have stuggled with popovers or yorkshire pudding, get these bad boys.
In spite of an old cranky oven, we had a prime rib and Yourkshipe pudding hit.
The Chicago Metallic Non Stick Mini Popover Pan is great.
Each cup is spaced by the sturdy wire rack design so that the individual  popover gets full, all around heat.
This design of single cup cooking make excellent popovers as the heat flows to all sides on even the center popovers cup.
I have been making the regular and the cheese popovers.
Even the cheese mix does not stick to the pan and just fall out.
Nothing stuck in the small cup that has to be dug out.
Much better than my old method in a muffin type tins.
I have used different pans and this is the only one I like.
I have purchased this pan as gifts for family members and also the owner of a restaurant in Keene, N.H.
who was complaining his popovers did not turn out right.
We all love and use this pan because it has air space around each section.
Perfect size for me...the larger size are really quite large!  It bakes perfectly and goes directly into the dishwasher.
I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys popovers.
This is about the 4th popover pan of this type that I've purchased.
It works fine and since I use it every Sunday, it seems to last a long time.
This is a nice size popover pan that ranges in the medium size.
I have nothing to do with Amazon or this company, this is a very good buy and a 5-star product.
Since Mini-Yorkshire puddings and popovers are basically cousins, they will both work in this pan.
With this pan you will obtain high, crisp, hollow popovers.If you need a great recipe, see the comments section for a URL.
I found a secret way to make the batter in a blender.
You will love making them in this pan, they "pop" right out because it is nonstick.~The Rebecca Review.
Make certain recipe instructions that are included with the pan are followed and you will have perfect popovers every time.
Popovers are a quick, low fat treat for breakfast or whenever.
Larger than I thought it would be and I couldn't be happier.
Popovers release easily from the pan and are nicely browned.
You will make the best popovers in this pan.
The pan is of great quality and browns your popovers perfectly.
This pan worked as stated in the description.
It did make very large cupcakes, but they may be too large for some tastes.
These are perfect - I particularly like to use the King Arthur brand of mix with this and they are perfect.
Sturdy, good sized, deeper than most.Suggest you drop oven temp.
at least five degrees and go from there.Cleans easily.Same size does not stack one into another.
I place my 8 inch round pan into the 9 inch pan...have two of each...and it works fine.
They're a good weight, the non-stick surface seems to be quite solid, and they just plain work.
(I've been very impressed with all my Chicago Metallic cooking equipment, actually.)One minor disadvantage is that they don't stack.
I've used this pan only a few times and it performed well.
Gave it four stars because like all nonsticks you have to be careful when removing foods to not scratch the interior.
Think I'll stick to anodized aluminum in the future.
But for a nonstick this one is very good--heavy, even browning and baking, good release, easy cleanup.
But I know when it (eventually) begins to peel--no matter how careful I am--it's in the trash.
Over the years I have used virtually every brand/size of cake pan.
I bought these back in 2007 and they are still the only cake pans I use.
They look brand new without any wearing of the finish.
I use them whenever I make a cake or similar.
It's heavyweight, nonstick surface is a breeze to wash and even a blueberry buckle coffeecake came out cleanly.
My only caution is that the rolled edge on top has some sharp edges and water will collect under the rim.
My remedy is to dry it right side up so water drains down the side of the pan.
These are the best! I bake focaccia loaves in these...perfect every time!!!Buy 'em now!!!We be droppin' 5 mojo*z on this perfect item!!!.
I grew up using my grandmother's cake pans and I still retain a deep fondness for them.
I've finally gotten that smooth, almost crumbless texture that is a joy to frost.
I'm sold on this bakeware and plan on getting more pans, which is the highest recommendation I can give.
I bake a lot and love this pan for baking loaves that require 8x4 pan.
However, because of the pan's folded metal construction, not unlike the Commercial Calphalon pans, crusts get stuck in the corners and are hard to clean.
It is otherwise a most excellent bread loaf pan.
These are well made and have stayed beautiful for several years.
I don't put them in the dishwasher, but the bread slides right out of the pans, so you don't need to scrub.
I have 4 of these, 6 2-pound, and the cake pans.
They are the perfect size for mini sweet breads and regular breads.
They make great mini sandwiches for my kids lunches.
I have used the Chicago Metallic Professional Nonstick 1-Pound Loaf pan several times now and each time my baked item has turned out just great.
Those instructions were included with the pan but were not emphasized and might easily have been missed.
When it comes to bread baking, this "Chicago Metallic Professional Nonstick 1-pound Loaf Pan" is the workhorse at our house.
At least one a week, and sometimes more.Rye bread.
Pretty much anything other that white bread has been made in this loaf pan.
And any that haven't turned out have been the baker's fault, not the pan's.I love that this is a solid, heavy-duty loaf pan.
But being heavy-duty doesn't mean it weighs a lot, and it is easy to use.
With a bit longer cooking time than for smaller muffins, this muffin pan cooked my jumbo muffins to perfection:  golden brown and evenly cooked throughout.
Plus, it was completely non-stick, so getting the muffins out of the pan--even sticky blueberry-packed ones--wasn't a problem, and clean up was a breeze.
My wife has been looking for a large muffin pan.
I love she does, cuz I get to eat the yummy muffins she makes using it.
It is heavy duty, made well, washes up great.
It's been so easy to make the large muffings I often purchased at the health club for a hefty sum and also at overpriced cafes'.
Now I have control over the content and cost.
Good quality and perfect for making individual pineapple upside down cakes.
We use this pan regularly and it still looks like new.
Love it! I was hesitant to not smear the thing with grease for added non-stick protection, but all turned out great.
If you love to bake, you will love this pan.
I have two different Baguette pans, this one and a non-stick non-perforated pan.
No more flat looking loaves that you get when you form the baton on the baking stone.Suggestions for perfect French bread:1.
Use a French bread pan, instead of placing the bread directly on the baking stone2.
Use a serrated knife sprayed with oil to cut the slashes in the bread3.
Place this pan on top of screaming hot (500 degree) baking stone4.
Mist the dough with water as soon as it is placed in the oven to get the oven spring5.
using these pans produces a loaf that is brown,crusty all around, with those little bumps you typically associate with commercial artisanal long loaves.
i use floured canvas to shape the loaves and to place them on the bread pan.
I have used it three times and each time like it more.
Way to go, Chicago! I am a baking pan snob and this does it all.
This pan is absolutely perfect for baking baguettes.
I enjoy baking bread - once you start making your own bread, the stuff from the supermarket just won't cut it.
I'm especially fond of hearty, crunchy loaves - a good solid crust is an art form.
Heavy construction, well made - feels like a quality piece (as do all of the Chicago Metallic pans I have).
If you are an amateur artisan bread baker, you've probably had the same problems I have had with shaping your loaves.
I would definitely recommend this pan to anyone who bakes bread at home.
One caveat - be sure to reduce your oven temperature by 25 degrees and cover the loaves with foil after 20 minutes to prevent burning.
I'd also watch and not use a wet dough since that might just stick in the holes.
I was hoping to make long and narrow baguettes.
This pan looks like it will make a wider loaf.
It is useful gadget for a bread lover.
The quality is nice and it does not bend or reform in a hot oven.
However I wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside.
It did exactly what we wanted it to do which was to provide a taller loaf than when using just a cookie sheet.
We spray the pan with oil before placing the loaves in the pan and have not had a sticking problem with 8+ loaves.
We use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise.
This works so much better than using a flat baking sheet for making french bread.
It is curved and it helps shape the loaf.
If you bake bread this is a MUST HAVE.
It will make your loaves really look professional out of the oven.
I wasn't sure when I placed this order, but I can say now that it was a great deal.
This pan is a pro and you'll be happy with the results it gives.Also an economical deal compared to other similar pan prices.
I'm a novice baker who vowed to learn the ins and outs of yeast bread when I retired from Information Technology--now there's a stretch.
I'm trying to decide on kneading in the KitchenAid vs.
kneading in the Cuisinart, vs kneading by hand.
I bought this French Bread Pan because I love the look and texture that you get on the bottom of store-bought loaves of sourdough.
The holes on the bottom allow the heat (and in some cases, steam) from the oven to circulate pretty evenly around the baking loaves.
Bread doesn't stick and you don't need anything special to clean these pans.
A few swipes with a clean, damp cloth, and these loaf pans are ready to be put away.
If there is any drawback to these pans, it's simply that they don't stack well.
But that's a small price to pay for the quality of the pan.
Another great product from one of my favorite kitchen ware companies.
While this makes great french bread, I love it for holding and helping shape soft loaves.
I did milk bread last night, and this helped the loaf stay in shape, not slide flat.
Makes perfectly shaped loaves, just like your local bakery.
I loved this pan the first time I used it.
The only thing is that the information that comes with it says to reduce the heat by 25 degrees.
The center of the loaf was SLIGHTLY undercooked.
And DO NOT let it rise on the pan...duh...some of the crust on the second loaf stuck into the tiny holes.
Remember to either spray it or use parchment when you place the loaves on.
If your dought isn't bone dry, you will be soaking and using a toothpick to get it clean for weeks.Great bread!.
I have used this bread pan several times to make french bread.
The bottom of the pan is perforated and does brown the bottom of the bread.
That is why I'm giving this product 5 stars.
I LOVE this pan! I bought this along with the baguette pan as I was getting frustrated with bread coming out flat.
The pans are easy to clean, and I have never had an issue with the dough getting stuck in the holes.
I always let my bread rise in an oiled bowl, so perhaps that helps.
I've made 3 batches of italian bread with this bread pan and it came out perfect everytime.
My bread wants to stick to the nonstick pan, but I line it with parchment paper and all is good.
I just received this pan the other day and already baked French Bread.
I originally bought this pan for myself but I liked it so much I've given them for gifts several times.
I like the way they bake the bread as well as the way they clean up.
Who ever did that should have clearly seen it was deformed and not packed it and retrieved different one for in the shipping carton.
Amazon had free shipping on my return also.The bread I bake with these pans is wonderful.
They come out perfect! The perforations in the pan are just the thing to get perfect texture on the loaf.
I recommend getting the "Cuisipro Stainless-Steel Spray Pump Non-Aerosol Mister" also with this pan.
Just make sure you don't use any sort of scouring pad to clean these (nylon pads are fine though).
This pan is fabulous for making French or Italian bread.
The loaves are perfectly shaped thanks to the curve of the pan and the bread develops a very nice crust due to the perforations.
I do spray the pans with cooking oil before baking.
She sent me a photo of two loaves of bread that she baked in this pan.
She was extremely happy with the results, as the bread baked evenly and the outside crust was nice and crisp.
Buy it if you want excellent baking results.
The few times I have used it so far it really helps the bread to cook all the way thru.
Do not have any problem getting the bread off the rack.
Also it takes up a lot less room in my oven than it would for two loafs on a sheet pan.
Bakes beautifilly rounded loaves evenly, all the way around.
I liked the first one I bought so much, I ordered a second one.
I love this pan! It is heavy in weight so I know it will last me a lifetime and cooks bread so nicely.
A must have in any kitchen for homemade breads.
The perforations allow the bread to develop a crisp, golden crust all over.
If you never though you could bake real artisan French bread from your own oven, get this pan AND the book!.
I have never had any problems using this pan.
The key is to use a recipe for French bread or baguettes, not just any bread recipe.
I use a bread machine dough cycle to prepare the dough, because I'm just not talented at breadmaking.
The French bread recipe in the machine's owner's manual worked fine, and so did a French bread recipe in a bread machine cookbook.
I think other doughs are too soft and get into the holes, as other reviewers have noted.
LOL  The Chicago Metallic baguette pan is easy to use and results in a crusty, chewy bread.
Great tool, if you like to bake your own baguettes this is GREAT!.
We use these pans daily, not only do they hold up well, they produce a beautiful product.
This was a Christmas present for my son who's taken an interest in baking.
This is a professional quality product and the price was reasonable.
The product met all of my expectations and I'm glad I purchased both the baguette and french bread pans.
I purchased this baguette pan along with its brother, the french bread pan.
Makes perfectly shaped loaves with nice crispy crust, just like your local bakery.
Would make a nice addition to anyones kitchen arsenal.
Sometimes it is hard to find fresh sourdough baguettes at a store or bakery on the weekend, so I learned to bake them.
After preparing the bread dough and dividing it into threes, I cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it overnight.
The next day, I place the room-temperature dough in a lightly oiled Chicago Metallic Professional Perforated Pan on a baking stone on my oven rack.
The baguette crust comes out crisp and the inside is chewy and moist.
Having tried a wonderful cheddar cheese baguette at a restuarant I made an attempt to duplicate those efforts.
Fortunately, my broiler pan was below with water for steam and caught the cheddar dripping from my baguettes.
I've been using this Chicago Metallic baguette pan for 5 years, and it is simple and very effective.
I use a standard 3-cup dough recipe that I develop in my bread machine, and this pan delivers great baguettes every time.
As previous reviews have suggested, don't neglect a spritz of non-stick spray before putting the dough on the pan to rise.
I have enjoyed Subway style sandwiches in the past and now with my own pans I am able to enjoy my own.
I used this pan once so far and have nothing but positive things to say about it.
This has to be my favorite pan for making the outside crust on the bread very crisp.
It seems that the heat flows better through this pan with the perforation.
While the pan is very sturdy and of a heavy gauge, it should provide you with wonderful bread in the years to come.
Be sure to give the pan a quick spray of non-stick spray before cooking, but you would do this when making any kind of bread.
If you are a bread maker and haven't given bagettes a try, this would be the idea pan to do this with.
I use this to make the Best Bread Ever by Charlie VanOver (baguettes using a food processor).
He recommends not putting it on the stone if using a convection oven.
If the dough gets stuck in the holes, your dough is way too wet.
I have been impressed with Chicago Metallic's baking equipment, so when it came time to get a baguette pan this was right where I went.
I have never had a problem with the loaf sticking to the pan, or any other problems for that matter.
I don't oil the surface as some have recommended, which has worked out just fine.
These sheets were recommended by Cooks magazine, and they are awesome.
Until I change my kitchen drawers with ikea parts, I am using these cookie sheets as liners.
I bought a couple of these cookie sheets a few years back.
I appreciate the design as I can put a lot of cookies on it or a braided bread, pizza, etc.
They have been accidentally dropped several times and no problem.
I've baked sour dough bread, baguettes, pretzels, and cookies with it.
The underside of the food was evenly cooked.
It does bend slightly while baking but will straighten itself out once cooled.Cleanup is easy.
This past Christmas, armed with every kitchen aid I could imagine, I baked several batches of Toll House chocolate chip cookies.
I made sure the baking sheet was cold, that the oven was the correct temperature and that the dough was properly chilled.
None-the-less, almost all the cookies were a little overdone on the bottom.
They do scratch easily, but that doesn't matter.
The small black spots are like chemical erosion, but I only use them for cookies & once in awhile fish products.
I think with the way quality goes these days, they may be the best on the market.
This cookie sheet is a great size and works very well.
I bought a couple of these from Amazon & absolutely love them.
They're made to last, a nice non-warping heavy-weight, designed with a small upward curve on the ends, which make for easy removal from the oven.
Plus I can bake more than a dozen at a time.
Which lowers the time required bake a batch of cookies.
They're a cookie bakers BEST friend, nice EVEN browning every time.
Only greased them for things like baking powder biscuits & they turned out beautifully.
If you enjoy baking cookies - I highly recommend these.
I've used many other types of baking sheets & had the best results with these.
A lot of folks who don't understand commercial products have left misleading feedback.This is a professional cookie sheet--no frills.
It's heavy enough not to warp but no heavier.
It's designed for a specific amount of browning.
Bakers who want less browning typically stack a pair of rimmed half sheet pans to create some insulation.
Yum.To the person who complained about food sticking: it's not non-stick.
If you're going to buy a professional product, do some research before complaining.
I've used these cookie sheets for over five years now.
We bake a lot of cookies in our house.
The cookies are rarely over or under done.
They also rarely stick.The sheets can warp a bit in a hotter oven, but that hasn't ever been a problem for us.The size is nice.
Big enough to put on sixteen plus cookies.
This matched up with a Chicago Metallic cooling rack is a great combo.
Our cookies really do come out better, and this pan never warps even though it is fairly thin.
Bent edges make grabbing it with oven mitts very easy.
These cookie sheets are made to last!  They are extremely heavy, and this larger commerical size is perfect for baking large batches of cookies.
These cookie sheets are solid, and can take plenty of use!  They do not rust, discolor, but always maintain their original shape.
If you make cookies on a regular basis, this cookie sheets would fit your needs.
That has been my concern and chief complaint every time I would bake anything.
Do not be fooled by the low price; these are a true bargain!.
This is a premier baking sheet at a fraction of the cost.
Made of commercial grade materials, it delivers quality nearly every time.
I have made many different foods on these sheets, including fish sticks, cookies, meats and roasted potatoes.
It works great with everyone, and there is no transfer ever.
I ran into this when I needed to visit a friend's home and do baking, and they didn't fit into her wall oven.
Not really Chicago Metallic's fault, just something to watch out for.
After a lifetime of nonstick baking sheets, I was persuaded to try this basic metal jelly roll pan with a parchment liner instead.
With the old nonstick sheets (of which I tried and discarded several brands over the years)the burn rate was more like 25-50%.
Ordered an additional one after first one arrived.
I agree about the glue used to adhere label.
Both pans ended up scratched because glue was overkill and extremly hard to remove.
After using non-stick for several years I decided to try one of these out after reading some of the reviews.
After my first one came in I bought two more.I've now had them for almost two years and they are holding up very well.
I use them for everything, from bread to cookies, chicken breast to hamburger patties.
Along with my silicone matt, clean up is fast and easy.
This is a product that I think will last for a long time.
We use a baking mat on top of it, and it's perfect for cookies and other baked items.
The item is substantial, and we had no problems taking the glue off.
I've only given this 4 stars, only because I haven't used it for everything it's designed for.
I have used it mostly for baking chicken pieces and roasting vegetables.
I'm amazed at the difference between other brands.
At one point I had 2 pans of chicken pieces in the oven - one Chicago Metallic, and the other a cheaper brand.
Not only was the Chicago Metallic easier to clean, but the chicken browned and cooked more evenly and was moist.
This is the first non stick baking sheet I have owned.
What a find !  The baking is even and quick.
I used parchment paper and had no problems with clean up.
The weight and color of the pan is wonderful and comes with a 25 year warranty on workmanship.
I bake everyday and anticipate no problems.As to the glue issue, there was a little on the pan but pulled up with little effort.
(I suppose the cold weather helped with this.)Happy Baking !.
Clear 3M Scotch tape) and stick the tape over the glue area and pull off to remove the glue.
Do this under good light so you can see the dullness of the adhesive layer on the surface.
Repeat as many times as necessary until the surface is uniform (no more trace of glue).
Give it a final soapy wash.If step 5 is not satisfactory, do step 4 then 5.
(Repeat as needed).My pan surfaces are pristine and I can't tell where the glue used to be.
This pan bakes evenly and doesn't scorch the bottoms of cookies, like most dark or nonstick baking sheets do.
There are times when you need a baking sheet that you don't have to worry about marring the non-stick coating while cutting (e.g pizza).
I purchased three of these pans to aide my cookie baking adventures for the holiday season.
They are firm, sturdy, and are very nice quality.
These are not non-stick pans, but they do quite well.
The high quality of the metal in these pans enables the pan to have even heat distribution with no hot spots.
I have used these for cookie making, candied nuts, and to help me get stuff off of the grill.
I love these pans, not the cheapest pan, but these will not let you down.
From spreading fruits (blueberries) for freezing to baking cookies or pizza.
They are now 8 years old and have held up very well.
Limited scratching from cutting pizzas, but doesn't impair cooking other things.
However, even with using a scrubbie, Cameo metal cleaner and then Goo Gone, it took almost an hour to get all of the glue off.
They main selling point was their "no-stick" coating.
These pans are heavy gauge aluminum - HEAVY.
They retain their shape and they spread the heat evenly.
NO hot spots!  They are heavy gauge aluminum - HEAVY.
They don't burn which means they clean up easily (remember the PAM thing).
There is no funky coating to flake off down the road.
The sides are actually strait for good cake making.
Perfect depth, excellent cake surface, and wonderful heat distribution.
We use these in my bakery/cafe and they are strong, durable and cook evenly.
They will last a home cook forever and us for years to come.
I love all of my products from Chicago Metallic.
They perform well, don't warp and clean easily.
I have been replacing all of my non stick bakeware and the commercial line from Chicago Metallic is excellent.
Clumsy and break glass dishes often? Forget Pyrex pie pans, get these instead!!!Nicely browned and flaky crust pies you'd absolutely get.
Durable and easy to clean you'd definitely save money and time.A Must Have Pie Pans !!!.
We tried these for Thanksgiving and the crusts came out very consistent.
I made one pie a long time ago in college, so I'm calling the pies I made recently with these pans my 1st "real" pies.
I found these pans to be incredible!  I made four pumpkin/pecan pies over Thanksgiving, and I couldn't have wanted a better quality pan.
I love the perforations in the bottom of the pans and am sure that's why the crust was so flaky and evenly baked to perfection.
I actually want to buy two more so I can be preparing two pies while two are baking.
I have many pieces from the Chicago Metallic line and am very happy with all of them.
milkPut all ingredients into a 9 inch pie pan.
Mix with a fork until well blended and pat into the pan.
Push the pastry up the sides and form a nice edge with your thumb and finger.
Use PAM or a baking spray with flour on it.
I havent tried it with cooking oil or parchment yet.
But, like anything with wholes in it if the crust isnt dried and floured, it's gonna sag thru the holes.
I'm going to buy some of those silicon baking sheets for it.
The perforations in the bottom help the cust to brown more evenly.
When making pies from very juicy fruits, a non-perforated pan will cause the crust to be soggy.
And, these are great pans:  a nice size and a good thickness.
I love them, and am ordering more since I've given away to friends the two I had.
Prick the crust with a fork, and bake crust alone at 400 degrees until browned (about 10 minutes).Slice 5 ripe pears and arrange in crust.
In a plastic quart-size bag, knead 1/3 cup butter, 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup suger, and about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon until it is crumbly.
This loaf pan is heavy weight and very durable.
Anything that you bake in it browns evenly not to mention easy release when you bake bread.
I have a lot of loaf pans but this out does them all.
It's heavy duty, cleans up nice, and cooks evenly.
It gets darker the more you use it.
I had forgotten that it was bright and shiny when I first received it.
Yes, I know that using it as mold for freezer food is not the original intention, I'm just saying there are options.
;o)The main intention obviously is baking bread, and it really does do a great job.
I also have heavy duty af shaped as a cover for the top.
Remembered that I needed to do a review.
All of my reviews on the Chicago Metallic bakeware are going to look much the same.
They all have nooks and crannies that are difficult to keep clean.But, boy this stuff can cook.
You can simply feel the top quality of these pans.
Best pans you'll even own.Great for Challa, and any type of bread.
This top quality, commercial grade loaf pan delivers on its promise.
The coating creates a quick release crust that does not equate with dryness, only deliciousness.
Please keep in mind that this is a specialty item expressly designed for baked goods and not meatloaf.
This Chicago Metallic is the best at its intended use, turning out best quality bread loaves, pound cakes and other breads of every description.
I kept putting it back on, and it seems to stay on now when I use it.
Awesome pan, very heavy duty, lid is also great.
Makes a great gift or addition to any kitchen.
This is a handy duo!  The pan as usual is sturdy and the lid well, don't know what it's made of but very flexible.
The lid has a slight dome to it so it doesn't mash the contents when opening.Again, follow instructions on cook time, oven temp.
I cannot wait for a family or neighborhood gathering where I can show this off !!  This was another great addition to my collection.
This pan was exactly what I needed for brownies and other baked items, but the lid is essentially useless.
For the money, the pan is still a decent bargain.
I bought this as a gift for someone who wanted one.
I did not read carefully and it is a bit smaller that I expected but fits a steak or a couple of burgers.
She says it is well made and cleans easily.
Helps me use my toaster oven more and my full size oven less.
Great for cooking small quantities for 1 or 2 people.
I use my toaster oven all the time and this little pan helps with warming up a few servings of just about anything.
Broiler pan comes in handy too for frozen wings or most little things you do not want to start the big broiler for.
I bought this pan set to use with my new Cuisinart toaster oven.
I've use it several times and I am quite happy with it's performance.
I intend on purchasing another one.Regarding it's size, even knowing the stated measurements beforehand, for some reason it still seemed smaller than I anticipated.
Or maybe it's that I am not used to toaster oven size pans.
The size is fine for me as I generally just cook for myself.
However, fitting large portions on it would be a problem.
Two pork chops is all you are going to fit on it.
Large and sturdy - doesn't bend under the weight no matter how much I put on it.
I wanted a rack big enough to handle my giant cookies.
The vent holes are small so I don't have to worry about hot, soft cookies bending or breaking.
No more waiting, and waiting for cakes to cool to frost them.
The grids are spaced close enough together so cookies do not fall through.
Its great to have a big rack to fit lots of cookies.
It also has the added advantage of small mesh so things do'nt fall through.
This grid, placed over a sheet pan, is perfect for draining/cooling fried foods,cookies, etc.
-- watch Alton Brown to see what I mean.
I've even used it to support a roast in a 350 degree oven with good results.
I needed something bigger than your usual cooling rack as I do 3 or four loaves at a time.
This was reasonably priced and looks like it will last forever.
I think it was a pretty good buy.
3 times heavier than anything around for just a little bit more.
Unfortunately, they do not fit the Chicago Mettalic half sheet pans.
They still work fine but that caused me to give one less star.
You would think that Chicago Metallic would make these to fit the sheet pans.
i love these racks!  as someone who is not a fan of non-stick products, I am so happy these racks exist.
non-stick is not even healthy, but back to the product.
these are well made, do the job, and clean up nicely.
i am a frequent baker and they certainly come in handy.
all of my bakeware is chicago metallic and i am very happy with their products.
This unit has a loud buzzer that alerts you when they're done (or when the time is up).
We've had this very egg head for 5 years and we adore it.
Yes it does wake the dead and kinda glad to see that our old machine is still made with that same buzzer.
We only hard cook and on occasion softer cook eggs.
Don't try to use the poach egged methods.
Otherwise we adore it and make that I adore it.
What a delight and yes wakeup call to your nervous system....go for it!.
If you like hard boiled eggs (and who doesn't :-) this is IT!Easy to use, consistent, perfect eggs every time.
I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
Sure the buzzer is loud, but not any louder than a clothes dryer buzzer.I'm so glad I bought this.
That is over 250 uses and still going strong.
as far as steam is concerned, of course it produces steam!  It is a cooking unit that produces boiling water.
I'm a fairly serious cook, so I need to measure a lot.
A beaker, you say?  But once you use it -- you'll never go back.
Ever.I measure things and then shake to mix.
Great for drinks, but also especially for cooking.
Alton Brown on the TV Show Good Eats uses a similar one (not sure if they are the same).
It has some classy looks going on too -- nice as well as functional.
I have had this item since 2007 and still use it weekly.
Works great for people who cook a lot.
I have always hand washed it since it is so small.
None of the markings have work off and it has not cracked anywhere.
Only irritations are the hollow bottom collects water when upside down to dry and it is quite scratched.
Still fantastic for adding TBS to a cup which is often something I have to do baking at high altitude.
This is the most handy measuring unit I've owned.
Measurements are clearly marked for teaspoons, ml/ccm, pint units, cups, tablespoons, and ounces.
The beaker's design is sturdy and it's deep enough to securely hold a long thermometer.If you're into cooking and baking, this beaker is a must.
I bought this in 2004 and although I use it still, I really need to order a new one.
It has many small cracks in the plastic now and some of the markings are really hard to see.
It also has a few chips off the rim.
I love how it works and its my favorite measuring device, but the plastic is a bit brittle.
It started cracking a bit after a couple of years.
Considering I still use it now after 10 years, I guess it held up fine considering that.
Just looks really bad.The lid died very shortly after purchasing though.
I bought this one because most of the recipes I do are in CC and in America people don't use that much.
Despite my skepticism, this item is great and works beautifully.
It is not difficult to clean as I had expected it would be.
As a former chemist, among other things, I really appreciate this measuring cup as the very best improvement over the old pyrex glass cups.
There are really good reasons to do solids with the stainless steel spoons and cups.
I was a bit skeptical of the practicality of this.
I've used the glass Pyrex measuring "cups" but I've found that they are not always so precise.
Sometimes the measuring marks are even printed off kilter.
This "perfect beaker" however is much more accurate and I've come to like it quite a bit.
Because it is so narrow near the base, it is much more precise for measuring smaller amounts.
I'm not really sure what the practicality of the lid is.
I've never stored anything in this, only for measuring liquids.
Also helpful is that there are multiple measurements, including cups, ounces, tablespoons, milliliters, et cetera.
This sat on my shelf for a long time.
I originally bought it to bake German recipes from my mother's old recipes.
Then, I bought a scale, which solved that problem.
One day, I grabbed it while making margaritas.
I liked being able to measure cups and ounces so easily.
Now, this has become my go-to measuring cup when working with liquids.
I don't wash it in the dishwasher, finding that hand washing works just as well.
The material is very easy to see measurements on though and for me that's the most important thing.
So far I'm very pleased with this purchase.
If you're like me, and need to use alot of measuring implements, then this is the one for you.
I love it!!! I love it so much I bought 2!The cover is great, too.
It keeps everything fresh and in one place until you need it.
Odd how a measuring cup (or as it is called a beaker) can be so different and pleasing.
This one is!  It is so much better than our Pyrex measuring cups.
It's ideal for those recipes that combine measures, e.g., "one cup plus two tablespoons of sugar".
The design is attractive enough to leave on the counter, and the acrylic material also makes it lightweight.
I was just praising whoever designed it in my review of "The Design of Things to Come" by Craig M.
Vogel, Jonathan Cagan and Peter Boatwright because the Perfect Beaker transforms a typical cooking utensil into an ideal combination of aesthetics and function.
I've used mine almost daily for 10 years; it makes a noticeable improvement in convenience.
I only wish the plastic hadn't started to craze after about 3 years.
It doesn't seem to have affected performance so far, but it probably will in another 10 years.
I do not put it in the dishwasher so I cannot speak for those that do.
Bought it because Alton Brown used it on his show.
Seems like it would melt in the dishwasher.
This is a great tool for measuring liquid ingredients.
Since I do a lot of cooking and baking I find myself using it a lot.
I am able to pour boiling hot water into it without any problems.
It is best to not use it to measure oils since you tend to leave some behind.
Also I find the lid that comes with it to be pretty much pointless.
I just leave it sitting in a drawer and have not used it once since I purchased the beaker.
My major problem with this is that over the years cracks have begun to develop along the bottom and sides of my container.
It hasn't caused any leaks but I am sure I will need to buy a new one eventually.
Until then it still serves it purpose well.
But I do agree with a past reviewer that it would be great if they made one of these out of glass.
What's nice about it is you have a lot of different measurements in one place.
Plus I've found it to be very accurate.
It measures CUPS, OZ, TBSP, TSP, ML/CCM/, and PINT.
I do wish it were glass instead of plastic.
It is graduated for practically any measurement you're likely to use and several you probably won't.
The fact that this beaker has so many different measuring scales makes it one of the most useful measuring cups in my cabinet.
The one thing I dislike about it is that the base fills with water in the dishwasher.
Surely they could have altered the design to keep that from happening.
I don't use these beakers much in my cooking but I had a gut feeling I'd need this and on Thanksgiving, I did.
It's plastic but does feel quite durable and is made in Germany.
I've had one of these for over 10 years; and not too long ago it got a thin stress crack in it.
Not bad at all for all the bounces and crashes in the sink and dishwasher.
The wide variety of scales (ounces, cups, metric, etc) and a variety of fractions for cups, comes in quite handy.
And the markings are just as visible after 10 years, unlike Tupperware measuring pitchers.
And if you don't you should try it.
It makes measuring so much easier than traditional cups.
The reason I like this is it has the potential of not needing to use multiple measuring tools in one kitchen session.
Around the beaker are many units of measurements.
It is small at the bottom but the base is very stable.This beaker is made of light and thin plastic.
Unfortunately, the lid seems to be flimsy and cheaply made.I like the versatility and usefulness of this beaker.
I bake a lot and find that I'm reaching for this measuring cup all the time.
I can actually SEE the numbers and it feels good in your hand - you can get a good grip on it.
I am a avid gardener and from time to time I find the need to spray pests on my lawn or shrubs.
The trouble is, there are rarely measurements on the bottle so that one can dispense the correct amount of product per gallon.
You can easily and concisely measure the product that you need with no hassle.
The cone shape really helps to get an accurate measurement for small quantities.
I like it so well I am going to have to buy a couple more.
This arrived in a timely manner, packaged well.
It was a tad more light-weight that I thought it would be however, it has measurements for anything I could ever want.
I use it a great deal of the time and will get another one soon.
In fact, owning more than one may be ideal!The way I prefer to rate it:  Five stars on usability and usefulness.
It's gone through a lot of use, abuse, and just about lives in the dishwasher.
Can measure up to two cups.Cons: It doesn't have a pouring spout for liquids (although it hasn't been a severe problem with me).
The hollow base fills with dirty dishwasher water when clean in the dishwasher (but it cleans out quickly).
The only reason we give this product four out of five stars is because it is made of plastic rather than pyrex.
The graduated  measurements make it extremely easy to read and to fill.
It is very well balanced and doesn't tip over when liquid is poured into it, which was a fear of mine when I bought it.
Beside my OXO Angled Measuring Jigger, my Emsa Perfect Beaker Measuring Beaker is probably the most-used tool in my bar.
I bounght mine six years ago in 2007.
But the Perfect Beaker just keeps steaming along.
It's tough: The markings are still perfectly readable and unfaded after six years, even with a lot of trips through the dishwasher.Good stuff!.
The perfect beaker is indeed the perfect way to measure out all you dry or wet ingredients.
I picked it up after watching a rerun of Alton Brown.
I used it to quickly measure some stuff for Xmas cooking.
Have hand washed it after reading other reviews of the markings wiping off.
I will keep you posted if it comes off.
It fits snugly and works well for salad dressings.
Plastic also seems to hang on to fats and oils more tenaciously than does glass or metal, so that clean up is a bit harder.
Still, it's light, easy to use and doesn't take up much space in the cabinet.
I can live with a few scuffs and a little extra dishwashing liquid for clean-up.
Try it; you'll love it.[Edited to add:  I have to concur with the reviewer who wished this beaker was made from Pyrex.
Though it would be substantially heavier, I might still have it.
Scuffed and weakened by constant use, it finally cracked when I used it to measure hot (not boiling) water.
I will get another, but because I'll have to be more cautious with it, I'm not as wholly sold on it as I once was.
No points taken away, though; it's still a great idea.].
And I use this one quite frequently for measuring liquids.
It's light weight, easy to hold onto, and is an accurate measure.
It doesn't have a pour spout, but liquid seems to pour out of it just fine without dripping down the sides.
It's also handy for add-ons when measuring by weight; because of the small footprint, it fits well on my small kitchen scale.
The basket is great quality and works perfectly for 500 gram (dry) flour batch sizes or smaller.
Basically, 500 grams is the amount of dry flour used in a typical &#34;loaf pan&#34; for bread.
If you are baking larger loaves then you'll want a bigger proofing basket.
Fun to use!!!  I got rave reviews about the  bread I poofed in this.
I purchased several of these bread forms for my daughter's birthday at her request.
She really likes this kind of form and now owns several.
She's an experienced baker and bakes several times a week.
She is otherwise quite happy with the forms.
They're really sturdy and should last her the rest of her life.
This is the largest brotform I've ever used.
I've used theKasskonnen Brotform 9 inch Ovalfor a long time, but this 8" round brotform is much bigger.
I had mixed results when I first used this brotform.
The first batch was a nice medium sized loaf, but I only filled a fraction of the brotform with dough.
After baking, the loaf came out to the size of a layer cake.
The loaf that large didn't really retain its round form either.
It was still beautiful though.If you've never used a brotform, try your best to keep it dry.
Then dump that flour out into the trash and feel around to see if it feels smooth all around.
Then apply more flour before you add the dough.
I've had my best results since I stopped washing my brotforms.
I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she's been baking bread ever since.
I've put photos of her finished product on Facebook and it looks (and tastes) as good as the finest artisian bread.
The brotform gives the bread the contoured look of a professional product.
I love the design it give my bread, It shapes the bread nicely and helps the bread rise beautifully.
The brotform is very useful with the soft doughs created by "no knead" bread recipes.
It encourages the dough to rise higher than it would if it were just left on a flat surface.
Check the internet for tips on flowering or otherwise lining the basket before use.
After my first try, I got the knack of it and am pleased with the results.
It is also great with regular kneaded doughs.
This is a high quality basket at a very good price.
I wish I had enough experience to know this would require 2 loaves at a time to fill the basket.
I see now I could have bought a smaller one.
Anyway it does nice job of patterning the bread so I seem like a pro baker to my family and friends.
This always makes me smile since I am only an amateur.
My husband is the cook and makes a fresh artisan bread load everyday.
This basket was the perfect gift for him!.
What a total pain it was to clean.
Bought the Melitta based upon Amazon reviews as I really wanted something easier to clean.
Various plastic bits broke during the first year and I got 2-3 replacement parts under warranty.
Post warranty everything has held up fine so far.
I would buy another as I've been very happy with the coffee from the Melitta.
This is the best coffee pot in the world.
I have owned two, and like everyone else has mentioned, always push the button to open and close the grinder area.
If you can do that, the coffee pot will last forever.
I also love the ease of cleaning, you just rinse one area of wet grinds down the sink.
Little hint...put press and seal over the hole in the back and you can fill it more.
A few tips for use:~To make cleaning as pain-free as possible, empty the grinds basket as soon as it cools down, or shortly thereafter.
Basically, I just rinse all the parts well and they do just fine.
I was surprised to see how small this unit is compared to other grind and brew coffee makers I've had.
I did notice that you need to put in at least one extra cup of water to get the number of cups you really want.
It loses at least a cup in brewing.
I only gave it four stars because 1.
it's a 10 cup not a 12 cup 2.
Considering the price of this unit, it's a great buy!.
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one.
at last minute found this and read reviews.
have had success in past w/ this brand.
had this nearly a year and really really like it.
Our first coffee maker was a Krups that lasted 14 years.
Naturally, we replaced it with another Krups but were disappointed with the quality upon opening it and seeing how thinly made the glass carafe was.
Perhaps we've had it about a year now.
We chose this after reading that the Cuisinart was loud and difficult to clean.
This coffee maker is easy to clean and the glass carafe is sturdy.
We regularly use the timer and grinder and like this coffee maker very much.
We'd gladly recommend this as we get tired of grinding coffee separately.
A true coffee snob would never use a drip Coffeemaker.
Here's what's great about this pot:Built in Grinder: Coffee is ground fresh in the morning for the best brew.
Also, you don't spill grounds on the kitchen counter.
Put your old grinder in the basement.Simple design: My 9 year old makes the coffee now.
Easy to clean, takes up no more space on the counter.
The Cuisinart looks like a plumbing nightmare compared to this.(And its HUGE.)Pours without spilling: I loved my old Mr.
I'm on my third or fourth one of these, can't remember.
Just treat it ever so gently when cleaning, handling and re-assembling its plastic parts.
I purchased this coffee maker from Amazon and was very pleased with the operation and quality of the coffee that it produced.
After closely reading the maintenance section of the instructions, I find that the carafee, grinder and grounds holder should not be cleaned in the dishwasher.
That put an abrupt end to my liking this instrument.
These brewing parts are a pain to clean.
I returned the whole maker to Amazon and received a full purchase price refund including shipping.
Have used the Melitta Mill-N-Brew for 9 months now and have enjoyed the great coffee from fresh beans.
You can set the grind...I like the #2 setting.
The coffee is so good that I have to make 2 pots each morning.Unfortunately, I have to go buy another Mill-N-Brew today.
A little plastic tab on the cover of the bean compartment broke off and the cover will not latch.
Have not been able to buy just the part.
(Based on those reviews I bought this coffee maker 2 weeks ago).
Interesting....This coffee maker makes a good cup of coffee, but not if you use the quantity of beans they suggest in the manual.
I agree with other readers that paper filter machines make a better cup of coffee, but the difference is not huge.
Filters will not work in this coffee maker, as the grinder blades are sitting in the drip basket.
I would like this machine a lot better with a thermal, not glass carafe.
Its not a big issue for me 'though.
so if you like to brew less, you should probably get the Melitta ME2TMB, but that one  does not have a mill.
The ease and convenience of this  Melitta MEMB1B Mill & Brew make it a great buy.
I had been looking a different self contained coffee makers and was hesitant to purchase one.
I'd read that some were difficult to clean.
Melitta as a manufacturer has always been about coffee, so when this product came up in my gold box offering, I took the plunge.
It is not difficult to clean or assemble.
The only change I'd make is a slight one.
A slight adjustment by the manufacturer could easily correct this and there are plenty of ways to remedy that slight oversight.
It's certainly not enough to rate this product less than 5 stars.
I get rave reviews on the coffe this machine produces.
Without the paper filters, you get a more flavorful cup.
Fill the basket with coffee beans, the resevoir with water , set the timer and wake up to fresh hot coffee every morning.
Quiet grinder does not wake you before your alarm clock.
Bought the BLACK Melitta Mill & Brew over a year ago (actually longer, but, I can't find my order info.
in my Inbox) and it's still the best coffeemaker we've ever bought.
So, Melitta--what's up?  Our daughter wants one and it seems it's no longer available and I can't find a replacement.
If anyone knows, please reply to this review.P.S.
I also let the filter cup "fall" into place when I put it back in.
The markings are NOT accurate according to most coffee mugs.
Maybe the markings are based on 6 ounce "cups" of coffee--which no one uses.
I also made a "personal measurement" strip of tape with freezer tape and taped it "up" the side of the caraffe.
It has held through many, many washings of the pot until recently.
I guess in 2011 I'll have to make a new strip.
:-)  Little trouble I would say for a great cup(mug!) of coffee every morning.RE:  capacityMaybe capacity is another slight "con".
If you have several people over for coffee you'll need to make one pot and put into a thermal pot and then make another pot.
The caraffe only makes about 6-8 mugs/cups--depending on the size of the cup.
Some coffeemakers make 12; this one doesn't.So, Melitta--bring it on!  I have another sale for you!.
The world of grind and brew coffeemakers is a crapshoot - I had a Cuisinart Grind and Brew and had nothing but problems.
This coffeemaker is great, small, quiet, and makes great coffee! I only have one complaint - the coffee is never really &quot;hot&quot;.
And I'm very sensitive to hot coffee - I can't even pretend to start drinking a hot cup of joe from Caribou.
But from this, the coffee is never really steaming, never really hot.
So it's drinkable right away, but if you don't drink your mug within about 10 minutes, it's cold.
Long ago, I had a Toshiba grind/brew machine.
It was great, but sounded like a chainsaw when the grinder went off.
I went through several Brauns, Krups, and a Cuisinart, and with a couple of burr grinders on the side.
I wanted the convenience of putting the grinder into the coffee maker.
I don't think there was one positive review.
I examined it in some local stores, and did some price checking.
I ordered from Amazon (best price and free shipping).
This is a great machine, easy to use, and it makes great coffee.
As another reviewer pointed out, it does not have an adjustable heating plate.
However, that is not an issue for me, since I always move the coffee into an insulated carafe.
When you add in the great price here at Amazon, this is a five-star winner.
This Melitta is the best! After two Cuisinart's - one of which was replaced under warranty three times - I am delighted with the Melitta.
I have owned this pot for 3 years now and it still works great.
I owned a Cuisinart grind and brew and thought it was terrific.
That was until it broke (in it's defense it lasted 3 years) and I ordered this Melitta Coffee Maker.
This is absolutely the best coffee I have tasted.
Thanks Melitta for making a first rate appliance at a great price!!!.
If it doesn't close easily, take out the basket, manually spin the knob on the bottom a few times, re-insert, and try again.
If you stick to this procedure it'll last a very, very long time and you'll avoid the only problem with this otherwise-spectacular product.
It does the job; it grinds the beans and brews coffee.
But there is a couple of things they can improve.1.
When it grinds the bean, the coffee powder sticks to the lid and the top edge of the basket.
The measuring marks on the canister and the water tank don't match.
3 Cups in the canister is only 2 cups in the water tank.
I tried to use it as a coffee grinder for my Espresso machine.
Even though the basket was completely dry, some powder still stuck in the bottom.
The grinding/brewing basket is a metal mesh so no more paper filters to buy.
Also, a fair bit of steam comes out of the top of the (rather tall) unit.
So if you are planning to put this on a counter under a cabinet you might want to rethink the location.
This is my first maker ever and I read all the reviews on Amazon which pointed to this one being best.
I found that the grinds don't seem to be there when placed on setting 7 and overall I am really happy with it.
If you are looking for a mill/brew I think this is the best.
It makes very good coffee and the grinding/programming functions are easy to understand and use.
I first reviewed this 2 years ago, and gave it 5 stars.
Now my great review is not so amazing.
After the first one broke I thought it was my fault, slamming the lid, etc.
Bought the second and was VERY CAREFUL, yet same problem.
Read on.I have had 2 of these coffee makers and am now in the market for a third, however, this time I may look elsewhere.
Problem is the part that breaks cannot be fixed.
with repeated everyday use, the small plastic latch piece that keeps the top, which covers the coffee basket, secure, will break off due to stress.
This even happens if you are very careful and press the button down first, so that the latch does not click into place.
Once this is broken, the lid will not stay closed, so the coffee will not brew, and the machine is pretty much useless.
You can tape it down every time, but that is a pain.
Melitta needs to address this issue and put a sturdier latching mechanism on the machine.
This is why it is a two star out of 5.
I am personally not into spending 60 dollars every year or so for a new machine.
The only reason I bought 2 is because I don't know who else who sells a similar machine at a reasonable price.
I bought this when my noisy and messy Cuisinart Grind & Brew stopped grinding and brewing.
It no longer sounds like an F16 taking off in my kitchen! You can't even hear it two rooms away.
There are fewer parts to clean each time (5 compared to 7).
I end up using one scoop to every four cups of water instead of one scoop to every six.
I will miss this one greatly when my new one breaks.
I ditched my leaky Michael Graves coffee maker and stepped up to get this little Melitta number.
It's the best decision I've made in months.
Most mill and brew makers are way out of the average budget, but this one is both reasonably priced and easy to use.
This is a great coffee maker for the money!  The features I like best are the adjustable grinder and timer.
Also, I don't have to worry about leaving it on in the mornings.
Make your mornings happier with this excellent coffee bargain!.
THIS IS AN AWESOME COFFEE MAKER, PLUS NO OTHER COMPANY MAKES A MILL AND BREW THAT DOES NOT REQIRE FILTERS.
EASY TO CLEAN, AWESOME COFFEE, GREAT QUALITY !!!  THIS IS THE SECOND MACHINE WE OWN, EXTREMLY HAPPY WITH MELITTA.
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT COFFEE MAKER, THIS IS THE BEST THERE IS.
Is that why I can't buy any this Christmas?.
Very happy with this product -- my first ever Melitaa appliance.
I have had it for only 3 weeks, and so far it appears pretty sturdy.
If you like the grind and brew, this is the best one for the money.
It's easy to clean, doesn't hog too much counter space and is easy to program.
I gave it four stars because I like really stong coffee (Turkish) and there is no slow brew option.
I had the original Cuisinart pot, which was painfully loud and had too many parts to clean.
For those who like strong coffee, you'll have to use extra beans.
I've had this coffeemaker for a month now, and I'm very pleased.
The instructions are not the most clear ones I've ever seen.
But once you get the hang of it, it's just lovely.
And I've never had a better cup of coffee made at home.Recommended.
The grinder works well--certainly as well as these ubiquitous stand-up press-the-top grinders.
This has been an excellent coffeemaker so far.
Far more features than you would expect at this price.
Wonderful value.ConsThe water fill slot is a little small and takes a steady hand.
I find that one scoop of beans is good for 1-1.5 cups of coffee, not 1 scoop per 2 as the instructions say.
My old coffee maker required a quick microwaving of the coffee to get it warm enough.
Now that I have a timer, I've never used it.
I was amused because I use a plastic cup specially modified to fit in this same space.
Plus, its' sleak appearance and not-too-big size fits right into our kitchen decor.
No big time displays - just a great cup of coffee every time.
Can't recommend this highly enough!  Just remember that the timer won't set until the coffee bean cover is closed (the book doesn't mention this).
We had NONE of the problems mentioned in the other reviews.
Features: 5 of 5 starsFunction: 5Form: 5Cust Svc: 5Quality/durability: 3I bought the MEMB1B.
At the time I think I could only find one other brand with the same combination of features.
I really like all the features, functionality and form factor of this model.
Every pot of coffee is consistent after finding the right balance of grinding time, beans and water.
This required sending the entire unit back to Salton/Melitta and they shipped me a brand new replacement.
I really love having this coffee maker, but even at the current.
price, I'd have to caution others to shop around and inspect other brand units for durability before making a decision to purchase.
A solid four stars and a good value for the price.
The mesh on the basket also tore after about 2 years.
It makes a good cup of fresh coffee and is easy to clean.
I wish the auto turnoff timer could be adjusted, as I don't always want it to turn off after just one hour.
This is a better machine for the price than the Cuisenart, I just wish it didn't have so many parts break so quicklly.
I purchased this item for a Christmas gift for 2006.
Quite useful coffeemaker, much loved in the house!.
When my KRUPS breaks, I will replace with the Melitta and hopefully their white model will be cheaper.
This combo coffee maker and mill is super! It is much more convenient and definitely less messy than the separate units.
My husband swears that the coffee tastes better! Thanks for this wonderful product.
You will want to use AT LEAST 1.5 scoops per 2 cups of coffee, and some will want 1 scoop per cup.
Cleaning the device after each use takes as much time as grinding the beans yourself.
Product includes permanent filter.3) Timer function is easy to use.4) Grinder is not quiet, but not too loud either.
It's just right.5) Grinding function has 7 levels of grounds, choose the fineness you want.6) Coffee brews very quickly.
The other brands -- Krups, Capresso and Cuisinart -- get dismal reviews.
You know they are bad when they start appearing at your local supermarket at cut-rate prices (that's where I've seen the Krups!)This product works.Enjoy!.
We've had the Melitta for about 6 months.
Prior to this we had a grinder and a standard machine, and never got around to pulling out the grinder much.
The machine is easy to clean and takes up little space.
Sure, it's harder to clean than paper filters, but that's to be expected.
It's by no means difficult--just rinse under running water.
There is a round black lid that fits directly on top of the filter which holds the beans.
Not the one attached to the coffee maker; the removable one that has a hole in the top for the water to run through.
We cut the center of a standard coffee filter out and put it on top of that lid.
All the convenience of a regular coffee maker with the taste and flexibility of using whole beans.
this is the best coffee maker that I have ever used.
It grinds the beans perfectly, makes great coffee and is very easy to clean.
Believe me, I have used them all and this is the one I am staying with.
I use Breadman in testing bread recipes that go into cookbooks and have a test kitchen lined up with all models.
Only once about 6 years ago did one breakdown and Salton replaced it quickly (it was within warranty).
We've used many different brands and Breadman takes all honors.
I've owned my Breadman Ultimate for 6 years now.
It's my 3rd bread machine and by far the best.
I recently thought I had burned out the motor after the machine overheated trying to knead a very heavy whole grain sourdough.
However, after not working for 2 days, my machine is making perfect bread once again.
I have no complaints at all about the machine.
The reasons are probably petty sounding, but here goes:It holds too much moisture; therefore it's not well vented.
The glass window, which is way too small, fogs up, so you really can't keep an eye on the bread during parts of the process.
This is a design flaw, and there's no excuse for it.If you deviate in the least from the recipes supplied, you'll get an inedible loaf.
(I have a suggestion for that...see below the carping complaints).The machine is tall.
My last machine had indented grips for that purpose.
I store the machine in a cupboard, so I must move it each time it's used.
You really must not open it during a large part of operation or the bread will possibly fall.
All bread machines are NOT like that.It's a pain in the butt to clean, and I consider the removable door to be very flimsy.
Another design flaw that didn't have to be.
You must remove the door to clean the machine really properly.Oh, enough.It has some good points.
It makes several sizes of loaf, good for single people or families.It doesn't hog great gobs of electricity.It's not ugly.
That matters if your kitchen is large enough to have all your toys out for the sake of convenience.
The outer part is simple to wipe down.It doesn't weigh a ton if you need to move it.It's relatively cheap.
If you deviate from the exact recipe, for example, substituting honey/molasses for sugar, MAKE SURE you get the liquid/dry ingredient ratio right.
Use I tablespoon of liquid sweetening agent...REDUCE water/milk by one tablespoon.
The secret of most baking is following the directions very precisely.
OH, for the novice...PLEASE believe that the weather, in terms of humidity, or extreme heat/cold will affect the bread baking process.
It's easier to wait for a dry day, than to try to "adjust" the dough for the weather.And that's that!.
At the discount price we bought our machine at (around one hundred bucks), this is the best bread maker value on the market.
If you use it to make dough for pizza, rolls, cinnamon buns, etc.
This is the second bread machine that I have ever owned, the first being a '92 model that is long since discontinued.
I make 1 - 2 loaves of wheat bread every week from scratch and occasionally I use the pizza dough cycle.
My family rarely tolerates anything more exotic than that!  I have also tested this machine with boxed mixes.
So far, this bread machine has been an excellent producer of consistent, high-quality bread.
However, this is not the major problem that some have made it out to be.
I would advise anybody with noise sensitivity to place this breadmaker in a room with a closed door during operation.-Andrea, aka Merribelle.
I have used an Oster 5838 machine from 1996 until the shaft in the pan broke last month.
A replacement pan was $22 from Sunbeam, so I figured I would upgrade to a new breadmaker instead.
I have had the Breadman TR2200C for about 4 weeks now and I think I like this breadmaker.
The paddle is more "aggressive" in its shape, and also spins alternately in both directions.
I think this mixes and kneads the dough more thoroughly than the Oster did.
My breads have come out softer and with a better texture.2.
The cycles on the Breadman seem to be more specific (and are also manually adjustable).
For example, I can choose a 1 lb., 1.5 lb.
size for any cycle, and it adjusts the times accordingly.
The Oster only had a crust setting that you could adjust for each cycle.3.
This is probably a good thing with regard to kneading thoroughly.
But if you make larger loaves, sometimes any loose flour will kick up out of the pan until it's mixed in.
Also, the faster speed causes the machine to buzz and rattle, and sometimes move across the counter.
I wish I could adjust the paddle speed.2) As some have said before, I think the motor in this machine is underpowered.
It does struggle (slow down) sometimes with larger or heavy dough.
It has not completely stopped, but I worry that the motor might burn out sooner than later.
The Oster motor never stalled or slowed down.A couple tips:1) Make sure you watch the dough during the kneading cycle.
I would first do the recipes from scratch that came with the machine, using the ingredients and settings they recommend.
Don't use water too hot or you'll kill the yeast.
But starting out with warm water makes a BIG difference in how the dough rises.
I owned and liked a more basic Breadman machine.
But I'd been wanting a better model, and my husband got me this one for my birthday.
I like the fact that it makes a more *traditional* horizontal loaf.
This is the second bread machine that I've used.
This makes 2lb loafs which are the smallest I'd want to make.The controls are clear and intuitively placed.
There's control for the crust type, loaf size and type of bread.
If you have bread making experience that would be helpful.
I've also noticed some inconsistancy from loaf to loaf.
I've made a lot of very dense small loafs that tasted great but where pretty small and heavy.
It gave a great overview on machine bread making with photos and explanations as to the how and why's of ingredience and dough consistancy.
What happens if your bread does or does not do certain things and how to adjust the recipie.
But it does make great bread.One feature I find particularly useful is that it controls the temperature in the chamber when it's kneading and rising.
This has been a staple appliance in our kitchen for the last 2 years.
It has performed flawlessly and turns out some delicious breads.
It is somewhat unobtrusive as it sits in the corner on the counter and does not draw attention to itself.
Have had my Breadman TR2200C for over two weeks now and have baked in it almost daily, sometimes more than once.
Have owned a bread machine before which I used only to mix the dough as the baking results and shape were not desirable.
Also, have been an old fashioned breadmaker for over 30 years.
Time for a real change now!The Breadman does a wonderful job and is soooo easy to use.
Have made wheat, white, French bread recipes and all come out beautifully IF you use the correct yeast with the correct cycle.
No dough hook hole in the final product this way.
Baking results have always been good and as expected.
The add ingredients feature has worked perfectly for me.
What more can I add?  Get one for yourself, your kids, your friends.
First of all, this is a 'tried and true' machine.
The reason I can say that is that it came packed with a VCR tape of what I assume to be instructions and baking tips.
I'm sure a more contemporary model would have included a DVD.The machine is remarkably forgiving.
I wanted to make the Cinnamon Raisin Bread so I carefully mixed the ingrediants added them to the loaf pan and started setting the machine.
I also took the paddle out before the bread was punched down.
This is especially a problem at the end of the baking cycle when the pan is super hot.
The reader may wish to invest in a pair of silicone oven mitts.
Mine were too thick and padded to work at releasing the pan.
Cleanup was a breeze and took about 2 minutes.One reviewer mentioned removing the paddle and shaping the loaf prior to the third (final) rise.
This leads to another suggestion that would improve this model, namely a signal that the final 'knead' was complete.
That way, the baker would not have to stand over the machine like a mother hen waiting for her brood to hatch.11/4/05 Update:  Another 'hint'.
I loosely cover the top with a dish towel that has been moistened with warm water.
This allows the bread to rise a bit more than simply relying on the machine.
Tonight, I baked 'Carraway Seed Rye', and this normally heavy bread came out with a lighter consistency than one would expect.
Don't waste time downloading and printing the manual unless you are bored or have plenty of paper to waste.
I have a Breadman Ultimate that my hubby bought for me about 4 years ago and it's still going strong.
We eat a lot of bread and I use the machine about 3 times a week, maybe more.
It's really a great machine and we've gotten our money's worth out of our first one.
The metal is very light weight, and if immersed into cold water while hot, will torque out of shape.
That's why you see other's who's pans have warped.Anyway, I followed the directions and my first 2 pound loaf of white bread just finished.
It really turned out better than I expected.
I did keep an eye out for any flour build up in the corners, but it wasnt a problem.
The paddle stayed inside the pan after it was done baking, leaving only a small hole.
The pan and bread are both cooling off on a rack.
At NO TIME did my bread pad jump off the "clips", and it isnt as noisy as my old breadmaker was.
Also, the machine did stayed put....no dancing around the counter top.The bread is about the same height as "store bought" white bread.
I looks a tiny, tiny bit smaller in size than I thought it would, and it might not have risen fully.
That could be my fault, as I "peeked" a few times during each cycle, to be sure all was going well.
You can buy replacement paddles and pans, but that's all.
If this fails after 5 years, it only cost me just shy of $64.00.
If that's the case, then they should have made it to bake a  1 1/2, 2 and 2 1/2 pound loaf.
MAKE SURE THE FLUIDS ARE RIGHT AROUND 80 DEGREES...DONT "GUESS"...BUY A THERMOMETER.
I PRE WARM MY BAKING PAN ( RUN THE OUTSIDE UNDER HOT WATER FOR A COUPLE SECONDS)THEN ADD MY WARMED FLUIDS.
TOO COOL, THE YEAST WONT ACTIVATE.....TOO HOT, YOU'LL KILL THE YEAST.3.
DONT BAKE BREAD IF THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE LOW, FALLING OR IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE.
THAT WILL EFFECT THE RISING PROCESS AND GIVE YOU STUNTED BREAD.
THE HIGHER THE PRESSURE, THE BETTER THE RISE AND "LIGHTER" DENSITY YOUR BREAD WILL BE.4.
IF YOU USE "QUICK RISE" YEAST, USE THE "QUICK RISE" CYCLE.5.
PUT A LITTLE COOKING OIL AROUND THE PEG,THEN SLIP ON THE MIXING PADDLE BEFORE YOU ADD YOUR FLOUR.
IT WILL SLIP OUT FOR CLEANING MUCH BETTER AFTER BAKING.........OR.........6.
I thought the power company would get us back online quickly, but it was not to be.
So, I every so often, I would punch it down, let it rise and repeat...for a total of 9 hours.
Finally at Midnight, the power came back and the bread had risen enough to bake.
I just hit the "bake" cycle,and adjusted the time down from 40 minutes to 38.
The crust was crunchy and the inside was so soft and well textured.
I was happy that this bread machine was easy to operate and had the bake only cycle.
That saved my bread dough from being thrown out.
I've had my Breadman Ultimate for at least 4 years.
I unplugged it and saved the dough, but now I have to think about replacing it.
I've read endless reviews for Breadman, Zojirushi, Panasonic, etc., but I think I'll get another Breadman.
I've only been disappointed with the results about four times--bread rose too high, bread collapsed once--both problems undoubtedly caused by early inexperience.
The Breadman overall does a very satisfactory job with all types of breads.
I often start a loaf in the machine and finish it in the oven because I like crusty crusts.
But I'm also very pleased with the breads I've baked in the Breadman.
Tom Lacalamita's, "The Ultimate Bread Machine Cookbook," is a great resource, by the way.
For the price, I doubt the Breadman can be beat.
The downsides for me are it's inability to knead heavier, wholegrain doughs, and the chute for adding extras (nuts, etc) is hard to clean.
Bread making is an art developed over time--even in a machine.
I was recently diagnosed with Celiac and can no longer partake in the lovely pleasure of eating breads made out of wheat flour.
Rest assured that this will be money well spent for a quality product with consistent results.
It's also superbly easy to clean!The Breadman machine is a must-have for anyone with a Celiac in the house!.
I can tell you that this idiot-proof machine goes from zero to staff-of-life in 3 hours 32 minutes.
Basically, it's like this: You dump in the liquid ingredients.
You make a little hole in the flour pile, for the yeast, and then you dump the yeast in there.
Just for laughs I dumped a bran-muffin ready-mix package into the 'honey banana bread' recipe - the result was better than the normal recipe.
You can dump in a lot of things - fruits, nuts, weird flours, molasses, rye, caraway and poppy seeds, oats - it all works.
I am a first-time bread machine owner and was actually astonished that the Breadman does everything that was promised with minimal tweaking.
If not, simply add a little water (up to a tablespoon at first), and help the unabsorbed flour etc.
into place with GENTLE nudges from a plastic spatula.
The machine then does the rest and does it magmificiently.
You are now free to go watch television, clean the house, play with computer, nag the spouse, or nap.
On the brighter side, I did not find the machine noisy or loud, certainly not as intrusive as the average dishwasher.
It's great and I cannot sing its praises too loudly!And, oh yes, the bread is scrumptious!.
I was not a big lover of bread until I bought this machine to make bread for my husband a few months ago.
I have made white, wheat, banana, cinamon raisin, maple sweet potato, dill, garlic, potato, and fantastic pizza dough just to name a few.
EVERY loaf has come out perfect even though I am not the most precise person when it comes to measuring.
I made ginger bread with the delay feature and WOW how nice the house smelled when we woke up.
I have not bought a loaf of bread since I bought the machine.
I have had no problems with the machine.
I bought this bread maker from Amazon a couple of weeks ago and I am really pleased.
I had my old breadmaker for years but it started to squeak so I decided to buy a new one.
It bakes in 3 and a half hours.
I suppose I could do a one and a half pound loaf, but I do like this nice big loaf.
We thought buying the bread at a grocery store is the easiest thing to do, until we made bread in this machine.
The instructions are very easy to follow and so are the recipes.
I tried whole wheat, French, fruit & nut, milk, Italian herb and yogurt breads so far and we loved them all.
More importantly our 1 year old son loves them all.
Need to yet experiment with the recipes, but we are happy with the basic recipes in the booklet.
Fruit & Nut bread is our favorite so far.
The dispenser is an added bonus.The price was unbeatable with the free shipping.
The only problem was that the cassette was already broken when we received it.
I haven't bought bread in years, and thought that my $50 Welbilt was the be-all-and-end-all.
But I wanted more, like programmability and a removable dough hook.
I was not expecting the difference that this machine delivers.First, it's well-built, unlike the mostly-plastic Welbilt.
Mine was a 75% off demo that someone had stolen the dough hook from.
When I finally cranked it up, I was rather stunned at the difference.
We even dared to set it up overnight.
So we had a lovely breakfast, but what got my attention was the perfect, fine-grained texture that had been missing before.
The instruction book comes with a helpful table that explains the various timings of all the programs.Overall, just very happy.
Here's how to do it even though you're setting it up overnight:Add all the ingredients except the yeast.
Let it mix for about ten minutes, then check the texture.
Cut a 1" circle of wax paper and poke it down into the top of the dough to form a container for the yeast.
Spoon the yeast into the wax paper, and go to bed.
I was given this bread machine and it was used but well cared for but the instruction manual had been misplaced.
This machine does the work and does it at the right time.
Real cooks, which I am not, tried my bread and all said it was better than they could make themselves.
If I can make homemade bread with this, trust me, any one can-it is that easy.
I recently purchased the Breadman Ultimate  after my old machine died after only 2 years of use.
Every loaf I've made so far has been outstanding.
Each time I use it, I fear I'll be disappointed (finally), but I never am.
Alas, I couldn't see paying $150 more for just that feature.
The best thing about the Breadman Ultimate? The price.
A mere $99 for such a wonderful machine (my old machine was $130 two years ago).
We bought this just over a year ago and will be buying another one for a family member as a gift.
Our machine is used at least twice a week with no trouble ever.
It's easy to clean and the paddle is still in great shape.
We make all of our own dough now.
If you do it before the bread rises and cookes it's MUCH easier to get out.
It also leaves a smaller hole in the finished bread.
I have had my Breadman for almost two years and have never had a problem with it.
Whole grain breads, fruit and vegetable breads, using the dough cycle-all completely reliable.
It's so enjoyable to have fresh wholesome bread at my convenience.
I just put all the pieces on a towel to air dry on the kitchen counter because I use it several times a day.
It's surprising that previous reviewers find this machine hard to clean.
The trick is to get a good quality vegetable brush.
Use it to clean your vegetables before juicing, and to clean the mesh basket after.
I just use water for daily cleanings and soap and water once a week.
Less than 2 minutes time for daily cleanup, not too bad if you ask me :).
This juicer is a very high quality juicer at an extremely low price.
It takes a mere minute or two to clean this sucker, when I've spent 5 minutes cleaning other juicers.
The Juiceman II also juices basically any vegetable you throw at it, unlike other juicers.
I've had no problem juicing the toughest of greens like kale, and even wheatgrass, which some say you need to buy a seperate juicer for.
Hogwash!  The Juiceman II does it just fine.I'm on my second model, because the first one died after about 2 or 3 years of use.
The reason it died was I tried to juice a frozen banana, which is not recommended.
Anyway, great model, and I'm glad I own one.
It's not so hot with softer fruits like nectarines or peaches, and I've yet to try tomatoes or pineapples.
It juiced grapes easily, though, handling the stems with no problem.
It requires a firm hand on top to keep it from rattling.
And the feed tube is a little small - a large apple has to be cut up into 8 pieces, not 4, to fit in.
You'll be wanting a sink that has a sprayer attachment; if you have that, cleanup takes about 60 seconds.
I do recommend lining the pulp box with a plastic bag for easy disposal.
Even if you do elevate the bag around the edges of the spout, you'll find that bits of pulp do manage to escape.
The pulp itself is dry and sort of sawdust-y, and would probably make good compost.One word of advice - start slow on the juices.
This juicer is able to juice a variety of fruits and vegetables.
Juicing is relatively quick and easy and yields delicious results.
The device is sturdy, but light enough to be moved around.
It has a simple design that performs very well, reminiscent of a good food processor.
There is a nice small recipe book that suggests interesting juice combinations.
It is a good value for this type of device.
A surprise is that it takes more veggies or fruits to create a certain amount of juice.
However, it makes sense when I think about it, and now I can see why the store varieties are so expensive.
I like the full one year warranty as well thought I haven't had to use it yet.
I love the iced tea and iced coffee that I can make with this machine.
I would have preferred if it made cold brewed iced coffee; it does not,it's a hot brew machine.
It takes up the least amount of space and the design is excellent.
I use one large tea bag, brew the tea, and then fill up the rest of the container with water instead of ice.
I put it in the refrigerator and when it gets cold, I have the perfect glass of iced tea.
If you are an iced tea addict too, then look no further.It does indeed require a fair amount of ice-- but let's think about why.
OR, you can use ice.This machine proportions it all PERFECTLY.
''Weak tea'' only happens when you don't use enough teabags.
I get the best results with 5 or 6 regular teabags.
(Ridges in basked, as mentioned before.) But you don't have to do that too often.BTW, a surprisingly great tea is the decaf &quot;Ambience&quot; blend from.
Smart & Final! This makes a PERFECT iced tea.
Like several other reviewers noted on the Mr.
Coffee Iced Tea Maker, the pitcher cracked after a couple years use.
Since the replacement pitcher was the same price as this, I decided to try it.
It is small, but perfect for 1-2 people.
It was not noisy and made perfect tea in about 10 minutes, maybe less time.
The only drawback is it does not permit strenght adjustment, so I only gave it four stars.
I had a smaller version of this for 5 years, used almost daily for veggie burgers and other meatless items.
I am moving into a larger place and decided to upgrade my grill.
This is great, just like the one before!.
Even grizzled old mountain men like me get tired of a steady diet of  squirrel stew.
Meanwhile, it shows no signs of wearing  out, and seems to be as handy as the day we ordered it.
Gee,  ain't technology great! It is a great product and I highly recommend it,  even for history buffs like me!.
I would have given it five stars if it had an on/off switch.
I do not like devices that are turned on and off via the plug.
Other than that one issue, this grill is perfect for toasted sandwiches of all kinds.
I do not eat slaughtered animals, so I can only comment on non-meat sandwiches.
great job and well worth the small amount of $$.
Keep in mind that it is small so it can only do one decent sized sandwich at a time.
It also does not have a timer for auto shut-off when the grilling is done.
but once I grilled salmon steaks on it, along with some veggies, I was happily surprised.
This will stay on my counter and I know it will be used often.
For quick, easy &quot;grilling,&quot; the George Foreman grill does the job.
No, it's not like grilling over charcoal or even a gas grill - but it does cook meat and fish evenly and quickly.
Do it right away - don't let it sit too long or it will be much  harder to clean up.
The George Foreman grill is one of those items you see it yard sales per $10-$15 used maybe once.
It's one of those items that people think is a hoax-a hack, but amazingly it's one of those items that works.
The fact that you can get a brand new one for $15 is amazing.
It's amazing, done in less than seven minutes, or try a frozen chicken breast from frozen to juicy and done in less than 10 minutes.
Perfect for bachelors or moms with bachelors in training or moms married to bachelors.
You get the point.So give it a shot perfect in what it does.
For the money I paid for it, it's pretty good.
I do like it and it's easy to clean, but for my family of 3, it's too small.
It's a perfect size for 1 or 2 people.
I tried grilling zucchini and could only fit 4 slices (lengthwise) at a time.
I bought four of these grills -- three for gifts and one for me.
We all like the GF grill very much and for different reasons.
My husband likes our grill because he can make a grilled cheese sandwich in two minutes and with no mess.
Prior to purchasing this grill, he could not make a grilled cheese sandwich.
This procedure took about 10 minutes and the added butter made the bread greasy.
We simply wipe it out with a paper towel.
I place the GF grill on the stove top so the fumes are sucked up the exhaust fan.
It takes about 6-7 minutes because both sides cook simultaneously.
My daughter loves the grill because it's easy enough for the kids to use and it only takes five minutes to grill a hamburger.
This is a nifty little grill and I am pleased to say it lives up to the advertisement I saw.
But it can also be used for sausage links, bacon, vegetables and grilled cheese sandwiches.Some people have mentioned they have real problems cleaning it up.
Whilst yes it could be better but you literally just scrape off any excess and wipe it down.
I've had my little grill for years now and it still works great.
I cook just for 1 so this size is big enough for me.
I've grilled meat, vegetables, and sandwiches in mine.
I definitely plan on upgrading eventually to a bigger grill with removable/interchangeable plates.
I have had no trouble with the temperature or how the meat comes out.
I have used it successfully and had juicy, properly cooked meats with the extra fat drained off.
Do not immerse, but you can do this sinkside because of the angled grill.
The size of this unit is just right for one person.I am eating more quality meats because of this grill--an improvement in my diet.
My cat gets the drippings dish, so she likes this grill, too!.
I received the champ grill as a Christmas gift over the holidays,and I have yet to go a week without using it.
This is just the right size for me since I live in a small apartment and by myself.
I love to grill hamburgers on the champ grill and watch the fat slowly drain away.
I also like to grill chicken breast on the grill.
I've grilled fish on the grill but the one problem with grilling fish is that trying to get rid of the fishy smell.
Eventually it goes away but after you clean the grill, you can still smell the remnants of dinner.
Just run a warm, soapy sponge over the grill and voila! The bits of food caked on the grill is removed.
I am overall pleased with the George Foreman grill.
To be honest I was sold on this product at 2am via George himself on the  television.
We have done hamburgers (5 stars), chicken sausages (4 stars),  many vegetables (4 stars) with very good success.
I am a cooking snob and  other than a rice cooker I tend to avoid gadgets in the kitchen and stick  to hand tools.
What this does for me is give a VERY LOW MESS way to cook  hamburgers during the winter (8 mos of 12 here in Chicago).
The George Foreman GR10AWHT Champ Grill is an outstanding unit per my daughter.
She uses it primarily when she is not going to be cooking outdoors.
Everything cooks up fast and stays moist and warm! She says it cooks to her liking consistently.
It is also easy to maintain and clean just like our other unit.
This little Foreman grill is perfect for 1 or 2 people.
Cleanup is so fast...I just pour some water on it while still hot, and the steam loosens everything up.
I just wipe it all off with a paper towel.My one complaint is that it doesn't have an on/off switch.
I hate seeing that little spark when I plug this into the wall to turn it on.
So, despite the excellent price and performance, I only gave it four stars.
So far I've only been using it for hamburgers, but it's worth it just for that.
I just put the meat on, and listen.
I can tell by the sound when it's done, no need to cut it open and look or even time it.
Cleans up with a paper towel or two.
My one complaint is it will only do one at a time, but if you want bigger ones, they are certainly available.
I purcahsed this item from a retail store many years back and it quickly became one of my favorite kitchen appliances.
My household has this GF Grill as well as a second larger one.
this is the best buy I have ever purchased for my kitchen.
Plug it in, let it heat, plop on the food, close the cover, wait a few minutes, and voila.
you got some GOOD EATS!!  I use mine at least four times a week.
Unplug it, let it cool down, wipe it down with a damp sponge, and follow up with a damp paper towel.
Toss the drip tray in the dishwasher and you're ready to go.
You'll get more mileage out of the Foreman grill than you'll get from any other small appliance in your kitchen.
Love this thing and we use it a few times a week.
Besides burgers, it grills onions, peppers and other vegis.
I got a recommendation to get this little grill from a guy who is a personal trainer and an absolute maniac about eating right.
This little thing is absolutely amazing.It is really rather like a waffle iron.
Our particular brand of veggie burger is very tasty but needs to be carefully cooked for 8 minutes, usually, on the stove.
If it cooks even a little too long, it gets rubbery and dry.
I chose 4 minutes, figuring that the top and bottom simultaneous grilling would cut the time in half.
The amount of grease that poured off made my eyebrows shoot to the ceiling.What made my purchase decision difficult was the number of models offered.
There is a cute version with a bun warmer, and several models with larger grills.
While I like the idea of a bun warmer, it's not essential, though would have been nice for the pita.
We usually grill only one or two things for a quick meal, so I opted for the basic model and I am pretty happy.
It takes up little space on the counter.
I really was surprised how nicely this grill does work.
No one wants to be blamed for poisoning the family with undercooked pork.
If you elect to use a broiler, a moment's inattention can turn beautifully browned sausage into charred twigs of pork in just a few seconds.
Lay your defrosted breakfast sausage links on the grid parallel to the ribs, close the lid and set the timer for another 5 minutes.There.
While the sausage cooks, you're free to mix the waffle batter or put on another pot of coffee.
The sausage comes out perfectly browned above and below, and thoroughly cooked all the way through while remaining juicy.
The Champ grill works just as well with rock-hard frozen links straight from the freezer.
it is very difficult to cook more than one burger at a time.
A 6" by 7" cooking surface is just too small for two burgers.
You might want to put a folded paper towel under the drip tray.The 'Champ' performs particularly well in grilling cheese, tomato and ham sandwiches.
The grill doesn't wear out...we just upgraded to a larger version.
This purchase was a gift for someone special who also wants to change their eating habits.
Just remember to always use non-stick spray before heating and wipe it with paper towels immediately after using.
I got my first George Foreman grill when I was in college and living in a dorm.
I highly recommend this grill - it's worth every cent!.
I received my grill as a gift almost a  year ago, and have used it almost every day since.
I wish it had an on/off switch rather than just the plug, but that's the only downside I have found.
It's very fast, easy to clean up, and the meats, seafood, and poultry taste great.
Much cheaper to run than the broiler in the stove, and quicker and better than the broiler in my toaster oven.
This grill is great for hamburgers, chicken, hot dogs, etc.
It cooks fairly quickly and the fat that drains out is really gross.
Just think about other cooking methods -  you'd be eating that [fat] normally.
I have also done veggies (onions, zuccini, summer squash) on the grill and they come out fabulous.
Just be sure to cut the veggies the same thickness or they won't cook evenly.
If you're cooking for more than 2 people, you'd probably want the larger version, but this is great for 1 or 2 people.
My wife and I received our George Foreman grill as a wedding gift almost seven years ago.
Fortunately, though, this little grill is still rocking and rolling along.
It's one of the most important appliances we use in the house.
If our family expands any time soon, we'll probably upgrade to a larger grill, but for now, this one's perfect.
It's also wonderful for singles and college students.A favorite thing of mine to grill on the George Foreman grill is chicken breasts.
It's simple, fast, and great to eat.Highly recommended!.
I use this smaller version when I am at college.
It is a great way to prepare home-cooked food quickly, easily and without a mess.
This is my second GF grill -- simply because we use it all the time and wore out other one out.
We only cook for 2 in our house, so this size is perfect.
I recommend one of the bigger grills if you have more mouths to feed.
I have no clue if this product existed before George Foreman put his name on it.
Whatever the case, the Foreman grill has become a staple in most kitchens around the world.
It cooks any meat within 5 minutes, perfectly every time.
I doubted that the George Foreman Grill would work.
Let's be honest, it's advertised on an infomercial.
But after the thirtieth time of seeing the informercial, I began to wonder.
I cooked two chicken breasts, and they were done in 4 minutes or so.
Tasted like I had BBQed them outside (of course, can't do that--live in an apartment).
What i love about this is that it cooks so quickly--faster and more tastier than a microwave (healthier too).
Clean up is simple, just wipe the grill surface.
But when time is a premium, the George  Foreman Grill is a Godsend!  It sears and grills meats like no other indoor  grill.
The angled cooking surface channels fat into the included drip tray  to minimize the fat in meats.
It  includes a tool to scrape any particles away.
The cooking surface is  non-stick, so even burnt foods come off easily.Not only does meat cook  in minutes without turning, the juices are locked inside.
You'll be  surprised how delicious your steaks and burgers taste.
No more dried out  food!My father-in-law loves his George Foreman grill!  His wife loves to  microwave everything.
So he's used to dry, chewy, unappealing steaks.
This is one of the few TV-advertised bits of cookware that actually lives up to its reputation.
I have a GF Grill and love it when I want to cook something quick.
Its compact, easy to use and easy to clean.
I bought it for grilled sandwiches - which I make very often (and I really hate the "hot pocket" kind of machine).
The good news is that it heats up evenly and really fast and you have a delicious sandwich in no time at all.
The bad news is, that the outer body also gets burning hot.
If you are buying this product, take the user manual seriously and wear oven mitts while handling the machine.
As a relatively lazy bachelor and a mediocre cook, the Foreman is the best way to cook food.
Salmon steaks and regular steaks take less than 10 minutes and taste fantastic.
The only thing I can say that's bad about the Foreman is when you cook, you see all the grease drip off into the pan.
It makes you feel disgusted that if you were to cook this conventionally, you'd be eating that grease.
I am amazed at how quickly this cooks.
I prepared chicken breasts (including trimming, marinating, and cooking) in less than 15 minutes.
This is a wonderful tool for the lazy, hungry single chef.Notes: 1.) This model is very, very tiny.
While the grooved top and bottom plate give food those nice &quot;grill lines,&quot; they are a tad difficult to maneuver around and clean effectively.
I would suggest purchasing a handled sink scrubbing brush to assist you with the task.4.) It heats up in an instant -- literally.
I use it for grilling hot dogs and sausages.
That's why I wouldn't purchase the family grill, I don't like the idea of not being able to wash it under the sink.
If it were removable maybe?If you are single and don't cook much.
But if cooking is your thing, invest in a nice stove top grill.
The George Foreman Grill is as it was delivered.
But as hard as I looked,  I didn't see the comments by the seller.
But there was no grease catacher or grill scraper.
Here's a typical dinner: I cut up some red onion and bell peppers and place them on the pre-heated grill.
They take maybe two minutes per side to grill, becoming sweet and caramelized.
Meanwhile, I marinate a flank steak in fresh lime juice and garlic.
When the veggies are done, I grill the flank steak, maybe three minutes per side.
(I turn everything over midway because I find otherwise the food doesn't get the grill marks evenly on both sides.)Meanwhile, I warm up some tortillas.
Finally, I slice the flank steak, and serve veggies, meat, and tortillas with cheese and salsa for do-it-yourself fajitas.
Takes seconds to clean.After over a year, the finish is still as good as new.
Enjoy a hot, tasty meal and save cash while you're at it!.
If you need to cook more, get a bigger grill.
I've even grilled two slices of Pepperidge Farm french toast and warmed vegtables wrapped in foil!!  It cooks thoroughly and quickly.
Just place a cello sponge between the grilling plates so the non-stick surface isn't damaged.Speaking of non-stick...it's fantastic.
The little indicator light stopped working after about 3 months, but that hasn't affected the grill's performance.
Let frozen foods thaw thoroughly or they will be overcooked before the inside is cooked.
The hash browns take about 10 minutes to get crispy.
We bought this grill in 2002 and it is still working.
I think we do ourselves a favor by caring to not use anything that will scratch the grill.
The temperature control on it is perfect, and it grill so fast because it cooks the top and bottom at the same time.
Bought small ones for both the kids when they moved out and they love them and use them regularly.
The grill is like for one maybe 2 people but the non stick coating is good and the price was right.
Removable plates would have been nice but you won't get that at this price point.
I've had a several variations on the small George Foreman Champ grills.
This model was the first.I have literally worn a number of GF grills out.
And they last well when cared for! I use my GF a LOT.
They are great when making a meal in the summer.
It doesn't noticeably heat the room like the broiler in my oven and I think it uses much less power all year round.
Behind the steak is a steamy spot on the grill and those veggies cook to perfection with the steak.
With fish I like to use a very light coating of Mayo.
This seems to help make pink and white fish even more detectibly moist and tasty.
With steak and meats the grill works great with rubs and spices.
I really like the Paul Prudome "magic" line of spices.
In my experience steak cold out of the fridge of the same size/thickness is done to medium in about 5 to 6 minutes.
The timing is just about second nature now.The non-stick surface isn't perfect.
Fish has a greater tendency to stick than anything else.Cleanup is oh so easy.
While one must not put their little GF in the dishwasher or immerse it it's still pretty easy to clean.
I do wish the plates were removable!Cleanup for me starts just after the food comes off.
I give it a quick hot wipe with a paper towel to get the bulk off.
I thoroughly wash the plates and clean the catch tray.
Then I use the clean catch tray to rinse the plates of soap, then drain it and both air dry.
Water all flows into the sink and it's really clean.
It all takes a minute or two.This is a great tool.
Just a little reminder: while all the GF Champ grills have been very self-consistent there can be small variations between units.
For years, I have seen television infomercials and the like rave about the George Foreman Grill.
What do I cook on it being a vegetarian?Veggie burgers come out very nicely.
Boca Burgers, Gardenburgers, and other brands taste great, when cooked on the grill, and it is very fast.
Frozen veggie burger is done in 5-7 minutes.
Yes, the grill is small, but it is not tiny.
You can fit two small boca burgers on it.Other items I have cooked on it includes soy chicken-style filets and frozen french fries.
One thing that amazes me is how quickly it cooks a simple grilled cheese sandwich.
About 100 seconds, and the grilled cheese sandwich is browned, cheese completely melted, and tastes great.
The appearance of the food cooked on the grill is something I like too.
Sandwiches and veggie burgers come out with beautiful grill marks and a fantastic texture.The design of the grill seems impressive.
It heats up quite quickly, in less than five minutes, and it is simple to use.
Plug in the grill, and unplug the grill, when you are finished cooking.
There are not any knobs or switches to accidently set incorrectly.
Of course, the grill is cooking your food very quickly, so be cautious because it does get very hot.
For my veggie stuff, hardly any residue is left behind on the grill.
However, even if you don't eat meat, you'll find plenty of goodies to cook quickly and easily.
I'd highly recommend it, especially for the price.
It is a wonderful grill for 1 or 2 people, if you don't have a fancy cooktop or range that comes with a grill.
I used it to make salmon teriyaki and the salmon came out real tender on the inside, with a nice grilled flavor.
Cleaning is not too bad either as the nonstick surface seems to be permanently in tact.
The only thing I wondered about this grill is why the drip pan was a flimsy white plastic and not aluminum or stainless steel.
Although oil cools fast, I found myself worrying that the plastic would melt as soon as the oil dripped onto it.
But of course it didn't and the drip pan cleaned well, so I can't give minus points for this one...!.
Low-carb dieters will love this little grill!  I've cooked sausage links, burgers, and various grades of beef and pork, all with wonderful results.
The meats come out relatively juicy, and minus a good deal of fat.
Additionally, you can have you dinner in less than 10 minutes.Their are two difficulties.
Uneven cuts of meat or fish are very difficult to cook.
The best bet is to cut piece into sections that are of equal thickness.
Along the same line, cuts that are over 1 1/2 to 2 inches do not cook all the way through.
Additionally, clean up, though not too difficult, can be messy.
Give thought to a larger one, however--especially for families.
the george foreman lean mean fat reducing grilling machine is what all single men need in their lives.
it heats up quickly and cooks BOTH sides of your food evenly.
ive been cooking chicken breasts lately and what little fat is on them rolls down right into the drip tray.
this product is the bomb and will help the single male species include more nutrition in their diet and a healthier alternative to pizza delivery.
im a BIG fan of the infomercial too.
george is so engaging, entertaining, and witty! come on george, come on america, lets KNOCK OUT THE FAT!.
I have had this grill for about 6 years now, and it is still fun to use.
Beats frying of broiling beef or chicken, and keeps me inside in winter instead of starting the grill.
I suggest you use this under an exhaust fan by the stove, it can put out some smoke.
Easy to do Salmon steaks up on as well.
I also have done sausages and hot dogs for a change as well.
More handy than I ever thought it would be.
Even grizzled old mountain men like me get tired of a steady diet of  squirrel stew.
It is  easy to use, quick to clean up, and healthy because of all the grease it  whisks away from the food itself.
Gee, ain't technology great! It  is a great product and I highly recommend it, even for history buffs like  me!.
The ENTIRE burger is cooked exactly the same.
The first time I used this Foreman grill I overcooked them by.
There IS something I definitely need to mention however.
Always make sure you keep an eye on your burgers.
Don't leave the room for several minutes to watch TV, surf the internet or talk on the phone.
STAY in the kitchen and continue to open and close the lid every single minute until your burger is done.
I do believe these grills suck up a LOT of electricity, which is why I've occasionally had my breaker box shut down while cooking.
When the burgers are done, well I recommend waiting another 5 or 10 minutes until you clean the grill off.
I admit the grill DOES produce a lot of grease and cleaning is an absolute requirement every time you use it.
The only downside to an otherwise brilliant grill.
how long does it take until this grill loses its power or just stops working completely?.
Everyone that I knew who bought one of these things loved it.
Not only did they love it, they couldn't stop talking about it.
All that I can say is that they were correct.
It's very easy to use and flavor isn't sacrificed.
This one is perfect for a couple or a single.
There is a larger size available if you're cooking for more people.
I'll admit it -- I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to kitchenware.
I love to cook, I entertain frequently, and I collect cookbooks.
I'd heard about the George Foreman Grill, and generally figured it wasn't for me.
I have  to say -- I was VERY pleasantly surprised.As others have said, it's  virtually fool-proof.
There's no &quot;on-off&quot; switch -- you plug it  in, wait for it to heat up, and start cooking.
It has a short cord to prevent accidents, so if you don't have  an outlet handy, it could be awkward.
You pretty much have to figure  things out for yourself.That said, it does a fine job on steak, salmon,  chicken breast, and pork chops.
I haven't tried it on veggies or sausages  yet, but I anticipate no problems.
The food turns out nicely seared (in a  grill-stripe pattern), and juicy inside.My biggest complaint is  clean-up.
You cannot immerse the grill in water, so you have to do the  best you can with paper towels and damp sponges.
I  anticipate using it far more than I expected I would.
I've only had it a  week, and I've already used it 4 times.
I first saw this grill on an online review show, where they looked at various infomercial products.
This one received some of the highest ratings.
However, don't assume that it really does reduce the fat much.
Yes, you will see drippings draining off, and some of that is fat.
But a lot of it is just water.
Doesn't really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods.
Other than that though, a very good product.
I love my George Foreman Grill - I bought this larger size after buying the smallest one that holds just 2 burgers.
Chicken breasts are the very best thing to cook; the chicken is tender and juicy and just takes a few minutes.
Sometimes it slides away and the fat drips onto the counter top.
Even grizzled old mountain men like me get tired of a steady diet of squirrel stew.
It is easy to use, quick to clean up, and healthy because of all the grease it whisks away from the food itself.
Gee, ain't technology great! It is a great product and I highly recommend it, even for history buffs like me!.
I know the commecials are compelling -- seems you can cook anything -- but  I would focus on this as a great off-season bbq grill.
Hamburgers, sausages  and other red meats do well.
Great for families and get togethers -- my brothers swear by the hamburgers  -- and it is also fun.
I don't think this will replace my stove or broiler  but it also won't be at a garage sale next year.
I'd also opt for the  larger unit (XXL) unless you are only cooking for one.
Does a great job of cooking indoors with out a mess.
The instructions and cooking suggestions could have been more, but without a doubt anyone that buys this product will be pleased.
Yes, the ad shows for burgers, chicken, etc.
for sandwiches, but I use this thing mostly for bacon.
Practically no mess and clean up means sacrificing about a half dozen paper towels.
If the splatter doesn't get you, the grease injestion will.
But for cooking burgers and then the buns indoor, this grill is top rate.
The smaller ones just aren't big enough for more than one person.
We had bought a small grill (with bun warmer) which worked very well.
However, I underestimated what size we needed and realized later that what we should have purchased was a much larger item.
I hated to spend more money for a larger version of what I already had, but truth to tell "size does matter".
There was no way to fit 4 nice sized burgers on the little grill, although 2-3 cooked great and tasted delicious.
Later on, I read reviews that mentioned this.
And the capacity is perfect - not too big, not too small.
I'm able to get 2 really huge steaks (can you hear my arteries clogging?) on with no problem.
Someone, either on this site or elsewhere advised how and I'll pass this on to you.
After you've removed the cooked food, unplug the grill and lay damp paper towels on the grill and close the lid.
Secondly, this doesn't have a timer or temperature adjustment.
Then I turn the food over and cook that side.
Then for a few minutes (depending upon how done we want the food) I close the lid and let both sides cook.
I don't find this to be a problem or bothersome at all and I'm happy with how things turn out.
For us to get our food medium or med.
well, I've found that closing the lid for the entire duration of cooking blackens or burns the outer part of the meat.
Because this is no longer availabe at Amazon I think perhaps it's not longer available anywhere.
But I would suggest that for grills that are not removable, the way I described to clean this one would work equally well on another.
I make a mean egg, tunafish,and macaroni salad, mixed with diced green peppers and some slices of onion, as well.
But to get it right you need great hard boiled eggs, which for aklutz like me is the single hardest part of the cooking process.
You can then place the cooked eggs in cool water to complete the process.
The cooker handles up to six eggs and also features a water measure with a piercing spike on the bottom, form-fitted with an egg depression.
This serves to keep the egg from cracking during the boiling process.
All in all, this is a handy, useful, and relatively simple device to use.
I love them hot and I love them cold.
They can be a great source of protein for non-vegan vegetarians.
The machine works on the principle that once the water surround the eggs is all boiled away, then the eggs will be done.
You adjust the time the machine cooks the eggs by adjusting the amount of water.
I've messed with trying different types of cooking, and came up with a fairly good soft-boiled egg.
I had to experiment a little to get it, though.
There are two little poaching pans included with the appliance, but I've never used them.
When the eggs are done, a buzzer will sound to tell you to come get them.
The other cookers I looked at were either carousel-round or square, taking up much more space.
This little jewel fits perfectly in an overhead cabinet, taking up no more room than a small plastic container.
Soft is medium-soft (white done, yolk liquid) medium is a medium hard yolk, and hard is the harboildegg for picnics and salads.
(Some European models have a soft setting that is a very liquid egg such as you'd use in Caesar salad dressing.
There is an alarm to alert you when it's done, and an on-off-warm switch.
All in all, a great device--well designed, compact and useful.
Soft boiled eggs come out perfect, and I'll note that hard boiled ones seem to peel so much more easily than pan-boiled.
After about a dozen uses, mine is still intact.
Maybe time will wear it down, or maybe they improved the surface.
I do lightly oil it after every use, as suggested in the instructions.
I bought this egg cooker to eat healthier.
it is just the right size, and makes the eggs perfectly.
I poach, and scramble eggs in it all the time.
If you want a nice little egg cooker, I really suggest  investing in this fine product.
I always start cooking eggs on the weekend and then forget about them.
15 minutes later, I start smelling the smoke from my burned-beyond-recognition eggs.
I've used it a few times already and I can't believe how perfectly my eggs turn out.
and it has a buzzer that I can't ignore! Great value.
neat little kitchen gadget that takes up very little space (even the cord wraps around a groove in the base).
Hot!  And those popular coffeemakers just don't cut it.
This is a percolator, meaning it brews coffee OR, simply use it as a drip coffee maker.
You don't have to worry about warm coffee here.
You can leave it plugged and it will maintain the heat for long time.
I replaced my Mr Coffee 4-cup coffee maker with a Farberware 4-cup percolator.
When my drip coffee maker bit the dust a month ago, I started sifting through the various styles, makes, sizes, etc.
and the customer reviews for a replacement.My kitchen is almost minuscule and I cook A LOT and counter space is at a real premium.
After years of drinking not very hot and not very strong drip coffee I thought I would try a perc.
I love it, get one!Update, after about 8 months the perc is still going strong.
Since I make 8 cups every day (leftovers go into an iced coffee pitcher) the unit tends to need cleaning often.
I've owned my Farberware Perc for over 25 years.
I have a second one I got an excellent deal on as a back-up.
There seemed to be a streak/batches of bad thermostats that just didn't last long.
The currant one has been in use for at least 5 years.
The clean pot makes the best tasting coffee.
It gets pretty sad tasting when the pot is dirty.I have to edit the cleaning part.
I just got "new and improved Oxyclean" and it's got a much larger scoop in it.
So I have to suggest using 2 teaspoons or a tablespoon of Oxyclean to a pot of water.
Still works just as well as I just cleaned my pot.
There is nothing like a percolator for delicious coffee.
I LOVE this model! Give it as gifts.
I set it up the night before so when I get up in the morning I can just plug it in.
Pretty soon the sound of 'perking' goes on and the aroma of old fashioned coffee fills the room.
I have gotten rid of my drips and filters...goodbye modern that is expensive and tastes mediocre.
BE SURE AND GRIND FRESH BEANS AT YOUR MARKET ON THE SETTING 'ELEC PERC'.
This pot is great if you like percolated coffee.
But, take the coffee chamber out immediately after it is finished brewing.
Rather than a warming coil, this pot re-percolates the coffee to keep it hot.
I gave up on drip coffee makers because I like really HOT coffee -- cannot be TOO hot!  This is perfect for using daily.
For this reason I make enought for two mugs and unplug it after is stops perking.
I paid $19.99 for mine at Macy's one day sale with a $10 coupon.
I noticed people on eBay paying up to $50 for this same unit.Enjoy!!!.
It is recommended to remove the basket after brewing, and that is no easy task when hot.
I like the way it keeps coffee hot without burning.
About as messy as a press to clean.
I lost one of the parts to my original Farberware Super Fast percolator, which was about 35 years old.
So, when I saw this great deal on Amazon, I decided to replace the old one.
The new percolator looks almost identical and it does indeed make really great tasting hot coffee "super fast".
The 4 cup size is perfect for those mornings when it's just me who will be drinking coffee.
My only "complaint" is that the inside parts (stem and basket) don't seem quite as sturdy as the ones from my old unit.
Overall, I think it's a very good product and I love the fact that the appearance has remained the same.
I purchased the Farberware 8 Cup Percolator to replace my other Farberware percolator that I had for 10 years.
The other one I had only went because of problems with the base it was the type with a timer/base that they discontinued.
I purchased a good 'ol reliable Superfast Farberware Percolator about a month ago and LOVE IT.
My coffee is always piping hot, it does perk very quickly and I enjoy using it everyday.
I would buy again and/or give as a gift with no doubts.
Others are more expensive but not any better, this one is great for coffee lovers like myself.
I've been using a standard drip coffee maker for years and years.
I got a little concerned about mold, plastic leaching etc.
so thought I would try one of these all-stainless percolators after reading reviews.I am THRILLED at the wonderful coffee this little percolator makes.
It does everything automatically - makes an entertaining burbling sound as it brews; puttting out a delicious aroma in the process.
The coffee itself is absolutely the most flavorful I have ever brewed.
It's nice not to have to worry about buying and throwing away any filters.I'll never ever brew coffee any other way.
I'm a simple regular black coffee drinker and for me this is the best cup of coffee I could ever ask for.
The simple pleasures of life are the best and I'm actually excited to make my morning coffee with this little jewel!.
It is a 6 cup, which translates to 3 mugs in my house.
With four adult coffee drinkers in our home, whoever got up last had to make more coffee.
On weekends, we were running the poor little thing all day.
I found this 12 cup model and did not hesitate to order it.
It works exactly as the small one does, making a full pot in about 10 minutes.
Now we all get a first cup and most of us get a second.
My parents still like this kind of coffee maker, so I purchased one for them 3 yrs ago, and it still works fine.
After using drip makers for years (and experiencing them leaking, not making good tasting coffee, made cheaply, breaking), I tried this percolator.
My mom and aunts and grandma always used farberware percolators.
They are made well, clean easily, last long, look nice, and make a great cup of coffee.
I will never go back to a drip.
I finally have a good cup of coffee that stays hot until the last drop.
That is my major complaint out drop coffee makers the coffee doesn't stay hot.
I always have to pour my coffee and then put it in the microwave.
The taste of the coffee is also the best I have had.
A great, fast little percolator for the money.
The heating element gave out on my old one after 5 years.
This one was $25 off so I couldn't pass up the deal.
This one fits the bill if you don't have a lot of all-day coffee drinkers in the house.
I usually make a full pot in the a.m., unplug it and reheat again in the p.m.
My mother wanted a small electric percolator and requested Farberware by name.
I ignored her request and shopped around and found this percolator highly recommended, so I bought one.
My mom was right again and she loves it.
Nothing like a hot pot of freshly brewed coffee in the mornings, and this makes it happen.
Starts perking as soon as it's plugged in.
After reading the positive and critical reviews of this particular Farberware Percolator, I am very happy I decided to purchase it.
I haven't used a percolator in years and although I trusted the brand, I didn't know if I would really like the style.
I chose the 8-cup which is perfect for the two of us instead of the 10-cup or 12-cup.
Yes, the cord is short but for our set up, it works just fine.
I understand if a longer cord is needed, it can be purchased.
After several pots, we found the amount of coffee to produce medium strength coffee was perfect for us.
Unlike a couple of reviewers, our percolator produces one HOT pot of coffee!.
I use a drip coffee filter in my basket and the coffee has no grounds and tastes great.G.
I recently purchased the Farberware 8 cup coffee percolater.
Let me tell you this produces the hottest cup of coffee I have ever had.
Time to go back to a proven workhorse and Farberware is the right choice.
Bravo Farberware, My grandparents used you, My parents used you, and hopefully I will be a lifer.
As usual this is the very best coffee pot.
I have purchased only one other coffee pot for years and I hated it.
I used this for making 2 large cups and it is quick to perk.
I also try to use it for 1 large cup (12 oz.
and I find that it does not perk enough.
I tried adding more coffee, but that gets to be expensive and shouldn't.
it should have a timer of how long you want it to perk.That would solve my problem.
I do recommend this for someone who want to get 3 cups of very hot coffee.
I like my coffee real hot and this one does the job.
Had the first one for 5 or 6 years.The reason I got a new one, the inside bottom of pot lost some of its finish.
Didn't seem to effect coffee.Find it easier to make coffee and clean than those other drip models.
Bought it as a gift and whenever I go visit I have the best coffee!  It perks amazingly fast, stays hot and never gets bitter.
so I'll return this for a larger percolator.
Coffees and a Krups, and this simple device makes a great cup of hot coffee!.
This is the fourh Farberware coffee pot I have bought.
It is far superior to any other electric pot I've ever used, the coffee is always excellent and VERY hot.
The only problem is that after two, three years it stops working efficiently and needs to be replaced.
Maybe I will be lucky this time and it will last longer, therefore the four stars.
I had forgotten how much better percolated coffee tastes compared to drip.
Even after sitting in the pot for an hour, the coffee still tastes fresh.
After an hour in the drip coffee makers, the coffee was bitter and murky.
We use less coffee per pot and less is dumped out due to being old.
The only reason I didn't order the 12-cup programmable one is because of all the reviews saying it quits working after a few months.
I am hoping this one holds up better.
Even if it does konk out after a few months, I'll still buy another percolator.Added: It konked out after 6 months.
I have been using the Faberware 4-6 and 6-8 cup perculators for several years.
I will have a better idea of how good the Millenium is after several months (If it last that long).
The new pots have a grounded plug making it a lot safer.
I went so far as to change the receptacle to a ground fault detector just in case.
These pots have a tendancy to fail rather quickly if used 2 to 4 times daily.
I had one last year (A 6-8 cup) only last 2 months!  I don't know what the difference is between the Millenium and the non-millenium.
The only difference was the word Millenium on one of them.
All I can say about the pot is that it makes an excellent cup of coffee in 5 minutes.
When I compared my old 4-6 cup to the new one, there was a noticeable difference in the quality.
Ordered yesterday, arrived today just in time for afternoon coffee.
I finally had a cup of hot enough coffee and great tasting coffee.
Only use it about one or two days a week since I go out often for breakfast.
Hers just stopped working a couple months back.
Mkae sure you wash it well after each use.
Seen on another site people saying it rust.
So, I purchased the 2-4 cup coffee maker by Farberware.
I had my best cups of coffee since I began to use it and am in coffee heaven.
However, it is a HOT pot and one must take precautions when lifting the lid and handling it if it is still plugged in.
Yes, the coffee pot stays on and there is no turn off switch.
Coffee is hotter and it's easy to clean,no nooks and crannies.
Made in China, but quality appears to be good.
Makes a fast 8 cups of coffee and easy to clean.
Cute Machine.But - It has several unsafe features.
This coffee maker and I have a long relationship.
I have bought it for all my family members who drink coffee and they all love it.
I did have one incident and that is with the first cord.
After two years it heated up too fast and flipped the circuit.
I replaced the chord and it works well again.
The coffee is hot and because it percolates the coffee you can use less of it, especially if you grind it very fine.
It is cute too, washes easily, Dip-It cleans the residue that accumulates over time.
Most important thing to remember is to always, always pour the water in first.
Forgetting the water and plugging it in equals ruined coffee maker.
Only down side is if you forget to turn it off.
Love, love, love! this little perculator! - so much that I bought a second one for the office, all my co-workers are jealous! LOL.
I got so tired of breaking and not being able to replace glass coffee carafes.
Not to mention they can be bulky in a smallerkitchen.
This percolator makes 12 cups of great coffee inminimum time, 12 minutes tops maybe less.
I just used the coffee I had on hand with no problems.
They recommend cleaning the unitas needed  with a drip coffee maker.
I have no complains thus far you can keep the coffee warm in the pot without transferringto a thermos.
Easy to clean and store, use with a filter fromMelita for easy to make coffee.
perfect for that quick cup of morning coffee for two.
I've come to appreciate the taste of percolater coffee rather then plastic coffee machines.
This perks it up no time and cleans up easy.
It makes an OK pot of coffee and does it quickly.
it makes an OK, about mediocre cup of coffee.
I've tried a few varieties of StarBucks as well as common brands such as Folgers and Chock Full.
I'm not sure if it is better than an ADC maker for the extra effort involved.
Now she takes this smaller version with her wherever she goes so she can have her favorite coffee when she travels.
You go with the same brand, to try to get one as close to the one you had, as you can.
I like it.So now, the old one will be the back-up.
This pot brought all the great coffee flavor I was hoping for, but not until I managed to pry open the lid.
There are several metal flanges (?) which grip the inner rim of the pot, keeping the lid safely in place.
One of them was incorrectly placed, and I finally managed to fix it after use of pliers and a wrench.
That said, wonderful coffee pot, even with relatively inexpensive ground coffee from the supermarket.
BTW, pot does make some comforting noise while brewing, but unfortunately, not the same perka-perka-perka of the old guys!.
The lid is tight but the spring causes the coffee grounds to fly off.
You save a lot of money on filters and use less coffee with this machine since it recycles the grounds with the water.
It keeps it hot so you can wait a few minutes before pouring it.
I recently purchased a Presto 12 cup percolator based on good reviews to replace this same percolator that I had for 4 -5 years.
Hot coffee and very few grounds.Well, I hated the Presto.
It spewed coffee grounds into the coffee which tasted weird and watery.
I never could seem to get the right amount of coffee to water.
I finally gave in and reordered this model again and haven't regretted it.
I should have just gotten the same one in the first place.
Now I'm back to hot coffee that tastes great and has no grounds.
I'm a coffee lover, and not a snooty one.
Okay, agreed: it might not be the "ideal" way to brew coffee.
But let's be honest, who among us honestly takes the time to cold brew (the BEST method, I think), Aero Press, French Press, etc.
every day?  I 'reserve' these for weekend mornings listening to Weekend Edition, Car Talk, Dr.
Another is the SPEED - the Farberware makes 8 cups in about 8 minutes.
Keep that in mind if you're comparing brew times.The "timer" on the Farberware is JUST RIGHT, too.
It doesn't add to the quality of the brew, but it makes a percolator just a bit more fun, and at least a little nostalgic.
We needed to replace our old 4-cup Farberware Percolator.
By going on Amazon, I was able to find the best deal.
This product is Made in China but I contacted Farberware and they assured me that there is no lead in the product.
I was so impressed with the difference in the taste of the coffee I had to purchase this upon seeing it on Amazon.
It looks great on my counter, and takes up less room than the old 4 cup drip thing.
It doesn't take long to set up at night before bed and all I have to do is plug it in in the morning.
I just let the 5 or so grounds come to the top and I get them out with my spoon.
I think the filters will eliminate that.Overall, I'm loving this cutie!.
Have owned this coffee pot for about a month.
So far it's performing as advertised...brews very quickly.
It sounds like the space shuttle is being launched when you first start it.
My cat runs away when he hears it perking.
LOLI am disappointed to see that Farberware crapped out and is manufacturing in China.
The craftsmanship is obviously inferior to the percolator I owned for 20 years.
It's sad that I'm already anticipating this Chinese perker to die within a year or so.
they last about a good 2 years then the element goes bad not made here USA but it works well.
My aunt said my cousin told her they discontinued it.
She loves percolated coffee more, says regular coffee makers do not keep it hot and burns it.
She was so ecstatic when I sent it to her.
I am about to buy me one too.
After breaking several glass carafes on drip coffee pots I decided to get back to the basics of coffee making.
I chose the Farberware FCP280 8-cup percolator to experiment with.
What a joy!  Good coffee and quickly made.
Easy to clean up and no glass to break.
The only thing I had forgotten about percolators is they are quite a bit noisier than the drip ones.
It sounds like the space shuttle going off but brews quickly so the noise is short-lived.
I agree with the reviewer that said this was not as well made as in the past.
It seems flimsy compared to the older models.
I bought two of these lovely Farberware percolators, one for work and one for home, back in the 1980's and they still work great.
These percs are fast and pretty and classic.
With any perc you should use a rougher grind of coffee and filter paper round, which will reduce the particles in your cup.
First and foremost, this coffee pot is excellent.
Note #1:  Subsequently, Amazon generously refunded the cost of the redundant coffee pot.
Note #2: This percolator coffee pot makes excellent coffee -- especially if you buy Peet's Sumatran.
This is the best coffee pot for your money.
I owned the same pot for 10 years so it was a no brainer to purchase another one.
The coffee pot brews a consistently hot, delicious cup of coffee.
My pot gets a work out day in an day out and never lets me down.
Coffee and Kuerig like systems and I didn't like the way they did not get the coffee hot enough.
You can adjust the amount of coffee in the Farberware to reach the brewed taste that suits you - weak, strong or in between.
I like coffee made from a percolator rather than a drip method.
I wish it percolated just a little longer to make the coffee a littler richer.
We have had a Farberware percolator for many years.
Not only did we get the best price possible, but it included FREE shipping.
If you like your coffee hot and flavorful, this durable and reliable electric coffee maker is the best you will find.
Best part is it is still reasonably priced and made in the USA.
I don't go to Starbucks, or any of the other trendy coffee shops.
But I like a good cup of coffee and for years have been disappointed with drip coffee makers.
Coffee I used before.There is just no comparison between drip-brewed coffee and percolated coffee.
Percolated coffee tastes better and the Farberware FCP240 is perfect for one or two coffee drinkers!.
This is the fourth (or maybe the fifth) Farberware pot we've owned.
When we have company for dinner the 12 cup is just right while the 8 cup would have been too small.
(I use mugs so each serving is really more like 1 1/2 &#34;cups&#34;).The pot is easy to clean and makes great coffee.
what I like best is that the coffee is HOT - not lukewarm like so many of the drip pots.
It also keeps the coffee HOT if you are still working on b'fast and the coffee has finished about 5 minutes before you're ready.
I generally make 8 cups every morning, but the pot works just as well when my husband makes 4 cups.
I bought this item a few years ago to replace a cheapo plastic coffeemaker that made awful tasting coffee when its carafe finally cracked.
It makes great coffee and I anticipate it lasting for years.
I was given a small percolator like this a couple of years ago and she wanted one like it.
Do they make filters for this pot?  Otherwise, it works very well and suits our purpose.
This small unit is perfect for 2-6 cups and makes the same quality cup of coffee as thier 50 cup units.
Perculated coffee is much better tasting than coffe from the more popular drip coffee makers and is just as fast.
It also looks cool on the kitchen counter!.
Hence, cutting  off 3/8" around the outer perimeter of the half-moon shaped filter after folding in half.
Then, while still folded in half, I snip a 1/4" centre notch.
Unfold and slip the filter into the metal bin.
For years I was not satisfied with my morning coffee.
I used to nuke it 30 seconds of so.
This percolator makes the best, I mean the best, cup of coffee I've had going back 30 years.
If you are used to the drip coffee makers, you will find a percolator a bit more work.
But trust me, the coffee will more than make up for the few minutes it takes.
I like this one because it also brews until the coffee is ready, and then stops so you know your coffee is ready.
This is my 3rd Farberware coffeepot in 30 years.
I left one of them on for an entire weekend, and it STILL WORKED afterwards.
Each lasted a long time, eventually just slowing down and making weak coffee, after MANY years of dependable service.
Takes up very little room, makes enough coffee for me and a guest.
YES...It's a quality brand;compact design;can set my watch that in 12 minutes we are having our morning coffee.
Perfect for 2 big mugs and a little left for heat up.
I like the percolator first because I love really hot coffee.
The Farberware percolator also makes the perfect-tasting cup of coffee.
Pricey for me but what other choice do I have?.
Plus, it is easier to store out of sight when not in use.
This is the fifth time have bought this pot.
Farberware 8 Cup Percolator makes really hot coffee.
After the coffee is made, the Farberware 8 Cup Percolator keeps it very hot, wonderfully hot.
Using decent grade coffee, the percolator makes good tasting coffee.
Drink only 2 cups of coffee per week so this is the ideal size.
I have it set up with an appliance timer.
It is done when I get up and 2 hours later it turns off.
No worries!We enjoy the perk coffee so much!.
The first thing my husband said when I handed him a cup of coffee made in this cute little pot is "it's not bitter".
That's been a problem for him, especially with various coffeemakers we've tried (single cup, small drip, & stainless carafe drip).
Most importantly for me, the coffee is smooth & it's hot.
I like a hot cup that's not too strong, but not wishy washy either.
It perks quickly (about 4 minutes) & makes 4 Fiesta mugs, which is plenty for our daily morning needs.
I make sure to never leave the kitchen with it plugged in.
All in all, after using this for a few weeks, I'm very happy with my purchase.
Honestly, this thing is so cute and small.
Beautiful stainless steel and such a nice size.
I don't see it being obstrusive at all at a buffet table or on the dinner table during convo's.
Haven't used it yet, but I don't think it will be a problem.
I grew up loving the smell of percolators' at an elderly woman's home that I loved like a Grandma.
I can't wait to plug it in and be brought back to then.Update: June 20th, 2008Still loving this little percolator.
Brewed very quickly and kept the coffee so very hot.
My Cuisanart grind and brew, which I hated, but it did make a good cup of coffee, finally died.
While researching a replacement coffeemaker I stumbled across reviews for percolators.
The comments about the taste of perked versis drip was interesting and I decided to try a percolator.
All I can say is, I am so glad I did.
The coffee is TONS better than any coffee made by any of my past drip machines.
Coffee is perked rapidly, it is piping hot and very smooth and flavorful.
No problems with speed of brewing, temperature at which the coffee is held, flavor etc....eventually the handle will come apart from the pot.
Seems like all the careful handling in the world won't keep the handle from coming loose.
This is such a great little percolator that I'm getting a second one.
This is perfect for when you don't need a big quantity.
I use it when I want 2 big mugs of coffee rather than use my more expensive k-cups.
This percolator is a simple machine that does one thing really well: it makes a piping hot, evenly-brewed pot of coffee.
This thing blows away my 100 dollar drip machine.
It makes a high-quality brew comparable to the ones you get at coffee shops.
The coffee is never burnt, even if you leave it in the pot too long.
Coffee brews so hot and full of taste that I am always glad I purchased this.
The drip machine never captured the taste of the coffee as well as this little guy.
Some people get faulty machines, I see, but mine has performed well for many weeks now.
The coffee doesn't get re-percolated to keep it warm.
The coffee is very hot, but not boiling when it is done.
I've had one of these for many years and it recently went on the fritz after a LOT of usage.
It can't be beat - and the fact that it's cordless is huge.
You can have a table full of folks for dinner, and walk around freely with your percolator; no unplugging required.
Whereas I agree with those who have commented on this product's durability issues, your experience will depend on the application.
In my case, I brought the coffee pot to work, where I brew one small (6 cups) pot a day.
I haven't had the problems with the programming buttons (cracking and peeling) or the top knob coming off.
I will admit that this pot is rather &quot;dainty&quot; and not recommended for &quot;extreme&quot; home use.
Overall, one of the best cups of home brew I have ever made!.
My husband kept forgetting to turn the old one off so we bought this one.
The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that you can't override the auto shut-off feature for when you are home, etc.
Sometimes because I work a different schedule the coffee is cold by the time I get some.
However, the pot is beautiful, easy to set and easy to clean.
I would definitely buy it again! Recommendation to manufacturer to extend auto-shutoff time to 4 hours rather than 2.
A rule of thumb, coffee snobs will tell you, is that you never ever use a percolator to make coffee.
I don't like presses, they taste funny, and driped coffee is too cold.This is a great machine.
It features contemporary styling, ease of use, and is full featured.
I bought this unit as a replacement for a Rival programmable cooker that came with a non-fit cover and punched out 'feet'.
The Farberware slow cooker has been a delight to use.
I have made beef stew, baked beans, soup and even a sinfully moist chocolate cake.
The cover is a tight fit and the metal ring around the rim assures a vapor seal, preventing moisture loss.
Of particular note are the settings: Low, High and Auto.
The Auto function heats the unit to the High setting and then automatically shifts to the Low setting.
This assures a quick heating of the unit and discourages the possibility of food contamination from bacteria.
Aesthetically, the cooker will look great on your counter with its polished steel body and sleek black insert.
One word of caution, however: the outside does get hot so you will want to keep it out of the reach of the kids.
The handles stay cool, but if you have to move it, you may want to use hot pads just to be safe.
I did quite an extensive search/comparison for a slow cooker and found that this one had the best rating.
So I got it, used it, and I love it.
The ease of a slow cooker is great, and this one works wonderfully.
The lid is great too because it's clear, heavy and fits well.
It looks nice on the counter too, if you intend to keep it there.
You can put a whole chicken in there and the meat always comes out moist and tender.
It cooks slowly what else? I put roasts, ribs, pork shoulder, anything that needs a long time to cook, and 6-7 hours later its done.
I work nights and I start the dinners in the morning and by dinnertime my family has a great hot meal.
They are shocked at how tender and delicious tough cuts of meat become.
This bait has got to be the most foul smelling stuff in the world(maybe skunks).
Woks extremely well at attracting flys but highly recommend using away and up wind from where you might want to be.
THIS STUFF STINKS! But then that is why it works so well to attract flys.
Be sure to wear rubber gloves when working with it or else you will smell like s*** until it wears off.
I put this outside in the winter, just to see if I would get any flies.
Maybe I'm pulling some over from the dairies and chicken ranches in California.
:)You know when the flies are favoring the fly trap over the dog poop, it must be good bait.
I can't imagine there are any ingredients in it that are useful for much else.
But the expense seems to be an industry standard.
In the summer, when the flies are marinating at a simmer, getting within 15' is not advisable.
In the winter, I rarely detect the smell from further away than a few feet.Contrary to another reviewer's opinion that this smells like laundry detergent.
Or any that I would want to use.
To put it mildly, this vile product smells like rotting dead things and decomposing feces.
It's like a little slice of fly Heaven!.
I put it in a plastic jar sold on here as a trap.
Nice to capture the big ones so more do not keep coming.
OLD: I have not used the bait as yet.
If it is the same as what was supplied with the fly trap bottle it is weak.
When I replaced the bottom wrapping with black tape the fly trap worked perfectly with new bait.The fly trap is excellent.
The plastic bag is strong.I have noticed that it is best not to hang the fly trap in direct sun.
I think the UV kills the bacteria in the bait over a few days, It could also be caused by heat buildup.
They eventually tie and fall into the putrid muck at the bottom of the jar where they drown.
I bought the Quart size bottle used with this bait.
I hung it up outdoors by the garbage can...it's completely full in a week with what must be at least 500 - 800 dead flies.
The good news is, there's no longer flies buzzing around the doors of my house waiting to get in.
After two days, only a couple of flies.
I'm not sure what the 1 star people did wrong, but this stuff is fantastic.
I bought the large fly trap, filled it 1/2 way with water and within a day I had 50+ flies.
disgusting, but incredibly effective.The packets are expensive, so I use about 1/3 of a packet per use rather than an entire packet.
Still works great and lasts 3x as long (if I did the math right).
:)My kiddos even made me a little award, "World's Best Fly Killer!".
It's BAIT, for Pete's sake! And it works.
Why you ask for twelve more words? Am I supposed to have made some kind of connection with this product?.
It gets the job DUN...DONE!  I have tried apple cider vinegar and does not work as the power pack for the fly trap.
Pretty gross when you go to empty all the dead bugs, and WHEW! does it stink.
They say you can empty the bottle and there will be a residual odor that still attracts.
I guess it does, but it's nothing like the first batch, the catcher was really full that time.
I've been using my chef model KM201 which is essentially the same as the one currently available since 1996.
I lucked out and got it at Walmart for $75.
Only because I had seen it in the Chef's catalog did I have any idea what a powerful machine this would be.
Actually mine has the Rival logo on it, but it is the very same machine.
It has the 5 quart bowl, the K beater, the dough hook, and the balloon whisk.
Mostly I have used the K beater and the dough hook.I have used it for making bread, cakes, and cookies.
The French bread recipe in the recipe booklet is terrific.
It may not have done that if I'd had sense enough to change to the dough hook when adding the coconut.
Anyway, even the reset button was of no use, but my handy husband was able to take it apart and repair it.
However, I've seen that complaint about other planetary motion mixers so I guess I'll just have to live with it.
That's the only reason my rating is only 4 stars instead of 5.
Bosch does an excellent job mixing, kneading, and whipping and they last forever without any problems.
Yes, I know, it costs $100 to $150 more than the Kitchen Aid.
I have both and I find I use the Kenwood more often.
Why? Ease of use is reason number one.
I mix pumpkin bread dough in the Kenwood and it doesn't even struggle in the least.
The same dough would kill a mere mortal mixer and really makes the Kitchen Aid struggle.
The attachments are hard to find and more expensive when you do find them.
I love this mixer!  It is SO much better than a Kitchenaid.
The motor is much more powerful and more versatile because of its many speeds and pulse mechanism.
It's a great choice!  After many years, it still works like it was brand new and I have never had a problem with it once.
My mother bought a chef back in the 1960's and it is still doing duty in her kitchen.
When I got married it had to be on the list of wedding gifts.
Although this is an expensive mixer, the price is worth it.
They are strong and reliable.I use mine for mixing bread, pastry, cakes, cookies, whisking sponges, beating eggs and cream, making frosting.
The liquidizer/Blender is in constant use, you cant get a better way to make breadcrumbs or to puree vegetables and soup.
The basic animal is good enough to sell it.
The add ons are what make it versatile and exciting.
It's easy to use, quite powerful, and the flour, etc.
It has such a large capacity that it makes the job a ton smoother.
We had a plastic one that served us well for 10 years.
It broke & decided to go metal with it's replacement.
This a great colander, it's made in India which is of good quality.
I originally bought this for a co-worker for a wedding gift and liked the looks of it so much I bought one for myself.
Sure am glad - it's used almost daily in our house.
I've seen a lot of colanders and personally, they're all about the same.
What makes the Amco Colander better than others is that it uses standard sizes and they're known for their high quality steel.
This is one of those where you can substitute for a cheaper product but if you got the money, go for it.
The Amco 6-quart Stainless-Steel Colander is an excellent buy.
The colander is made of quality steel and feels very sturdy.
The handles have a good, solid grip and the stainless steel is a good thickness.
I find the 6-quart size to be about right for most general purposes and it provides a little extra room for larger jobs.
Quality this item gets five stars, the only thing I found to be lacking was the holes.
Generally speaking, this is the best price and quality you can get for a stainless steel colander.
Definitely recommended.UPDATE 5/19/10:  The Amco 6-quart Stainless-Steel Colander is still going strong.
While I am still happy with my purchase, the lack of proper holes for draining is more of an issue now.
Some models have leg supports, but this is a solid piece all the way around it.
With minimal holes in the bottom and a solid support, the water can build up in the sink.
For the price and quality, I still recommend the item, but it verges on the three to four star rating.
I used to have this same or similar wok 20 years ago.
(It took me 40-45 minutes to pre-season the entire wok.) When I finished I had a beautiful darker wok.
Then I poured in a quart or more of soapy water and swished steel wool around in it using chopsticks.
Then I rinsed that out and dried it.
All that was left after that was the SEASONING.
It usually takes only a very, very light scrub (and takes about 15-30 seconds) to fully clean the wok.
I have had a few woks in the past.
First...Highly recommend a round bottom, with the stand.
It creates much better heat for cooking with a  wok, they way it is in intended.
Second, you NEED to be sure to season this wok well before you use it.
If you do this, i dont see how this will not last a long time.
Dont worry about it changing color or looking beat up, if seasoned right, it will work well every time.
You have to season it from time to time though, that's my only beef with these pots.
it is important to season it right but I've been using it non stop since I first got it.
I haven't cooked with it, seasoned it or washed it yet.
My first impression is it's good looking, it appears to be well made.
It's heavier than I expected; the metal is thick.
It's the heaviest wok of four or five I've owned.
The helper handle makes more sense now, considering the weight of the wok.
I won't be flipping this one.Now I've owned it a while and used it several times.
The wok is well made but it doesn't get hot enough on my American gas stove.
I tried turning the ring upside down but that didn't work.
It's a high quality piece of cookware that just doesn't work on my stove.
I guess eventually I'll try the flat bottomed 14 inch wok as is recommended by many for American stoves.
I'm beginning the think the real problem is the stove just won't give enough heat and no wok will work very well.
For now, my cast iron skillet works better than a wok but I don't like it's weight or shape so much, for stir frying.
The wood handle stays cool and makes cooking easier because I do not have to wear oven mittens.
I have an electric stove and it transfers heat evenly.
I could not believe how hard it is to find an authentic wok.
Most of them are the non-stick kind or the electric ones.
This one is fine carbon steel and should last forever.
It must be seasoned first and the directions are included.
I had to buy a ring and a lid separately.
More recently after seeing a video on wok seasoning and care I brought my wok back into service.
I learned that proper seasoning and maintenance is actually easy when you incorporate it into your cooking experience.
I've been making some of the tastiest meals I've ever cooked in this wok, and rust is a thing of the past.
Do all your food prep before heating the wok because you will be cooking fast.
Also be aware that the hot oil vapors can flash fire, so be careful.
My wok is now a primary cooking implement and I've purchased the ladle and spatula to make it easier and faster to cook with.
I rarely buy chinese takeout anymore because I cook it my way now.
The wok is also great for reheating stir fried leftovers.
So begin with proper seasoning and be adventurous and experience foods in a beautifully delicious way.
I've had this wok for about a year now and it has performed well.
Make sure to season it/wash it properly so that it lasts a long time.
Its heavy and large, with firm wood handles.
Works great on my gas stove top without any sort of attachment to the stove.
I wish my stove got as hot as a real wok cooking stove.
You're going to cook a lot of Asian food after getting this!I've attached pictures showing it after a years use.
Great buy really for anyone that enjoys wok cooking this is awesome.
Very good quality I am very happy with my purchase.
This Wok was pretty much what I expected and hoped for.
The rounded bottom does mean that you will need to buy a stand for it, but also allows for more authentic cooking styles.
If you are looking for a good wok, this is your wok.
use it very often and it works great.
It's a round solid bottom carbon steel wok.
The handles are solid and well made so far.
So it keeps all the stars.I had an non-typical sized 13-inch Chinese cast iron wok for 2 years.
14 inch makes a lot of difference in the volume but still fit reasonably into my twin kitchen sink.
My typical wok ring is for 14 inches and above.
It was slightly too large for my old wok.
Carbonized food residue can integrate with the cast iron or come off in trunks.
I think carbon steel should be better.I would have got the small steel loop handles if they are not more expensive including shipping.
For seasoning I can put the whole wok in the oven or the gas barbecue.
Also, wood will break down sooner than metal, right?  Without the wood handles, it could fit better in the sink.
However, the wood handles are much more convenient than without.
I can happily live with it.The wok comes with a clear protective lacquer.
The boiling, hot soapy water, and abrasive pad helps to remove most or all of it.
I don't know if there's something special about my hand dish detergent - Palmolive pure & clear ultra.
When the undiluted detergent make contact with the wok surface, the surrounding area seems to have lacquer still on it.
And before the lacquer comes off completely, wiping the wok with kitchen paper towel will result in greenish color on the paper.
I would dry the wok first completely before adding oil for example.
If you don't do that during seasoning, a proper stir fry will do that for you (unevenly though).
The sturdy wood handle is great to manoeuvre the wok to get some brown color on the side.
I didn't remember if it is in the instructions.
For the oven seasoning method I used to put oil on both sides.
For this one I just smear oil on the bottom and put it under the stove, normal side up.
Some years ago, I tossed out the grungy wok i bought in Chinatown and replaced it with a fancy flat-bottomed stainless steel one.
And the steel just didn't conduct the heat to my satisfaction.
Carbon steel may be a pain to season, but it's still the best conductor of heat for stir-fry.
The design is quite pleasing, and I love the wooden handles, because I don't have to reach for a potholder when I'm cooking.
Although the instructions don't tell you what kind of oil to use for seasoning, I suggest peanut oil.
I started with some corn oil and it blackened, but it scrubbed off and I started again.
I LOVE this WOK - purchased it a few years ago at another outlet.
Cleanup is easy - you clean it right away and you are ready to go.
MUST be oiled to preserve the quality...that takes about one minute to clean and oil.
My husband and I decided to try the vegetarian life 6 months ago and I was learning how to make a good veggie/tofu stir-fry.
I had a 30-year-old small basic wok that was unseasoned carbon steel like this one, but light weight.
But after seasoning this, which I followed the nicely detailed directions, it has been a workhorse in my kitchen.
I can stir-fry enough vegetables for two meals, and store one for later use.
You have to take good care of it, meaning keeping it seasoned (oiled) on the inside or it will rust.
That rust easily comes off with a little scrubbing and more oiling.
If you don't want that trouble, buy a coated one, but this is the authentic deal.
Mine survived fine.First, stove-season the wok per the instructions, concentrating on the bottom.
Wrap the small handle in a wet dishcloth or wet paper towels, then wrap the wet cloth completely in aluminum foil.
Re-wet and re-wrap the cloth keeping the handle cool.
Dry with a paper towel and heat briefly over medium to medium-high heat to remove any remaining moisture.
I really like using it to cook oriental dishes.
The previous one I owned didn't have the wood  handle, and I'm glad I have it.
It makes serving from the pan much  easier.Flat bottom vs round.
I used to have round bottom pan, but the  gas stove I have now recommended not using a wok ring.
Least ways not one  which retains the flame/heat.
After having used both for a while, I can say  it doesn't seem to matter much.
By having a flat bottom pan, its one less  thing to thing to hassle with.
Also at the high  tempetatures I cook things at, it seemed like a non stick surface wouldn't  hold up.
This process  splatters the oil a lot and the deep bowl of a wok keeps it in the pan.
Its really hot on the bottom of the pan,  and much less so up at the edges.
Makes it easier to control the  cooking.This isn't a first fry pan for a kitchen, at least not mine.
High carbon steel seasons well (a process by which you impregnate the steel with a layer of oil.) Follow the directions.
Never wash a wok with detergent or put it in the dishwasher.
We scrub ours out with coarse salt and follow with hot water, a swipe of a paper towel and then a bit of cooking oil.
To cool the wok, remove from the electric element; for gas, just adjust the gas level.) 4.
The handle is also not traditional but handy and well made.In short, you can't find a better wok.
High carbon steel WON'T rust if you take care of it according to directions.
And it cooks better than non-stick surfaces, which should not be heated as hot.
I wanted something that wasn't bulky and heavy.
Meets my needs very well; easy clean, lightweight; fits both my woks (I have 2 different sizes.).
This item will allow the heat to flow freely from your stove top to your wok, for quicker cooking, and greater control.
This is a nice, well made wok ring.
It is much lighter weight than I had hoped and so isn't quite as steady on my stove - slides around a little.
I think it would be better for a smaller wok but it's not really very stable with a 14" one.
I will probably use it as a stand.
I do like the design which allows for the flame to hit evenly on the entire bottom of the wok.
It's make of polished stainless steel so is easy to clean when you slop something on it.
I had my doubts about a wok ring that looked so unsubstantial, but I was wrong.
This ring is light weight, being mostly air, but supports my wok perfectly and is easy to handle.
Such a totally practical device! And this pan is very easy to clean, unlike some of the others with those grid-like bottoms.
It is not inexpensive, but then you get what you pay for.
One of the nicest things to happen to cheesecake baking since the advent of the food processor.
Many people see cheesecake-baking as a frightening art second only to souffle-baking in its mysteriousness and perils.
However, with the right pan it's incredibly easy.
For me, the Kaiser La Forme springform pan is that pan.There are several things about cooking cheesecake that can get tricky.
The Kaiser La Forme pans are heavy-gauge steel that distributes heat evenly.Another potential problem is dripping.
This is extremely unlikely to happen with a Kaiser La Forme pan.
Also, as long as you use a thin layer of butter to grease the pan before filling, the cheesecake will come up fairly easily.
My wife has been using this pan at least once a month for several years.
It is heavy duty - no dings, no dents no warping - it still looks new (well, almost)  It cooks evenly and cleans up easily.
I've only had a chance to use this pan once, but I was happy with it.
Overall, well worth the money in my opinion.
Kaiser LaForme Nonstick Springform pans are the best pans for making cheesecake.
Since recipes vary, you may want to check the size you will need.
The 9-inch springform pan would be used for a large cheesecake.
I love mine for making New York-style cheesecake.
The bottom of this pan can be used for a serving plate but be sure to use a plastic server or spatula.
The heavy nonstick coating on this pan makes clean-up easy! Highly recommended!.
I bought this pan to use with my new "Junior's CheesecakeCookbook" and I'm so glad I did.
This is a very well-madenon-stick springform pan which has a unique design thatprevents it from warping and leaking.
The cheesecaketurned out just like the picture in the book - perfect!It's an expensive pan, but quality doesn't come cheap;it should last a lifetime.
This is a "must have" panfor cheesecake and I highly recommend it.
I have been using my Kaiser springform pan for several years.
The pan was recommended to me by a cooking instructor.
It is great because it has a nonstick coating and it does not leak.
Many of the less expensive ones, rust, and mar up when you cut on it with a knife.
In fact, the pan touts itself as being cut proof.
I also like that my pan seems to hold a very tight seal, that is wonderful when making a cheesecake that requires a waterbath.
All in all this pan is well constructed, and will give you many years of service.
I have several of the Kaiser La Forme cookie sheets and products.
They are all fantastic, easy to clean, and very sturdy.
This is a nicely sized, heavy duty cookie sheet with a non-stick surface that bakes biscuits and large pizzas great.
But, since the non-stick baking surface itself is not effected, it is not a major problem.
Everyone can use a new cookie sheet right.
Especially if I can get a $17+ cookie sheet for around $7.
If their cookie sheets look anything like mine do after a year, I'm sure they will appreciate a new one.
I purchased two of the La Forme 10x14 cookie sheets in 2004 and they still work like a charm.
Despite some minor discoloration the surface is still completely non-stick; not bad for something we have used almost every day for the past three years.
Not only does the nonstick coating hold up well to everyday use it continues to clean up easily.
We use them to bake biscuits, cookies, rolls, pastries and the pans conduct heat evenly and everything we bake on them has come out great.
When baking cookies being able to bake 16 per sheet instead of 12 is ideal because it gets me out of the kitchen faster.
Great purchase - I would buy them again without hesitation.
& the good height to allow me to make raw vegan cheesecakes.
You get all the personal flavor in a personal size.
The quality of the metal seems to be really good.
I have not & will not bake in them soon.
I just use them in freezer for cheesecakes.
Got this for my girlfriend who just started a baking business and she loves it and says there are no problems with it.
I bought these to make mini cheesecakes for xmas gifts.
I didn't have any problems like some of the other reviewers with rust, but then again I washed and dried by hand.
I only plan to use these a few times/year and they are obviously up for that task and well worth the price.
My review is based strictly on the use for which I purchased these springform pans - shaping and raising my own bagels.
These pans are simply perfect for use with 6 oz.
With the mini-layer pans, the holes in the bagels closed during raising.
Even though I was able to "poke" through them during the boiling phase, the hole closed almost completely during the baking phase.
Using a 9" X 13" cake pan resulted in the bagels raising into and joining each other.
I hand washed the pieces before using them and have not put the pans in the dishwasher yet.
I line each pan with a square of parchment before covering them and putting the bagels in the refrigerator to raise.
Thus, I cannot comment on whether these are truly nonstick.
They are strictly used for molds for shaping and raising bagels.
In my opinion and for that purpose, they are a five-star product.
There are times I will make a primary batch of cheesecake filling and then divide it up for different additions.
These mini springform pans are perfect for doing this and giving each person their own.
These pans make a nice size for two people or works well for small items for a party.
The quality seems to be good, only time will tell about this.
When I found a recipe for mini-pumpkin cheesecakes, I knew I had to buy some mini-springform pans.
The nonstick feature on this set makes them perfect for any recipe.
When you receive them, you will think they are the most adorable kitchen item you have ever seen.
For a party, you might want to order more than one box.
These pans fit nicely on a baking sheet and you could bake six to a sheet.
Just keep the temperature the same and decrease the time.
The recipe I have was in the Sunset magazine and called for 10 "tart" pans (4 1/2 inch wide with removable rims).
I've never used springform pans before this and I'm pleasantly surprised how well they work.
I'm not much for making cheesecake because of watching weight, but banana breads and carrot cakes come out well with these.
I hesitated to buy these because of a review that said they aren't durable.
I wanted these because cooking a 9-inch dessert for two is too much.
I guess you can halve or quarter a standard recipe and reduce the cooking time to fit the 4.5-inch pan.
A warning: if you make four of these at once, you don't save any calories over one 9-inch dessert.
Kaiser would help themselves and their customers if they supplied proper recipes.After writing this review, I ordered "Small-Batch Baking" by Debby Maugans Nakos.
I got this pan for making cheesecakes in a 5 quart round crock pot.
It's a great size for one or two people.
(Standard recipes and pan sizes always make waaaaay too much for the small household.)I generally like Kaiser products.
Very good German engineered quality!  The BMW of bakeware.
I had some other springform pans that were useless and they went into the trash.
I know that I will be getting lots of use out of this.
I was looking for a small spring form pan so I could cook for two.
It can be reversed for left or right hand closure, cleanup was simple.
I would highly recommend this springform pan to anyone!.
I purchased this pan to make cheese cake in my pressure cooker.
It fits in my 6 quart cooker perfectly.
Not too much you can say about a baking pan.
This seems to be quality construction from Germany.
It was a little pricey but seems to be worth the money.
Baked with it and there were absolutely NO leaks, which is how this pan should perform.
I bought this for a specific baking project.
This pan is really well-made and I used it to bake cheesecakes.
I bought this based on reviews from America's Test Kitchen, and they didn't steer me wrong.
I hand wash it, and use just a cloth to wipe it.
No scouring, so the finish is still intact.
I'm thinking about getting another one, only because I'm often making 2-3 cheesecakes for the holidays.
I just happened to have croissant dough on hand when the springform arrived (on time), and decided to make a cinnamon coffee cake (princess ring).
It seems that most of the negative reviews I read about this product were a result of the reviewer, not the item itself.
Just make sure all your items are approximately the same price.
I have been an owner of this spring form pan for about five years now.
This pan will last a you a long time.
I love to make one time purchases, and this pan is my one time purchase when it comes to a pan to make cheesecakes in.
Sturdy, and firm, this pan will last you a lifetime.
This is a a good heavy spring-form pan as advertised.
The cheese cakes I have made in it have not leaked and cooked evenly.
It also has a small rim around the outside edge that catches any grease that may seep out.
Have a lot of spring-form pans and this is one I will use most often.
This pan is the best cheesecake pan I've used.
My cheesecakes bake evenly and NEVER leak (I bought it to replace one that cost the same amount but leaked all over my oven).
If you spray Pam on the base before making the crust, it will easily come off so you can put it on a serving plate.
I used a flat, flexible frosting spatula and slide it under the cheesecake to release it, then gently push it onto a plate.
Wash the pan right away before anything gets stuck to it, and you won't need more than a regular sponge.
Don't let the springform part soak - the metal bracket can rust.With proper care this pan should last for a long time.
the cookie sheet does bend in the oven but gets back to its shape when it cools down.
I just got it today and tried it out baking some cookies.
They work as advertised with regards to not burning the bottom of the cookies.
As compared to my other two cookie sheets, the bottom of the latest batch of cookies came out perfectly golden brown.
My previous cookie sheets use to come out very dark/burnt brown.
If I reduced cooking time with my previous cookie sheets, the cookies seemed and tasted not fully cooked.
Cookie does not burn or stick to pan.
It is much more expensive than other cookie sheets that I purchased.
No warping, no stick, and a good solid feel.
I have had these before and they last for decades, very sturdy mechanism.The only thing is that it may not look pretty for long.
Instead, just try to clean it as soon as you are able to remove the cake.
I got a good deal on the pan so I don't mind that it may not win a beauty contest.
This pan came quickly and was well packaged.
I have had none of the problems that I read in the reviews.
It works perfectly and although I've not put it in the dishwasher I've had no problem with rust and I've used it several times already.
I just wash it as soon as I'm done using it and then dry it right away.
The quality of this pan was much better than I expected for the low price.
I made my very first no bake cheesecake with this wonderful  10 x 2 Kaiser Springform pan.
I sprayed the sides and used parchment paper on the bottom.
I was worried that my cake would stick; well it did not stick at all.
The cheesecake popped out with ease and it was beautiful and delicious.
This pan turns out a very nice size cheesecake for entertaining.
I'm an avid baker, lots of cheesecakes! I have probably 7 springform pans in different sizes, high end companies & a couple cheaper brands.
I have to admit, this is the first one than not only baked superbly, it also cleaned up like a breeze.
In a couple of mine, the crust of the cakes frequently &#34;cakes&#34; up in that groove where the disc meets the wrap around part.
I just ran hot water around that groove and the solids just popped right out.
They wash well in the dishwasher and like I said, bake phenomenally.
I think the positives may be due to the shiny material.
Looks like I will be replacing my other 7 going forward.
My mistake was the height of the pan.
I should have ordered a 3&#34; deep pan.
None the less it worked great with a little adjustment on my part.
The sides released welll and the cheesecake lifted from the base with no problems.
I like the pan and would recommend it.
This thermometer has been good to me for oven use, and was my first one.
I loved being able to set a timer and do other things without worrying about checking the meat all the time.
I'm going to try the Webber probe for my grilling, and hopefully it will live up to it's 500 degree maximum.
I purchased one of these when I hosted my first Thanksgiving two years ago.
It has gotten me through four Turkeys, and an uncountable number of other large pieces of meat.
It's so nice to be able to put something in the oven and walk away until that shrill beep brings you back.
I purchased mine at a Restaurant Supply Store in Seattle, which does sell replacement probes.
Also don't let the cord or probe body touch oven elements, racks or pans.
If using in a grill, don't put the probe in the food until near the time when you think it will be done.
I've only used it once so far, but it worked fantastic.
Cool product!  It's a great timer besides the thermometer.
I was wondering why my probe went up to 177 degrees all of a sudden.
Apparently, it was because I submerged it in water.
400F seems to be the extreme max according to the packaging, but > 392F will deteriorate the life span faster, says the instructions.
I've seen it go as low as 39F for refridgerated water; it could probably handle lower.
There's a switch on the bottom to measure in Celcius.
392F may be low for some people, so be warned.
I haven't compared it to another thermometer/probe, so I don't know how calibrated it is, but it seems to be reasonable for my purposes.
For those of you without metal oven doors like me, it rests nicely on the countertop.
I do find the wire a bit gangly.
Oh, and the alarm is loud (which can be good or bad).
Then I broke the silly thing permanently when I dropped it to the floor while cooking.
(I proceeded to destroy another analog dial probe forgetting that not all probes are made alike - the face melted in the oven.
It was never meant to be kept inside the oven.
I got spoiled with the Pyrex.) I never realized how much I relied on this thing until it was gone.Our Pyrex probe was awesome.
It did exactly what we wanted it to do.
I like how the alarm goes off when it reaches the temperature you desire.
And because the main unit stays outside the oven, I don't have to worry about opening the door and letting the heat out.
My foods never came out undercooked when I used the probe to the temperatures I needed.
But it's not enough to make me not want to buy another Pyrex probe.
In fact, I think I'm going to buy this also as part of a wedding gift.
It's been used for both indoors and outdoors cooking - and it's been left out in the rain several times (thanks, hubby).
It gets flaky a bit after getting wet (no kidding) but comes out like a champ when it dries.
Still haven't had the need to replace it.
I've been using a digital oven probe thermometer for several years now.
It's a must-have and provides peace of mind for newbies and the most seasoned cooks.
I love that I can use the countdown timer when not using the probe.
My previous digital oven probe did not have that feature and it didn't have an on/off switch.
It came on when the probe was plugged into the base unit.
I often left the probe plugged in only to find dead batteries the next time I went to use it.
Conveniently the Pyrex has an on/off switch.I highly recommend getting one but with a few caveats.
Just wash the tip with soap and water or use a gentle scrubbing pad.
Probes are hard to replace and almost as expensive as the original cost when you add s&h.;One place on amazon sells them for $10.
I just replace the entire unit.My older unit displayed wrong temps and poor/scrambled read-out displays when the probe wire was wet.
This also protects the cord from becoming a cat toy if you have a cat.
Cats and dogs are scavengers and they can smell food particles on the cord.
That can be costly and you end up with many units but only one working probe.
You might repair chewed up cords but their accuracy will be affected.
How did I live without it? I ate mostly overcooked food!Which is to say, I've not had a problem with it so far!.
I don't take any extra special care of it and this product has worked perfectly every time.
Gave as a gift to my families' kitchens last year - great and inexpensive gift - perfect for every kitchen.
I have this timer, the CDN big display timer (TM23-S), and the AMCO double digit timer.
The CDN is poorly laid out for setting the clock etc.
but at least has direct input for the numbers.
this is not a big advantage for me.
The CDN and AMCO are too bulky.I would gladly trade the AMCO plus the CDN for one Pryex.
For aging folks like me, or for younger but farsighted folks: this thing is SMALL.
Get out the granny glasses &amp; be careful about the twitchy old fingers, lolol.
In spite of all that, I'm ordering another one of these very handy timers.
Wouldn't recommend (nor would the manufacturer recommend, I'm sure) dropping this gadget on a concrete floor then stepping on it.
but as I said, it really IS a bit too small.
I have had this timer for maybe 4 years.
It is handy for more things than you would expect.
It is true that the beep is not very loud.
I have dropped it several times on linoleum, and innumerable times on carpeting, and it has never broken.
I find it very easy to use.The four different alarm settings are very useful if you're cooking more than one thing at the same time.
I chose this little timer because of the Pyrex name.
I was disappointed when it arrived -- I thought it would be larger.
Then I used it and fell in love.
I have an old, old oven with a dial timer that is murder to set.
This little guy was easy to set and has a cheerful chirpy little alarm.
bought this years ago and it's still sittin on my desk right in front of me, used nearly daily.
4 different timers on it, which I've used for different ebay auctions sometimes.
this has just been a seriously useful little thing for us.
I had been considering several metal measuring cup sets but ended up trying these.
Lexan is an excellent choice of material for the kitchen and gives the cups a quality feel.
The tapered sides and generous radius on bottom edge make for easy hand washing.
The halfway line molded into every size (no markings to rub off)  is extremely thoughtful and my favorite feature.
In the past, to measure 1/4 cup of orange juice I would fill a 1/4 cup to the brim and it would end up overflowing.
If there is one thing that is not perfect, it's the hook that's provided to hang the cups with.
They have a 2/3 and a 3/4 cup size, I hate having to do two 1/3 cups or a 1/2 and a 1/4.
And each cup has a halfway mark line which is very handy, esp for the 1/4 cup showing a 1/8 cup.
Perfect when you have to halve a recipe.
I've recommended these to everyone.UPDATE: I've now had these for 8 years and just today I marveled again how great they are.
They are only slightly scuffed and still the half markings and see-throughness make them awesome.
As Sylvia stated above, pouring lips are really the only thing that would improve this set.
All other reviews indicate how great this set is and I have to concur.
Even the paddle for hanging the set works just fine for me.
Okay maybe one suggestion:  I think the taper could be a little less.
If the bases were a little wider, they would be more stable.
Only one thing left desired in this set of measuring cups: no spout for pouring or lip to make it easier to scoop up flour/sugar.
Others have remarked that they were too thin but they seem to be the ideal weight to me.
I'm enjoying mine for salads but they will work well as a serving utensil, too, for breads or cookies, etc.
I use them all the time, mainly for salad.
I am so glad I ordered this, as I use it all the time to serve many foods at the table.
I like it better than a meat fork for sliced roast and chicken, and it's a good salad server - just the right size.
I sometimes grab it for cooking, too, when a long narrow cooking tongs is too much.
I found nothing else quite like it and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
You can add a cherry garnish in this martini if you like.
Useful,m good quality and at the same time pleasent to the eyes.
The high gloss finish looks classy and is easy to take care of.
I like my Martinis, Manhattans, etc, cold--I keep it in the freezer and when called to duty it performs at a 100 percent level.
I do not know what more I could ask of it.
(Well engineered--the three parts fit together perfectly and it looks good too.).
We bought this popcorn popper 6 months ago, and it is used every night in our house.
It has performed flawlessly!  If anything ever happened to it, I would buy another one immediately.
My 10 yo kids can run this and clean it themselves.
They think it's fun, and it's healthier than teflon-coated microwave popcorn.
I recommend using coconut oil with this for best flavor that's also healthier than butter.
If you don't think microwave or air popped corn is the real thing, this is the best popper around.
Only realize that they don't last forever (we get about 5-6 years out of ours with heavy use).
Also, this latest version has a different shaped bowl which is inferior to the previous one which was flat on the bottom and more stable.
So we just use our old one which fits perfectly on the base.
The result is a *much* higher percentage of popped corn in comparison to microwaved varieties as well as the homemade kind on the stove top.
I had *perfect* movie popcorn in about 3-4 minutes.
We had maybe 4-5 kernels that didn't pop...everything else came out perfectly, and I only use bulk-bin popcorn from Whole Foods (no gourmet, or anything).
I just received this popper and gave it a test run.
I agree with the reviewer  that said to check the stirring wand to make sure it doesn't rub the non-stick finish.
This would address the complaints that some others have expressed.
My only negative comment would be that the bowl could have been made a little more sturdy, other than that it's great.
I choose this while looking for a Whirley Popper.
The Stir Crazy seems more durable and easier to use.
glad I got this one!West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popperot.
The West Bend Stir Crazy popcorn popper is the best electric popcorn popper on the market, in my opinion, and I've owned others.
I bought one at Target about three years ago.
Somehow the cord got separated from the popcorn popper (a word to the wise.
I'll find that cord one day and then I'll have two popcorn poppers:-)  The West Bend Stir Crazy Popcorn Popper makes great popcorn.
I prefer it over the air popper I used to use before switching to the Stir Crazy.
It really doesn't get any simpler than that.I've read that other people have had problems with their machines breaking after one or two uses.
The bowl is simple enough, but the machine obviously can't be submerged in water.
We love popcorn, and this baby is great.
A cup of corn and this this is a hit.
It's our go to snack when friends are over to play.
Kids never seem to tire of watching it...kinda like the old jiffy pop space thingy.
Easy to clean and yummy popcorn every time.
The cords go bad, the plastic cover will crack and become wobbly but the popcorn is delicious.
I do think that West Bend has upped their workmanship on this particular model.
The plastic cover doesn't seem to be as hard, and in my mind may not crack around the seal like the previous models.
Regardless, i would replace before finding a different popper.
I probably would like to see the &#34;after-care&#34; of the popper made easier.
My sense is that never put/run water over the metal cooker.
Damp soapy cloth to remove the clutter, rinse cloth and repeat until surface is clean.
This may be my fifth because i tried to run water over the metal cooking surface? Nothing seals the electric wiring inside from the moisture.
It pops fast and will pop all the kernel's.
Love the fact that you can use the bowl to eat out of.
The butter drip works well and the popper is easy to clean.
The kids will love it and it makes the house smell good.
I question why I ever used microwave popcorn before.
This popper allows me to make super easy and cheap delicious popcorn in minutes.
I have found this easy to use and it makes great popcorn.
The only thing I don't like is the "butter dispenser" thing.
I melt the butter separately in the microwave (yeah they're good for something) and drizzle on afterwards.
This is a product we had when our children were young.
We were working overseas for several years and left it in Asia for friends.
I have not seen it in stores, so ordered it through Amazon.
It helps us make healthier popcorn (than making it in a microwave) and it is easy to use and clean-up is quick as well.
The popped corn is fluffy, just about all the kernels pop, and at the two-quart level, the job is done within four minutes.
And I can wipe the non-stick surface clean.
I was desperate for a solution, and the &#34;pot&#34; corn didn't taste that good, either.
We love our pop corn popper, so much tastier and healthier then the microwaveable bags of popcorn.
Stir Crazy I have purchased/owned, having purchased the 2nd one based on the great performance of the 1st one purchased years ago.
In between, we tried a hot air popper (The Warden wanted me to eat healthier.
Someone had donated a used "Movie Theater" style popcorn maker and the idea of using it appealed to me.
Appealed that is until the person who had made popcorn in it the year before had the fire dept.
show up twice because the smoke from the burnt popcorn set off the fire alarm.
The thought of the FD showing up was pretty intimidating.
It became apparent to me why is was donated in short order.
I tried it twice and wasted 2 cups of unpopped corn for every cup it made, trying to prevent the alarm from going off.
They did.I purchased one from Amazon.com and had it in short order.
I have used it for the entire school year, making 4 to 8 batches every Friday except for the Holidays.
I use Orville's Buttery Oil and popcorn exclsively.
The Stir Crazy is now made in China instead of Wisconsin and the lid is now frail.
Being careful with is is the order of the day.
I'm ordering a replacement lid as the school year is over.
This will prevent any IED's from surprising you!.
This was a replacement for one like it that lasted for about 15 years.
I looks and works almost like the orginal I bought back then.
I bought this after having popcorn made at a friend's house.
It makes fabulous popcorn if you use white popcorn.
I tried Orville Redenbacher in it, and the popcorn was good but mildly tough.
I then bought a store brand of white popcorn and all I can say is WOW...what a difference.
I highly recommend you try this popcorn popper with white popcorn.
It makes all the difference in the world.
I used 2 tablespoons oil and 2/3 cup of white popcorn seeds and it made a full batch.
If the popcorn is in too deep of a bowl, it doesn't crisp up as much as it cools.
This did not happen when I used the store brand white popcorn seeds.
The popcorn is far superior to either air popped popcorn or microwave popcorn.
Nothing beats the fun of a real popcorn in action, and the taste is the best.
Well designed, both top and cover go in washing machine just fine.
Stirrer makes things a bit easier than those without the feature.
I bought one of these poppers after, getting fed-up with crummy tasting microwave popcorn (Styrofoam popcorn).
As a kid, I was the designated popper/chef at 15 in our house, so I KNOW the good Stuff from crappola.
I used lard, and Jolly-Time seeds, and real butter, and salt.
Animal Fat, and all that bad fat and stuff.Once bought a "Healthy" hot air popper, threw it in the trash after 2 batches.
But the results are: Too greasy, and way too salty.
Also the bags have some sort of toxic residue inside when microwaved, and then there are the preservatives.
Bought a Stir-Crazy after reading about 60 or 70 reviews at Amazon, and ordered one.
BEFORE I filled with seeds, I plugged it in to see if I had one with stirrer problems.
The stirrer pedestal rotated unevenly, causing the stirrer bar to scrape every half-rotation.
Tweeking the bar was no good, the pedestal was rotating unevenly.
I requested a Replacement, and got it in 3 days.
It mechanically functioned OK, so I put in the Orville R.
Very Greasy, many seeds not fully popped, and as chewy as Cracker Jack popcorn.
After 4 more attempts, (not the same night), trying different oil amounts.
I was beginning to believe the Amazon POSITIVE reviews were Bogus Corporate plants by the company that made the popper.
But I saw Jolly-Time WHITE popcorn seeds in a bag, not in a Gourmet jar like Orville's.
Bought the seeds, took them home and tried them.
Fluffy, tasty white popcorn, with minimal oil, and had used minimal seeds.
The seeds are actually a little smaller than Orville's seeds, but pop up bigger than his did.
And this popcorn melted in my mouth, like the good ol tasty Jolly-Time Lard cooked popcorn I remembered as a kid.
It wasn't the popper, or the oil that messed up my original results, it was the seeds.
(They also have YELLOW, but I haven't tried that one yet.)  I don't know how long this machine will last.
The reviews were mixed about that, but reviews leaned more toward long life.
There IS a difference from Microwave, in taste.
And there is that questionable toxic-bag safety factor.
And if you are health conscious, you can reduce the buttery oil, and STILL enjoy a light buttery taste.
And price-wise, Home/machine popped popcorn is way cheaper than microwave.
Jolly-Time popcorn is only 2 bucks a bag.
And I bet I can make easily 18 6-quart batches from one bag.
(I bought the 6 quart capacity machine.) Once you try it, you won't go back to microwave.
Just make sure you get the right seeds.
By the way....don't melt butter in the top.
It affects the popped results of the popcorn adversely.
But if you prefer more buttery taste, melt it in the microwave, and pour on AFTER the popcorn is transferred to the bowl.
I think you will be very happy with your choice.
And with Amazon's quick Return Policy, you can't lose.
They seem to really WANT you to be happy with your purchase.
I may try other brands of seeds too.
I've had this for a couple of years.
It works great and makes amazing popcorn every time.
I purchase these as gifts for people who've visited and love my popcorn.
I recently discovered "coconut oil" and its a great way to pop corn with this popper.
I bought many different poppers,  as I do not like microwave popcorn.
I got a much more expensive one and although it looked cute, it only made a small amt.
It was also a real pain to clean.
Use coconut oil & flavacol and you will have "Movie theater style" popcorn.
Very nice, not always consist when  making  p0pcorn, But a good  price and a handy top to serve it in.
If you love popcorn then you have to get one of these.
It makes the best popcorn especially if you are good at your popcorn recipe.
Amazon reminds me I bought this unit in 2006.
It still works perfectly, but here are some  points to consider.
First of all I never leave the black butter tray on the top when the popping is in progress.
The steam needs to get out to get the crispest possible result.
It's still not quite as crisp as microwave popcorn, but does a good job of popping all the kernels into big fluffy pieces.
I prefer emptying it out into a wooden bowl.
Cleanup is usually just wiping it out with a paper towel after it's cooled.
When it's plugged in it begins heating immediately and the arm starts going around.
It doesn't go fast, just enough to stir the corn as it pops.
I never bother to measure, just look for a single layer of kernels spreading out on the cooking surface.
It pops into the corn and flavors it nicely.
If drizzling butter on afterward is still important to you, I heat the butter in the microwave and pore it on separately.
The butter holder in the top isn't as effective in my opinion.
It's consistent, reliable and simple--and still working perfectly after six years.
Although the popped corn could be a bit crisper, it's good enough that I will stick with this popper and am very satisfied with it.
Great entertainment for my 3 year old too.
Only negative is the amount of time it takes to clean up.
West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper.
We had on a long time ago and it was good.
I planted popcorn in my garden but it is not ready to pop.
We bought this to replace our older Cuisinart Popcorn popper.
Not only was it half the price but actually does a better job popping with hardly any unpopped popcorn.
It also allows us to pop more at one time than the Cuisinart did.
The stirring arm on the floor of this popper keeps the kernels moving continually so they don't stick and burn, even after being popped.
We used years old popcorn we raised ourselves, and there were only two &#34;old maids&#34;.
We don't add butter, but the compartment in the top melts it so you can have it if you want.
it's quick, and easy, and best of all, the lid can become the bowl.
My husband is a popcorn freak, especially during football season, and our old one was just "worn out".
He doesn't like air popped or the microwave packs and this was the upgrade from the one previously used.
The stir rod is nice--very few old maids.
I am a popcorn nut, always striving to make the perfect popcorn.
I special order movie theater popcorn from someplace in Idaho just to get the best.
I have neither the money nor the space for a commercial corn popper (even the home versions of these are big and hundreds of dollars).
When I read about the West Bend Stir Crazy, I had to try it.
I can honestly say it makes the best home popped popcorn I have ever had.
First of all, because of the stirring rod it requires significantly less oil, which is healthier.
It pops a big batch very quickly and with almost no kernels left unpopped.
I have even used grocery store popcorn on occasion with similar results.The machine is very easy to clean.
I have had mine for a year and a half and it is still in excellent condition.
I find that the vents on top do not melt the butter fast enough so I microwave my butter.
The price may seem high, but it's worth it.
This is our third purchase of the West Bend Stir Crazy popper.
The first one we used so much that after years of use the motor just died.
There was no question that our replacement would be the same unit.This unit is great- consistent and easy to use and to clean.
I put in my oil and popcorn, plug it in and go.
You will have a full bowl of popcorn.
I don't know that I have ever had unpopped corn.
That is a personal preference though.Some reviewers say the coating of the unit comes off.
We make popcorn a couple times a week and love this unit.
For the money, you will get a great product that will keep you in perfectly made popcorn for years to come!.
If you are tired of all taste the same micro popped corn and want to get a true popper than this unit is for you.
The Stir Crazy leaves almost no unpopped kernels every time we use it.
The small amount of time spent cleaning up ANY oil popper is well worth the bonus of great tasting popcorn.
The Stir Crazy heats up and starts popping your corn in a very short amount of time.
I recently replaced an Orville Redenbacher Popcorn Popper which I owned for over a year with this Stir Crazy unit.
Quite honestly, both poppers are so similar that they might be interchangeable except for their logos.Operation is easy.
An arm rotates at the bottom of the popper which distributes the popcorn and effectively eliminates the need to shake the popcorn in hot oil.
It is not submersible so I use dampened paper towels to clean and dry the unit.
Because they are made of a hard plastic the bowls seem to be predisposed to hairline cracks.
This unit's bowl already shows fracturing as did my old popper.
The bowl just isn't particularly durable even when it is gently hand washed.
This might not be a huge issue if the bowl wasn't essential to operation.
I've used this popcorn popper just once so far, and it was very easy and straightforward to use and to clean up afterwards.
I've never been a fan of the taste of microwave popcorn so am always looking for a good popper.
Since this is so easy to use, pops quickly, and provides good results, I'll be using it for awhile.
I cannot say enough nice things about this corn popper! It is hands down THE best corn popper I've ever used.
We've had one of these things for year.
And honestly, I really cannot recommend anything else.
Great, great item, used it for years, and am planning on buying another.
I got this back in December, & use it every day.
At first I had unacceptable results with too many unpopped kernels, but that was from using oil that was out of date.
As another reviewer said, it's a good idea to let it warm up while getting & measuring out your oil & popcorn.
One thing I would say is be careful not to put too much butter in the well on top.
While the steam from popping melts it so it drops on the popcorn, too much liquid causes the popcorn to shrivel up.
Just tip it to drain the bowl  first then clean the well area.
Just popped our first batch after this beauty arrived from Amazon.
The 5 star reviews are correct: this thing makes fantastic popcorn.
Air popped popcorn is like chewey cardboard in comparison.We just popped 4 quarts of crisp, fluffy popcorn without a single unpopped kernel.
And we use the plain Safeway brand popcorn! (no additives).This product is a winner.
We bought a microwave popcorn popper that did not work very good.
This pops nearly all of the popcorn up.
An excellent oil popper that will last at least 10 years if it performs as well as my last one.
Use i quite often and my granddaughters love to watch it pop.
First let me address the review about the Teflon wearing off.
However we were just given a new popper a few months ago and the Teflon seemed thicker.
We go through mass quantities of popcorn for two people but in two months it hasn't started to wear so maybe they fixed this now.
The last popper we had that wore off it started right away.
And yes you are right, that isn't good for you so I was hesitant in using this one.
I know that West Bend is no longer really `West Bend'.
The company was sold and is no longer in West Bend Wisconsin.
Maybe a change was made then.The thing is it makes the very best tasting popcorn anywhere and is so easy to use.
We have used this type of popper for at least 10 years, probably closer to 15 or 20 years.
Our first unit quit working last year so we bought another and it works great and just the same.
We use it about 1 x week on the average and it pops all of the kernels, as it stirs as it pops.
You will be less likely to break a tooth.
It is very easy to prepare, use, and clean.
That top still fits this new base but this top is clear and is shaped more like a funnel.
If you stick with the same item (popcorn popper, blender, etc.) you might be able to use the same parts (I notice).
Highly recommended to anyone that wants to make popcorn quick and easy, and if a problem occurs I would buy it again.
I bought this hoping the quality was still good for this unit.
Popped every kernel and I hope it lasts!Use a paper grocery bag to dump the popped corn in and add butter salt and shake.
Be advised all metal parts that directly contact the coating will wear the coating out in that spot.
My 20 year old one did the same thing.
I could melt it and when it is almost done...pour it in where the butter would sit.
I would give this five stars if I didn't have to clean it.
It takes longer to clean than to make popcorn.
I got the theater type oil and topping and the gourmet corn to go with it and it made a great combination.
I was eating popcorn before the UPS guy got out of the driveway.
I purchased this to replace my Whirley Pop I have had for over a year because my boyfriend stole it.
Once he had real popcorn he couldn't go back to microwave but he's too cheap to purchase his own.
Anyhow, I read the reviews, all the bad ones as well, and still made my purchase and I am glad I did.
The popcorn popped up with little to no old maids and that's a huge plus.
My only gripe is the Orville Redenbacher's White Popcorn I purchased but it's not the poppers fault.
I give this a five and recommend to everyone!.
I grew up with one of these and was finally able to convince her to get one.
She hasn't had air popped since.It is simple to prepare: 2 Tbs of any oil (corn, olive, butter, whatever) to 1 cup popcorn.
It pops popcorn quickly and we have never once had a batch that was even a little burned.
If you like butter on your popcorn then it has a section on the top of the bowl where you can put solid butter.
The steam will melt it evenly onto the popcorn as it pops.
To clean up bottom just wipe the oil out.
The top can go in the dishwasher.One thing to keep in mind, the bowl top is plastic and it will not last forever.
Pros: popcorn pops lightning fast, in less than 5 minutes for even a large batch.
It also never burns a single kernel, and leaves relatively few unpopped.
Very easy to clean, with a smooth non-stick finish on the base.
Instruction manual is quite vague, and determining how much and what kind of popcorn to use at one time is a try-and-see ordeal.
This corn popper works quickly and leaves no un- popped kernels.
Since it only requires a tablespoon of oil, it is a healthy snack.I would buy this again.
This is the best corn popper I have ever had, it works good and the corn is much better than the micro oven type.
Most of the kernels pop, even with cheap store brand popcorn.
Am glad West Bend didn't try to improve something that already is perfect.
Even the quality  has not deteriorated that much from 15 years ago.
Had the Sun Beam for over 10  years and the Teflon finally came off.
The thumb screw that holds the metal rod needs to be removed and cleaned too each time you use it or it could harbor bacteria.
My trick to making a perfect batch is to add the oil and preheat it with one kernel in it.
When that pops, add the rest of the corn and put the cover on.
The instructions say to add the  oil and corn at the same time.
Ive always preheated the oil even in pan popping.
Regardless, you will have a perfect batch of popcorn in a matter of seconds, and clean up is quick and easy.
just don't forget to keep the stirring rod and the thumb screw clean too.
I did subtract one star because the power cord is just a bit too short for me.
A little longer and it would be easier to place on the counter top.
This works great as the base of my coffee roaster.
I really like how the arms turn the opposite way when they face too much resistance.
I wish that they replaced some of the plastic parts with metal parts.
My daughter loves to watch it work, and so do I.
But the important point is that it makes great popcorn.
No burn popcorn, not too greasy, just tasty stuff.
A bar we visited on our Caribbean vacation made popcorn every night during happy hour and used a popper similar to this one.
The popcorn was so good (along with the island rum!) that as soon as we got home, we bought this one.
It works great and the popcorn tastes like we remember as kids.
It has a rotating arm that ensures all the kernels pop.
It is large, so it takes up a fair amount of room in the cupboard.
West Bend's "Stir Crazy" is the way to make popcorn.
In a few minutes the popcorn comes out light, with very little unpopped or burnt.
Butter can be placed in the top or butter oil can give the flavor.
We have tried other methods, but none match up.
Works great, is so much cheaper to use this than to keep buying the microwave bags, pops up light and fluffy.
We could not live without our popper....that is our snack each week.
We would never eat processed microwave popcorn, so this is perfect for us.
Since my husband's heart attack and since we learned how to reverse his type 2 diabetes, we avoid *all* food chemicals as much as possible.
We both loved popcorn, but we tossed out the door the chemical laden microwave convenience popping brands.
The past few years we've used theNordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cupand were satisfied.
Once we went through the hassle of replacing our over the range microwave, my husband admitted popping popcorn was very hard on a microwave.
So we were again on the search for a healthful solution to having our favorite healthy snack - popcorn! without destroying our microwave.
I had experienced the delicious popcorn at a friends house, but had never tried one myself.
It came out amazing!  We simply added a small amount of sugar to the above ingredients.
There are a number of other recipes in the West Bend Popper manual that we still intend to try.
We also add a bit of sea salt (good source of trace minerals!) for perfectly flavored popcorn, every time.
I bought one of these a few weeks ago.
I've been using some of the cheapest popcorn I could buy and so far it's popped almost 100% of the kernels.
I've never used a popper that was so efficient.
Right around 5 minutes all the kernels pop during the next 45 seconds and  then it's done.
It is very fast which made it easy to switch from the microwave.
The butter is almost all melted by the time the popcorn is done and the continuous stirring action rotates it so it spreads rather evenly.
Just put on the cover over the butter melter and turn over and it's ready to eat.
It's certainly not the cheapest popcorn popper out there but it works very well.
Even though it uses oil, it's not enough that it leaves it tasting greasy.
I would buy one again.Tip - the stirring rod is removable for cleaning.
Make sure you don't over tighten it or it might grind against the non-stick surface.
Just replaced my last stir crazy with this one........I had my other one for about 8 years.
It's typical to get no more than a tablespoon or less of unpopped kernels.
The popcorn turns out perfectly done, from the earliest to the last popped.
If you look at the photo, the disc on the top is a removable cover; under there is an indention with multiple holes.
You can take butter or margarine and spread it around when you set the machine up.
If I hand-wash it, it always feels a little greasy.
The bottom, heating part of the appliance is nonstick; you simply wipe it out with a soapy dishrag or paper towel.
Couldn't be easier.This appliance is light in weight and fits fine in one of my overhead cabinets.
Tried air poppers; blech, styrofoam pellets would taste about as good.
Microwave corn; too much salt and &quot;butter&quot; in the packets, plus they cost a lot.
Popping in a saucepan on the stove; horrible to clean afterwards and it burns.
Microwave poppers; don't get me started.THIS is the one.
And the  touch of oil used in the popping makes the popcorn taste wonderful.
We sometimes use olive oil for a special taste treat.
Anyway you pop it, this is a great device.
To use the bowl, pop the corn without the black lid on top.
When the popcorn is just done popping, wisk off the lid (and watch the last kernals that pop fly about) with a paper towel.
Quickly wipe the steam out of the bowl with the paper towel, put the bowl back over the popcorn, and flip.
These things last forever and truly make popcorn better than anything else I have tried.
I would eat it everyday if I could, and this is my favorite popcorn popper.
With fresh popcorn it will pop almost all of the kernels and, the plastic dome works great as a bowl.
My husband is a huge fan of this popper.
Thanks West Bend for many, many bowls of delicious popcorn.
It doesn't take much oil, and that helps us keep it a bit more healthy!.
Pops a large batch for when we have the grand kids over.
I like it lots better than the hot air poppers.
We already have a West Bend Popcorn Popper that has worked well for 3 years now.
Last week we transported the popper, popcorn and popcorn salt to our daughters house  to stay with our two young grand-daughters for an evening.
They loved the experience and were fascinated watching the corn "POP".
This Popper will be a Secret Santa gift for them along with their own labeled jar of Popcorn and special shaker of Popcorn Salt.
We can't wait for them to open their gift.[[ASIN:B00004RC6R West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper)).
But recently, my kids have decided that they really love popcorn.
You put your oil and popcorn kernels in the base, put the lid on top, and plug it in.
A little metal rod inside turns round slowly, evenly distributing the kernels and preventing any from sticking and burning.
First the bowl gets all steamy, then the kids start asking if it's ever going to pop, and within minutes, it's popping away.
When popping, it's at the top (where the black lid is).
Theoretically, you put your butter there while the popcorn is popping and it melts into the popcorn as you go.
And then flipping the bowl, even with the lid securely in place, we've never been able to use this reservoir without the butter dripping.
Still, it's easy enough to just melt our butter in the microwave or on the stovetop.
When popcorn is popped using coconut oil it taste just like the movie theater, I could not be happier.
The Stir Crazy does such an excellent job!  Air popped popcorn lacks &quot;soul&quot;.
This is the second one of these I have had.
I love popcorn and I bought this because of all the great reviews.
I tried going back to microwave popcorn for awhile, but it doesn't taste as good.
Making it stove-top still tastes great, but it's more work.
Overall, this is a great buy and would make a wonderful Christmas present for a family that doesn't have one.
This popcorn popper is, hands down, the best popper I've owned.
It's easy to use, easy to clean, takes no more than 5 minutes to pop a batch of popcorn,and the popcorn comes out tasting delicious.
What's also great is that it will automatically melt your butter and drip it over your popcorn as the kernels pop.
The popper's dome top doubles as a serving bowl.
My kids get an absolute kick out of watching the kernels pop.
If you're in the market for a popcorn popper, this is definitely the one to get.
you do not need to add anything....makes a complete bowl full - do not get the 6 oz.
The last time I owned a Stir Crazy was over ten years ago.
I got tired of all the Old Maids I was getting from micro wave popcorn.
So I came back to the Stir Crazy and I am glad I did.
I seldom if ever, see Old Maids anymore.
Just tried my new one and besides the cosmetic changes, lid and wand shape; it works just as great.
It did take maybe 1"-2" longer than my old one to pop.
I had no kernels though left in the popped corn.
The motor is sooo quite compared to my 20yo unit.The main problem is there were No Instructions included in the box.
Not a biggie for me since I already have my 20yo one sitting here (has a cracked bowl).
Just went to their website to make sure there were no major changes.
I bought this for a gift, but i liked it so much i kept it for myself.
Be sure to wash lid/bowl right away, or it's hard to keep clean.
This is a great popcorn popper for non-home use, but cleaning it is a bit of a pain.
The top/bowl can be washed in the dishwasher (without heat drying), but the bottom &quot;popper&quot; has to be carefully hand washed.
Everything still feels greasy even after multiple washings.
Another problem is typical of electronic equipment; the popper was recently brushed off the counter and broke.
The same has happened to the Whirly Pop and all it did was bend a little.
The Stir Crazy makes really good popcorn, but so does the Whirly Pop so I'll just stick with it.
We only use this popcorn popper when we have company over.
It was a gift as we usually just make it in the microwave in a brown paper bag.
It makes good popcorn, being able to use the lid as a bowl is nice and clean up is easy.
Haven't had any problems with it and we have had it a year or so, probably use it once a week.
More suited to a larger family I would think.
Since we have had good luck with it, I would recommend it.
This popcorn popper is perfect, especially if you have kids, entertain kids or just like to watch the science unfold.
We use one half the oil called for in the manual and it still makes excellent popcorn.
When it stops popping I quickly slap the plastic lid on and turn the entire popper upside down and then unplug the cord.
Even moving quickly the oil will be smoking before I can unplug it.
It was a gift for my daughter, and she LOVES it.
I ate some of the popcorn, and I love it, too.
:-) I did lots of research before choosing this West Bend popper for her, but it paid off.
The kids had a great time with this popcorn maker.
However, since it was well-loved it only lasted a few years before breaking.
Even the dog gets a kick out of it!Be sure to follow the suggestion to put very, very small pats of butter on top.
Larger pats will not melt in time.We have drawers in our kitchen for our lower cabinets.
I simply place the popcorn bowl under the heating unit and it fits with room to spare.
They eventually either quit heating or quit stirring,but that's at least after 2 to 3 years of use.
Make really good popcorn and the top is the serving dish.
I like this popper, easy to use easy to clean, nice crisp popcorn.
tried using the opening in top but makes popcorn a little tougher..I really do like the crisp corn without the butter.
Bought this popper to replace one just like it that we've used for years.
Part of the older one's rim broke off so thought we'd get another.
The old one still works fine, but we have a spare and cannot say how great this product is.
Try using olive oil instead of the Orville Reddenbacker (sp) product and the popcorn is even better.
This popper makes great popcorn with most all of the kernels popping.
It is easier to melt butter in the microwave and pour it over the finished popcorn.
The lid washes nicely in the top rack of the dishwasher (water temp 150 with no drying heater).
The popper itself is a bit awkward to clean.
It would be nice of the popper bottom would lift off the heating element for easier washing.
We use gourmet type corn and it pops up large and fluffy.
We use this popcorn maker several times a month.
I forgot how tasty freshly popped corn can be.
It is much tastier than microwave popcorn.Cleaning the popcorn maker is a little bit tedious since it cannot be submerged in water.
I use a sudsy wet paper towel to clean it.
Have used this for popcorn and for roasting coffee beans.
It's great for the latter because of the continuous stirring.
This popcorn maker was exactly what I was looking for! It pops corn quickly and is extremely easy to use.
I guess the biggest drawback for me is that the instructions recommend hand washing the bowl and the other parts inside.
I would really love to put it in the dishwasher, but don't want to ruin it so I've been hand washing it every time.
Other than that, I use organic coconut oil just because it's supposed to be better for you than other oils.
I use the same recommended quantities and it never burns or sticks.
Love this popcorn maker and have been using it probably ever other day or so for 3 months now.
Still works great and the nonstick surface isn't scratched as other reviews have stated.
Not sure if they've updated their materials or something, but I haven't had any issues! (yet)Hope this helps! Enjoy!.
I am a popcorn lover, from a family of popcorn lovers, and trust me this is the One to buy.
It is close to the fluffiness of an air pop, but has a little bit of the crunchiness of a stove-top model.
I debated over getting this for a while, but once I did the only regret I had was not getting it sooner!.
I read all the reviews for the other poppers, as well as the deluxe Stir Crazy and decided to stick with the basic model.
I have used it several times now, using one tablespoon of coconut oil to pop the corn and Bob's Red Mill white popcorn.
It does a fantastic job, leaves no unpopped kernels and my family couldn't be happier.
We make popcorn nearly every night, a minimum of 150 days a year.
This popper does an adequate job without burning the kernels.
Once the towel is dry that means the moisture is absorbed, and you keep it in the fridge so it doesn't dry out or mold.
I find it difficult to get all of the kernels to pop.
The quality of the popcorn is quite good.
If I keep the popper going longer than the directions indicate, most of the kernels will pop without burning the popcorn.
I got this because I missed having fresh popcorn from my days of employment in a movie theater.
If you don't want to shell out the hundreds needed to get the big popcorn cart with the stainless popper, then this is great.
Just add your oil and popcorn and plug it in.
Cleanup can be cumbersome, but the popcorn always tastes great.
Decided we would pop our own, the amount we wanted and season to our liking, but we no longer had a popper.
After searching the web we decided on this one.
Very pleased with our decision and would reccommend to anyone.
Bar didn't drag, it does take a little longer than an air popper.
This is a little bigger than you may expect.
Greasy bottom and greasy top and an arm to get gunk and oil out of is a pain.
This is the second one I've owned after a former roommate sent the old one flying across the kitchen.
The older one used more metal parts and had what I personally believe to be a better build quality.
With that said, I have had no problems with the newer one.
I've been using it for several years now and the wife and I love popcorn.
Therefore, it gets heavy regular use and has stood up to that use surprisingly well.
We have used this popper quite a bit and just love it.
We make carmel corn for the holidays as gifts and this was just perfect.
I've had one of these for over 4 years.
I've used it fairly heavily and it still works.
The bowl is cracked, but that doesn't really affect anything, other than that it's in great shape.
This thing is amazing at popping with close to 100% efficiency - that is there are very few unpopped kernels if you do it right.
Sometimes I use a bit of cooking oil, a dash of salt, and 2 tablespoons of water.
Other times I'll use more oil and some sugar.
Other times I'll use coconut oil and a bit of olive oil.
It's great being able to throw just about anything in this popper and have the mess all be self contained in a serving bowl.
When mine finally kicks the bucket I'll almost certainly get a new one.
This works great! Add oil, popcorn, plug it in, and in about a minute you have popcorn! It is easy to clean, but not immersible.
This popper pops every last kernel of corn and burns none.
I love it and it produces the best popcorn I have ever had.
Would have given a 5 star rating but this one does not turn quite as well as others I have had in the past.
Had an air popper and popcorn was everywhere.
Love this one...it even has its own bowl, so you don't have to search for one!.
easy to use, makes great popcorn, and I love the fack that you just turn it upside down and it's in it's own bowl.
This is a fun and a bit of a nostalgic gift I received from a friend of mine for Christmas last year.
Popcorn is my favorite snack and I've always cooked my own.
Microwave popcorn tastes too greasy and has a funny chemical taste and smell.
Plus you never get enough from a microwave bag.About a year ago we upgraded our kitchen to a smooth cook top and restaurant grade cookware.
I can't cook popcorn with quality equipment like we now have.
It's quick and easy to make, tastes great and easy to clean up afterward.
It pops all the kernels to the last pop.
I wish they figured how some great dishwasher safe design to make it easier to clean.
But for now, I use it once a week for a healthy snack.
The rotating arms stir the kernels as they heat.
You can also use less oil than a non-stirring popper would allow.
This is not the popcorn popper Alton Brown recommends on his episode of Good Eats about popcorn.
I usually agree with his recommendations, but not this time.
We have been using this for years to make our popcorn.
I've interrupted stuffing my mouth w hot popcorn to tell anyone looking for a popcorn machine, look  no further.
My wife and I rent movies, which is not a family activity without popcorn with budder.
For such a modest price, we are happy with the performance of this device.
There are more options than just butter, but we don't.
Unfortunately, through no fault of West Bend, I had to replace the popper.
However, the metal base is not as sturdy as the base on the original (older) popper.
When you clean the inside of the popper you can tell West Bend has used a cheaper metal material than on older models.
I'd pay more to have the stronger bottom (the area where you spread the kernels).
Overall, I am happy with the popper since I am stir crazy for popcorn!.
I already owned a popper like this one but it didn't last as long as I had hoped for.
I tried a different kind but it wan't as easy to use & clean as this one.
The popcorn tastes great, the clean up is quick  & maybe I'll be lucky, and it will last!.
My husband's quit working and he loves popcorn in the evening.....now we can both watch movies and enjoy hot popcorn.
My grandfather used to have a popcorn maker like this one.
After he moved it was lost or sold sometime.This one works like a charm.
My father loves that popcorn tastes better and can be healthier.
I've always seen him butter the stuff though.
They're just used to circulate the popcorn as it pops.
Do not put the entire thing in the dishwasher.
I handwashed the lid and bowl so I've no idea how it handles a dishwasher.
I did not purchase this on Amazon, but bought it directly from Target, this is an excellent popper.
Very few unpopped kernels using nothing other Kroger brand popping corn.
I am sure a gourmet brand would be even better.
If you love popcorn, this is the popper to buy.
Stirring rod works great, easy clean-up, simple directions.
This popper just could not be any easier.
Plug it in, pour in the oil and popcorn and then sit back and watch!  My kids love to watch it pop.
It can make a small amount for a snack or a huge bowlful for the whole family on movie night.
There is hardly an unpopped kernel left after it has finished popping.
The popcorn is fluffy and can be evenly coated with butter if you use the simple butter dispenser on top.
I highly recommend this popcorn popper and it's a great price.
If you want popcorn like in the movies at home this is the way to go.
Best poper I have found on the market that will make it, season plus butter your popcorn all be its self.
I received my popper and made popcorn right away.
It works great and I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money for a big expensive popper.
I used gourmet popcorn and I used olive oil.
I inverted the lid and put real unsalted butter on it after popping was done.
Yes, I'm bad! Easy clean up and no problems.
I like the fact that you can add all your ingredients,flavoring s,etc., at one time and let the machine mix it up.
It would be a toss up to decide between the two which is better.
Microwave in the bag is fluffier and more convenient.
This is cheaper to use in the long tun.
Won't know about durability for a year or so! Not a bad choice!12/05/2012After further use I'd give it a 4star rating at least.
Sometimes trial and error is where you learn.
I figured out that the product itself was functioning fine and that I was in error.
After correcting my inequities the crazy popper works great!  Oh, don't put butter and your other ingredients in the bottom with the oil and popcorn.
The butter and ingredients will leave a black burnt film on your popcorn and crazy popper.
And THAT makes clean up difficult!! Add that later as recommended! It really does pop like crazy.
This little popper has probably saved me hundreds of dollars over purchasing microwave popcorn without all the preservatives and whatever else is in there.
It's reasonably priced and works well, had it for almost two years or so.
We use a little bit of canola oil to pop the popcorn, and then add some popcorn seasoning.
however it does not have an on/off switch.
I give it a four because I think the manf should put an on//off switch on it.
I had an old faithful popcorn popper and could not find one to reorder.
I researched on Amazon, and this one seemed to fit the need.
I only use Orville popcorn, and it popped beautifully.
I do not use the butter melter on the top of the bowl.
Once popcorn stops popping, flip over and remove the base.
For years we had a stovetop popcorn popper that had a handle to turn which stirred the kernels.
It made great popcorn but it finally fell apart.
I bought this to replace it.It's been a huge hit in our house.
Not only does it make great popcorn but it's great fun to watch it work.
It's so much fun that the movie doesn't start in our house until the popcorn is made.
(My oldest son always says he gets it right...amazing!)The popcorn comes out tasting great - no complaints there.
It's fast too, faster than doing it on the stove.
First, as soon as the popcorn is done popping flip it over and remove the base.
Even if you unplug it the base remains quite hot and the popcorn will quickly burn unless you do this.
Second, don't bother melting butter in the top compartment.
It doesn't all melt and it just makes the lid/bowl that much harder to clean.
I used my popper and it worked very well.
The instructions  called for 1 cup of popcorn unless useing gormet popcorn, then use 3/4 cup.
I used 3/4 cup of gormet popping corn, which was still a bit much as every kernel popped.
The butter holder located on top works pretty good, just make sure you use soft butter, and thin pats.
The popcorn tastes very good, and comes out dry and crunchy.
If you are looking for a popper I think this is a good one.
We use coconut oil and not popping oil.
Tastes great and the oil is pure and tastes great.
I like it!!! easy making, Big enough  for 3-4 people,  It can use butter directly.It's much better than other brand machine.
A family friend has a Stir-Crazy and after scoffing at it, tried it & loved it.
Avoided making popcorn in the past because of the clean-up hassles, but this is a breeze.
So quick & tastes just like stove-top popcorn.
This is my third and fourth popcorn popper.
I have had at least one and right now two for years because I love the way this popper makes popcorn.
I can limit the oil and don't need butter and it still has that bit of buttery taste.
It is the best!  Sadly, they do die and hopefully, will still be there when these next two bite the dust.
They have averaged about five years of daily popping.
This is a great popcorn maker and does its job perfectly.
As other reviewers have written you will need to make minor adjustments to the arm that spins around.
I use Bobs Red Mill White Popcorn and it turns out perfectly every time.
It is a bit of a chore to clean, but not all that big a problem.
I don't care for the butter infuser on top.
Still, if you like to pop corn and not use the microwave, this is a good option.
If you like real movie theater taste forget the microwave and buy this,with the right oil and popcorn you can not beat the taste.
Looking for a popcorn popper? Get it, you'll love it!.
Does what it says and it does it good,  Would tell anyone to buy this popper and yes, all the corn pops.
We gave everyone we know one of these poppers for Xmas this year -- with resounding success.
And since they live in other states, we got free shipping through Amazon, too.
We recommend that you measure the oil and seeds according to the user manual for best results.
I have this West Bend corn popper for years.
This will help to keep the kernels with the proper amount of moisture and I guarantee all the kernels will pop.
THIS WEST BEND STIR KRAZY IS ONE OF THE BEST CORN POPPERS IN THE MARKET.
It is great that Amazon carries it at such good price.
I got this product after having homemade popcorn with the Sir Crazy at a friend's house.
It is SO easy to use and makes delicious, light-tasting popcorn.
I just use a little olive oil and kernels.
Doesn't even need salt or butter in my opinion!.
Edit added 3/7/13: I still have this popcorn popper, it's still amazing, and the non-stick is still intact.
LOL, so last night I picked one up.
The kids and I tested it out tonight and we are more than pleased.
I'm sorry, but what do you expect of non-stick coating? Its not indestructable.
Just make sure the rods arent scraping and it should last a long time.
My grandfather has been using his stir-crazy popper for over 20 years now and its just fine.
My unit seems to have the rod reverse direction rather than scrape the bottom if it gets hung up, great feature.
I have also noticed a few people gave poor reviews because the automatic shut-off doesnt work.
the instructions clearly state that there is no automatic shutoff.
Honestly, you can't manufacter thousands of units a day (of ANY product) and expect that every single one will be perfect, thats just life.
There are plenty of things in everyday life that have defects, car parts for example.
Its the nature of mass manufacturing and really can't be avoided.Overall this is a wonderful product, and I am so glad I bought it.
One suggestion to the manufacturer is to make a small 2qt popper for personal use.
I received this popper as a birthday gift several years ago from a brother.
This guy is a great gift giver!!It has been my faithful and trusty sidekick for nearly 5 years.
I use it weekly on average, but sometimes as frequently as several days in a row when I'm on a binge.
I received one of these 30 yrs ago for a wedding present and loved it.
Must have gotten lost in a divorce, move, etc but was so excited when I saw this at Target a few weeks ago.
Purchased thru Amazon (cheaper and free shipping) and only noticable difference is that the rod seems a little flimsier than the original.
I was considering purchasing a commercial popper but not now - this works great at a fraction of the price!.
I love homemade popcorn and this works fine to accomplish this goal.
And yes, I do hand feed the popcorn to my dogs.
But th en again I toss it to them.
Now I don't have a lot of unpopped kernals left.
Plus I can make my popcorn anyway I want.
My first popcorn popper survived over ten years of twice-a-week popping until my 10-yr-old dropped the lid and broke it.
When I first read about the Stir Crazy, I thought it was a gimmick.
One more thing to break - but I ordered one anyway because there wasn't much selection.
What a great move!  Microwave popcorn is convenient, but it has a tendency to burn if you don't watch it.
Dribble some oil in, add my favorite &quot;premium&quot; popcorn, plug it in, and pretty much every kernel pops every time.
Use that idle microwave to melt the butter.
A quick swirl with the OXO Nylon Palm Soap Brush, and the parts are clean.
I actually bought this to roast coffee in but the popcorn came in first so I gave it 'a whirl'.
I love it! It couldn't be easier and the several batches of popcorn I've made came out perfect.
So, I roast the coffee in a pan on the stove with success and this machine is dedicated to making popcorn only.
I bought this for my wife for Christmas and surprised she hasn't worn it out yet.
Have had this popper for over 6 months  and it works as good as the Joe Namath one I had for over 20 years.
3 minutes and a full bowl of popcorn is yours!.
I have one of those big red fancy popcorn machines on a cart and I love it.
I wanted a stir crazy for those times when I just want a small amount and don't want to clean my big machine.
and the feature that allows the butter to melt into the popcorn while popping makes the popcorn very yummy ;0).
Only one note of advice: follow the instructions as far as the proper amount of oil and popcorn that is listed in the manual.
if you don't do that and you don't like the results, it will be your fault, not the machine.
We had a similar but the bowl cracked after about 1 1/2 years.
Its impossible to find a replacement so this was a good deal.
Pops great and doesn't seem to get as messy from the oil as the previous one.
I bought this popper about 3 weeks ago.
I must admit that this popper works great.
Since you only use a small amount of oil, it is not oily at all.
Also, it's not as dry as those air poppers.
But if you want tons of butter on your popcorn, this machine is not set up to do this.
However, if you want a slight buttery taste, with great tasting popcorn, then this is the popper for you.
I've read reviews where they say that the non-stick surface breaks apart.
if no update, then it still works fine).
Only downside is the base is not able to be put in water so clean up is a bit of a chore.
Get your taste buds set for an explosion of popcorn the way it should be made.
Gather a few family members or friends and make this an event; or, snuggle up by yourself with a favorite show.
Personally, I like to pop the seeds in garlic oil, sprinkle with melted butter and garlic.
Positively, sensational.The West Bend has a nice clear dome to watch the excitement going on inside.
The swing arm makes certain that all your seeds pop.
I've had a steady lineage of Stir Crazy poppers.
When one wears out or breaks, I buy another.
The only real problem with them is the useless butter chamber and lid on the top.
It's completely worthless and just makes the bowl harder to clean.
Hey West Bend, save us all some time and money -- redesign the bowl without that top chamber.
Also, I had to laugh at the reviews that complained about the stirring wire rubbing against the non-stick surface.
As another reviewer pointed out, it's a metal wire.
Bend it to where you want it!  Someone else complained that oil gets inside the mechanism.
Maybe it does, but I get at least a year out each Stir Crazy, and I use them a lot.
They're easy to clean and easy to use.
I've tried others including the microwave bowls with the gimmicky "powercups", but Stir Crazy is still the best.
As far as poppers go, this one is great.
It's easy to clean and no old maids.
I don't care for the plastic bowl, but we use a different bowl for eating, anyway.
The bowl doesn't look great after cleaning, but maybe I'll try it in the dishwasher and see if it looks better.
finally, a [popcorn popper that doesn't break on the first use out of the box-goodbye Cuisinart.
The popcorn was really good and no parts fell off the popper for the first time in a long time.
My kids love to watch the popcorn make!! The taste is also a lot better than microwave popcorn.
This thing is lots of fun, the kids like to watch the popcorn go pop-pop-pop.
It's just a cheap black plastic lid and I'm sure I threw it in the trash thinking it was from a coffee can or something.
And it's an odd size so none of the (many, many) other plastic lids we have lying around will fit.
So now we have to put the bowl on a plate or something to keep the salt and butter from leaking out.
I have been on the hunt on how to make theater popcorn for a year now.
Or, I don't even use them because they are ridiculously expensive.
With good popcorn, no un-popped kernels to deal with either.
I got this popcorn popper machine for a work team event.
Everyone just Loved it! i used to think microwave popcorn is great, the real popcorn is much better.
and it is so much fun watchin the corns pop in front of you! also it's pretty each to clean.
i think this product is great and i would recommend it.
We have had numerous of these over the years.
Typically the plastic top goes before anything else.
Always does a good job of popping corn.
I am blown away at the level of service that I was provided from WestBend.
I ordered this pot (which is very attractive and well built) and sadly it arrived damaged on a Friday.
I think its great that companies like this still exist.
The pot brews 100 cups in about 70-75 minutes and its HOT!~.
I bought this because my old West Bend 55 cup coffee urn gave me over 25 years of service before biting the dust.
That is a LONG time! So of course my replacement was going to be a West Bend.
I decided to go bigger and got this 100 cup.
The price was great and I already used it for an event.
The coffee came out perfect! I highly recommend West Bend brand.
Bought this 100 cup commercial urn for my synagogue.
It is used about twice a week and makes a good cup of coffee.
I purchased two of these a year ago to use in a ministry that serves people who are homeless.
I've had no trouble with leakage at spout or lid.Bonus points for getting them for $89 each on a gold box deal.
Good fit for what we are using it for.
We serve about 75-100 people coffee daily at my work and it is working great.
After reading some reviews we settled on a couple of these.
They brew coffee much faster than the old ones, and make a better tasting cup-of-joe to boot.
They're also very easy to break down and clean.
If you need a whole lot of coffee in a hurry, you could do much worse than a West Bend 33600.
This is such an exemplary teapot that I've tried and stored away several others during the years I've owned this one.
It's basically indestructible (try to dent it -- just try...), the flat bottom heats quite quickly (esp.
on gas ranges), the whistle is extremely solid and probably unbreakable, and the whistle is *loud*.
This is a beautiful kettle, well made, and has a lovely two-tone whistle.
I drink tea on a daily basis and after 3 years of use it looks good as new.
The only design issue I have is that it's annoying to locate and put on the padded handle so I don't get burnt.
To manage, I just use our regular oven mitts.
But, if you're a coffee drinker using a french press, you use this thing daily.
I dropped my previous kettle which bent the spout.
Otherwise, I'd be smooth sailing with that one.
They mention that this is &#34;Onyx&#34;, not black.
This is precisely true!  It looks gorgeous!There are certain things, in my humble opinion, that you up the spending on.
Loved the first Chantel teakettle we purchased some years ago for our home, and the second kettle we got for our camper.
Incidentally, we filter our water with a Brita system, which may help prevent mineral buildup in the whistle.
We've never had a problem with the whistles.
This is my second one of these teapots.
The first one sprung a leak after many years of faithful service.
It is gorgeous to look at and very functional.
I love the quilted mitt that comes with the kettle.
You definitely need it since the handle does get hot.
This kettle has been doing its job in my kitchen for 12 years of almost daily use.
All previous kettles I've had broke or corroded after less than a year.
The construction is solid, the whistle loud and the heat conduction excellent.
I've had no problems with rust or corrosion but I do not keep it full and closed when not in use.
The handle conducts heat so a pot holder is required.
I believe Chantal now includes an insulated  handle cover with this product which would solve that problem.
I have owned 2 of these, both the stainless finish.
The first one I bought in '99, and used it on an electric range.
I used abrasive metal scrubbers on the stainless steel, and though minute scratches were visible, it was returned to a bright shiny finish each time.
One day ~2007, I left the whistle top open and burned my kettle up; the plastic parts in the whistle melted beyond repair.
Now, on the new gas range, the handle is definitely too hot to touch when the water boils.
I think I'll look into getting a silicone sleeve that I can leave on it.
I have a water cooler that has hot water, so bought it for looks.
It looks great on my stove top with my other stainless steel items.
The only downside is that it was too expensive.
I was searching for a more retro style tea kettle but I didn't trust buying an old used one.
I decided on this kettle because I like the design.
I was specifically looking for a kettle that had no plastic...which I think makes anything look cheap and ugly.
Have had this teakettle for over five years with perfect service.
Earlier, I had a blue enamel Chantal from Williams-Sonoma, and the interior enamel began flaking off.
Seems like an after-thought workaround.Earlier this year, I saw the same kettle at the home of a relative.
She had a silicone handle on her kettle handle that apparently is safe for use when heating.
It's a shame Chantal does not provide a silicone holder instead of the less than ideal holder supplied with the kettle.
One star deduction for the pot holder issue, otherwise a great product.
As an avid tea drinker I have to say that this is the best tea kettle I ever had.
Heats up quickly and the handle is OK without pot holder.
On the expensive side but well worth it.
I would buy another Chantal over any other kettle out there.
Mild patina, but still shiny.no issues, no problem, used on smooth top stove.
I've had mine for 3 years now and it works perfectly every time.
I'm buying one for my elderly mother because of its safety and reliablility.
I have this can opener for several years now and I love it.
The smooth edge cut is a huge improvement over the conventional style.
Also, tops can fit back on the can since they a edge cut and there are no sharp edges.
This is definitely a good value for the money!Update: Mine died at the end of 2005.
I think that it was the result of a dull blade.
The only readon I didn't give it 5 is because it doesn't have a hands free mode.
With 2 little ones at my ankles, i am partial to anything that doesn't require constant attention.
So far it is really nice quality can opener.
I really like it's height for those taller cans.
If you're looking for a bread box for store-bought bread, you won't like this.
This bread keeper is sized to fit a bread machine-sized loaf.
This is a really good way to keep home made bread.
The slicer wore out quickly from the sharp slicing knife.
This is the second of this item I have purchased.
The first, which I paid quite a bit more for several years ago, is still in use and fine.
However, I often have two types of bread available at the same time.
This cleverly designed keeper and slicing guide do the job for me perfectly.
Yes, it is a little messy when you open it.
On the other hand, the 2 pound loaves from my Zojirushi horizontal bread maker fit perfectly, and with room to spare.
It also looks great on the counter, and is crystal clear to help highlight what is inside.
The slicing guide (which is shown sideways in the Amazon.com photo), is the perfect companion to a sharp, serrated bread knife.
It is by no means flimsy, and simply looks and works very well.
I bought this item becuase we only eat home made bread.
This really does keep our bread fresh~! It also has kept us from wasting a lot of bread.
We (house of 3) were going through almost 3 loaves a week just for toast, sandwiches and french toast.
But now that we can slice them evenly we go through 1 and a half loaves.I only gave it 4 stars because 1.
The blades get caught due to them being too short.
3.There are deep knife markings on the bottom already.
I try not to think that we may have eaten some plastic.
It has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it.
It cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized Loaves.
Glad we purchased it; great friend to our bread machine.
I'm terrible at slicing bread straight so it is a lifesaver with the insert.
Just make sure you use a sharp serrated bread knife when slicing home made  bread.
I have learned the hard way that home made bread tends to crumble, deflate and make a mess easily if your knife is dull.
With the cutting guide inside the keeper, it will help to avoid that.
Great item and I would recommend it to anyone who makes home made bread.
The product works just like it supposed to.
It is clear, compact and easy to use and clean.
Outside of a great way of storing homemade bread, I love the included slice guide.
Although I could always go out and buy a slicing guide, I liked the combination of slice guide and storage container.
It's so lovely to have you demand reviews for items I never bought.....and I'm only giving this so you'll stop sending me emails.
This is actually my second purchase of this product.
The problem with the "slicer" itself, the white portion of the item, is that it will eventually break down after continuous use.
After losing two of the "teeth", it became more difficult for me to get the size of slice i liked.
So i went ahead and about another one.
the cost is cheap, so I felt it was worth it.
And now i have two plastic containers, and can be handy in the event i bake two loaves in one day.
The bread slicer guide makes nice and accurate slices of bread compared to just using a knife with no guide.
I wasn't sure I was going to like this bread keeper.
I love how easy it is to manage.
Also I was trying to use my serrated knife and sometimes it would cut the slicer and didn't cut the bread good.
bread knife and now it slices good through the teeth of the slicer.
NOt only can I slice my bread perfectly for sandwiches, but I have a pretty, clear container to hold the bread.
I used to have an "Emily's" bread box - similar design but square.
I liked that better because with the curve this has on one side has to be aligned to close.
This is a very nice set of mini ladles.
This is my second purchase of these ladles.
I use the larger one to skim the cream off the not-so-large top of my gallon jug of farm milk.
I must've thrown away the previous ladle by mistake.
These "Little Ladles" are very handy and look good enough for either kitchen or table use.
I got thease for my mom so she's not stuck useing the big one all the time.
They work alot better for herand are easier to clean also.
The largest one probably isn't more than 3 tablespoonfuls, and the sizes graduate down from there.
But they're perfect for certain kitchen tasks that the bigger ladles aren't right for.
For one thing, they're small, obviously, and most ladles are big, for dipping soups, etc.
Shopped forever to replace my small plastic lades.
Love them to spoon sauces, fat, cheeses, gravy.
Happy that  the stainless will now last and they are dishwasher safe.
I rate these 4 Stars only because they aren't as sturdy as I would prefer, but for the price they are a real value.
I bought them to use when filling my small canning jars for the gourmet batches of fruity things I'm canning.
They are lightweight, and I like the roundness of their bowls.
The handles have a handy loop to the ends so they can hang on hooks.
just the sizes i was looking for ..replacing small plastic type ladlesgood value for the money ...might come back for more  :-).
They have many uses for all the sizes.
Works very well, stable and easy to hold especially if you have any type of grip problem with your hand.
Well worth the price and the protective legs and the triangular design make it easy to use when grating into a bowl.
It's very tall for a grater, and the knob on the top fits right into you palm, and it makes grating very easy.
I've had this for over a year now.., no sign of rust or aging.
The way it's in a pyramid shape.., I haven't shredded a knuckle yet.
I like the sizes of the holes.., I shred a lot of ginger and it works really well for that.
Also no sharp edges on the inside and easy to clean.
I'm learning to cook-and part of learning is not knowing everything you need to have a kitchen with all the right utensils.
I like the look and feel of this grater.
It looks nice displayed on the kitchen counter.
The only drawback I have is that the standard size shredding side is not very sharp.
Usually, I prefer a shredder that is not really sharp.
We have discovered that we prefer using the side that produces slightly thicker shreds of cheese.
Sometimes, cheese does get stuck up inside, but we just use a kitchen brush to solve that problem.
Overall, it's a good product, but if you like a really sharp shredder, you probably would not be happy with this one.
I looked into a number of box and in this case tower graters before deciding on this one.
That makes it taller than the 1/2 gallon carton of Minute Maid OJ I have in my fridge, and with a larger footprint.
Each of the grater's 3 sides measures a tad under 5 1/2" at the base.
It is super steady because of the rubber footies.
The rubber covered handle is easy to hold.
It has a nice assortment of grating sizes and the blades seem sharp enough to do a good job.
It is also heavy enough to feel like it is good quality and will last.
I had an old one that had container attached to bottom, didn't work well.
This has rubber rounded top, rubber feet to keep from slipping and 3 grating sides that fill all my needs.
The design of this grater makes it very stable and handy.
I grate everything from cheese to carrots to nutmeg with it.
It's so sturdy I never have to worry that it will slip or buckle when I use elbow grease.
The ball handle makes for a very comfortable, solid grip.
This item is definitely dishwasher safe, but it's also easy to hand wash if you're using it several times in a row.
I've had mine for years, and one of the feet finally came off so I'm replacing it.
That's the one change I'd make to this item: attach the feet better.
It's a little awkward to store because of it's size, but well worth finding a spot for.
It is very easy to use and very easy on the "fingers" in the process of grating.
You can grate a large block of cheese easily in less than two minutes.
The grated cheese will stay inside the grater until you are finished.
It gives you the diffent choices of how fine you want your cheese grated.
It is sturdy and easy to control when you're grating.
The only thing I am wary of is cheese getting stuck on the inside at the 'feet' of the grater.
But, I just have to make sure to check and wash it out.
I have had lots of graters over the years but this one is the best and also less expensive than any of the others.
I especially like the knob to hold on to.
I've used it about 15 times.Sara in NC.
You won't skin your knuckles with this this tapered, sturdy grater.No stains or rust after 1.5 years of use.Highly recommended.
I am a 62 year old bachelor and I've been cooking all my life back to the days when I helped my mother.
She used a paring knife, but I never got the hang of that.
When I moved out here to Utah my Sons girlfriend threw away the old slicer that I had.
I ordered this one when she moved out and I took over the cooking.
This is one of the most versatile and useful slicers I have ever had.
The only drawback I can find is that there aren't quite enough inserts to do what it would be otherwise capable of doing.
I gave it four stars because of the insert problem I mentioned earlier.
But as far as slicing and dicing you can do it as fast as you can push a vegetable back and forth.
As a longtime cook I highly recommend this product for fast slicing and keeping your fingers out-of-the-way.
I bought this mandoline on the recommendation of Cooks' Illustrated magazine, who said it's just not worth spending the money for an expensive one.
My husband is obsessed with this little gadget.
He says it really makes cooking fun! Works well with potatoes.
Slicing is difficult when what you are slicing becomes small (watch your fingers), but it is still very useful.
But works great on potatoes carrots cucumbers and the such.
Yes the product has a sharp blade and could be considered dangerous but so do scissors, knives and razors.
It is exactly what is described and works very well.
Very easy to use and easy to clean.
very easy to use and clean, truly multipurpose, easy to change guides, nice heavy material, very good price.
Mainly use to prep stuff for the dehydrator but occasionally use it to julienne veggies or slice potatoes to roast.
Little advice: Buy cut proof gloves because you can lose the tip of your finger (nail and all) without even realizing it.
Have used my mandoline for mainly hard vegetables and works well so far.
Use my magic bullet for grating hard cheese.
In the future, I won't ever be in such a great hurry that I  forget use the safety grip.
Yeah buddy,  I sure learned my lesson on using kitchen tools properly.
It's important to remember that it's almost impossible to sharpen theblade on any mandoline.
The blade is dull after a lot of hard use and there'sno hope for re-sharpening.
It cost about $150.I use my plastic Progressive all the time.It's four years old and when it finallydulls out, I'll throw it away.
Economical and disposeable and highly recommended.Lynn Hoffman--Author of The New Short Course in Wine and the eternally sharpnovel bang BANG.
i needed it to make slices of potato, cucumber, and onion etc.
i don't know how long it will last yet.
the price was great so it's no big deal to me.
it seems to be safe to use as long as you put that top cap piece onto the vegetable item to hold it securely.
right now i am very happy with this purchase and item.
i will update if anything happens.update: it works great!update: march 01 2012: it is still working great.
i use it several times a week and i am so happy i bought it.
it slices onions up into delicious thing round circles.update: july 11 2013 i use it all the time.
i always rinse it off after each use.
always hold onto the top cap that holds the vegetable into place and never let go until you have completed the slicing.
it works great and i am still very happy with this purchase.
I bought this mandoline in particular, because I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something I wasn't sure I would use.
If the mandoline blades weren't sharp, it wouldn't work and consumers would be dissatisfied with the product.
It is our responsibility to be careful and take the precautions necessary to make sure we don't get cut.
MY fault completely!I'm very satisfied with this mandoline.
I may upgrade in the future now that I know I will use it and enjoy it, but this is a great starter!.
I recommend it to my friends as a handy, simple to operate, easy to clean kitchen gadget, great for the price.
We have owned one of these for a few years.
LOVE it! Just put the cloves in, and roll it briskly - presto! - peeled garlic.
This maybe quite gimicky like another reviewer said, but some gimmicks are quite useful.
Mybe if you do not use much garlic then you will only be buying 'another tool' for the drawer.
But if like me you use alot of garlic, then this will be of great benefit.
But for now it is on my wishlist.
You will never have to peel a dam piece of garlic again.
just put a few pieces in and roll on the counter then boom a perfect piece of clean garlic.
Then use the Josephs Garlic Rocker to cut them up.
I've lived without one of these for a very long time.
Whacking a knife blade over a clove is fine for one or two at a time.
Wish I'd realized that sooner, and just bought it from Amazon.
This works well and I was so pleased that I bought two for friends as gifts.
It's good quality and after hundreds of uses it looks brand new.
I saw this being used by a local cooking instructor in a cookware store.
Wish I had discovered this 20 years ago, as I use a ton of garlic.
I'm now telling all my friends and relatives about it.
You can't go wrong for this price either.
You have to try it to believe it.
Just a few rolls and the garlic clove is peeled!! Never again will I peel by hand!.
I tried this and it works great!  At first I thought what the heck.
But soon I realized that it is really cool and fast to use.
I love garlic but hate to peel it!.
Works like a charm! This takes a painfully boring task and turns it into nothing at all.
Every garlic-loving cook should have one in his/her kitchen.
Since I'm too lazy to go out and find tubing and cut it with pinking shears, I guess I'll have to keep buying them.
(You can shake it out and keep going.)- Not as sexy as slapping a big chef's knife- Single-purpose gadget.
As other reviewers have noted, it works well but does get gummed-up and needs rinsing after awhile.
The thing takes a little getting used to, but it will do the job.
I can't believe that a little rubbery tube is so useful.
I chop garlic all the time and I'm so glad my hands don't stink anymore from all that peeling, and it's so much quicker!.
If you cook with garlic (if you don't, please don't invite me for dinner) you should get one of these things.
I've always find peeling garlic a tedious, somewhat difficult and messy task.
It's good, not magic - sometimes the skin will stick and break and you'll still have to do a bit of picking with your fingers.
On the whole, though, it's a terrific and very useful product.Plus, you can just toss it in the dishwasher when you're done.
In the meantime, it does its job well.
Super simple; works perfect, should last several lifetimes.
I watched a video on youtube, could not believe how easy it is to peel garlic w/o crushing it.
Wow, for canners or folks that like to use lots of fresh garlic, this might be the best invention of the 21st century so far.
The price seems a bit high as it is just a piece of silicon tubing, but it really works well for peeling garlic cloves.
But I also love the very E-Z-Rol Garlic peeler for a couple of reasons:1.
I hate to spend extra time on any unnecessary extra steps when cooking.
If I am making multiple batches of garlic laden meals to freeze ahead of time, the garlic peeler definitely saves time.
Children love to use this and it is certainly safer than a knife for young ones.
This is the neatest, easiest cooking tool I have ever used.
You put the clove of garlic into the E-Z Roll and roll 2 or 3 times on a surface.
Your garlic is ready to be cut, diced, shredded.
You just rinse it under some hot water and dry it off and back in the utensil drawer it goes.
Quickly loosens the "skin" off garlic cloves making it a breeze to remove.
I don't know how I lived without this!.
I like mine so much, I brought ones for my mom, sis, and daughter-in-law.
I have always smashed cloves of garlic with the flat blade of my chef's knife against a cutting board, then peeled them.
I love the smell of fresh garlic, but there are times when I don't want my hands to retain this aroma.
However, if I am chopping, mincing, slicing, or slivering garlic with a knife, then I still get some garlic smell on my hands.
The Cuisinart Mini-Prep Food Processor is great for chopping, mincing, and pureeing garlic, but it won't slice or sliver it.
(Also, I keep jars of both roasted and regular garlic, minced and chopped, in my refrigerator.).
This roller makes peeling garlic SOOO easy! Worth the money and is a great gift.
Holds up well but I always hand wash mine.
Simple, easy, Works great, particularly with crunchy fresh garlic.
Don't shove more than 3-4 cloves at a time in there.
Wow! What else can I say? This garlic peeler is the best invention since sliced bread! Peeling garlic now is so easy and quick.
I really recommend everyone to get this product.
How in the world did I get along without one?.
This item works beautifully without inflicting any damage on the garlic bulb.
It is easy to clean and stores away nicely.
I wasn't sure how well this would work, but I have to say that I am very pleased with it.
When I wanted peeled garlic without crushing the cloves I used to just roll them between my hands.
It's effective, but after several cloves it could take a couple days for my hands to recover.
While not perfect, for me this makes peeling garlic much easier and quicker.
This is best simple invention ever! We use garlic a lot.
This little thing saved me so much time and effort.
It's super easy to use, super easy to clean.
I can't believe that I didn't buy it earlier.
I recommended to all my friends and they all love it.
If you use a lot of fresh garlic, you'll love this.
Just drop a clove in, rub it between your hands a few times, and it's peeled.
A clever little gizmo that's easy to clean, too.
This simple design works great to peel garlic.
Just place a clove inside and rub the clove peeling the skin off instantly.
I bought one of these a few years ago and put it away until I moved to a new home.
I just ran across it several months ago.
I introduced it to my husband who loves using it.
I bought nine more to give as gifts this past Christmas.
Everyone has told me they enjoy using it.
It works really well and it is easy to clean.
This is a great item for removing the white papery stuff off garlic cloves.
Very useful for cooks who use fresh garlic.
This rubber cylinder does a good job of rolling off the skin of garlic.
Another tool for the frequent cook who uses a lot of garlic.
I would say costs next to nothing to make but they get good money for it.
Whoever invented this is going to make a mint!!!!!!!!.
Like seriously though, who knew??! LOL it's just rolled silicone or rubber but it's awesome.
I saw this on TV once, I can't remember where or what show, but someone used a little roller to peel garlic.
It does what it's supposed to do, it is relatively inexpensive and to my knowledge, most people never heard of it before.
I get a look from friends when they see it and they ask what the heck it's for.
So, besides working ,it also makes a interesting conversation piece in your kitchen.
Occasionally one stubborn odd shaped clove will not peel, but they are truly rare.
This is a handy little tool that does exactly what it says it will do.
If you put unpeeled cloves in it and roll it around the cloves will come out unpeeled.
Its pretty handy when you need to peel alot of garlic and also very nice to get kids involved with cooking.
And if i hadnt gotten it as a gift, i probably wouldnt have it.
I rarely use *SO* many cloves that getting out another kitchen tool feels warrented.
And garlic smell can be removed by washing with a stainless steel spoon.
a newlywed kitchen gift for a couple who hasnt already got a drawer full of gadgets.
for a family with children who want to get their children to partipate.
for a disabled person who has difficulty with working with knifes.
A friend bought one for me, and I liked it so much I bought several for gifts for friends who like to cook.
I'm not usually a fan of kitchen gadgets.
They take up space and anything they do can generally be done with a decent knife and standard knife skills.
When peeling garlic, the easiest method is the old-fashioned Julia Child technique; set your kitchen knife on top and give it a good smack.
Easy peasy.But!  This is only good if you don't care what the end product looks like.
The peel will come off, but the garlic will be squished and only good for dicing or pressing.
It is a kitchen gadget that actually works as advertised.
Put a clove in, give it a good roll, and the peel pops out one end and the fresh clove out the other.
You can just keep on rolling until all the garlic is done.
I use a lot of whole garlic, and my life has become so much better since I bought this.
I just sit by the table with a hundred or so cloves and roll them out.
It's easy to use and works every time.
Handle is comfortable, tines are more strudy than others.
So versatile I use it for sooo many kitchen cooking/baking tasks.
I'm loving it!!  The Norpro Grip-EZ Granny Fork is a perfect substitution for the Foley, might even be a little better in some areas.
First, let me say, if you want a Foley, head over to Ebay and be prepared to drop $30.00.
You can still get one in decent shape.
The Norpro though, takes what was so ingenious about the Foley and cranks it up a notch or two.
While I love my old standby, I usually only pull it out once a year.
It's tradition and a collectors item but it won't hold up to daily use any longer.
The sturdy rubber handle will take a beating and the business end of Granny will complete the job in no time at all.
The tines on the Granny are a little wider but not so much so to alter your finished product.
You can see from my picture (marks on Granny are light reflections)the difference is minimal.
Granny is happy in the dishwasher and I believe no cook should be without one.
It's the one kitchen item you didn't know you needed and will love.
I'm getting another for myself and a few more for friends.
This time of year, lots of bakers give mixes for the receiver to bake off at home.
Try substituting a Granny Fork for the typical wooden spoon that often gets tied to the packaging.
You'll make a huge impression and it will end up being a favorite for anyone lucky enough to receive it.
Norpro was thinking outside the box on this one and it shows.
One of the best not so "new" kitchen items out there and it's less than $7.00.
Good for blending dry ingredients, mixing, stirring, blending AND lifting.
I do a lot of crockpot cooking and at the end, I often want to remove all but liquid so I can thicken sauce/gravy.
This one tool is what I reach for.
My original impression was that the tines were flexible, not so.
A second one is on my wish list for next order.
I love the EZ Grip - now my wrists no longer hurt when mashing the beans while cooking!.
This is a nice solid "fork" that will serve us well as a whisk, folder, mixer, scoop...and oh yeah - fork.
I had been using an old kitchen fork to mash my tuna fish salad.
The fork worked fine but it's made of aluminum and I needed to get rid of aluminum in the kitchen because of its toxic effects.
It doesn't look as strong as my old fork but I was really amazed at how quickly it did the job.
It made an even smoother textured tuna fish salad and with really very little effort.
Plus, it's really attractive and as the working parts are made of stainless steel, there's no worry about toxicity.
What a clever little,tool, I use it for pie crusts to mixing home made pasta.
Is mixes things so easily scrambled eggs are a breeze, improbably use this fork 3-5 times a week.Extremely affordable it's many and diverse uses.
I remember my grandmother had one of these, and when I saw they were available I had to order one just for fun.
Whips eggs up beautifully and love how it mixes corn bread batter.
Amazing how well something so cheap can work and it just puts a smile on your face when you grab it from the drawer.
My wife thought this might make it easier for her to mix ingredients and she was right, as she often is.
I have really used this easy to grip nice length fork  a lot since it arrived.
Since I cook in cast iron its can be used in the pan with with no fears of scratching.
It  has mixed up meatloaf with no bending of the tines, whipped eggs and mixed batters  really endless uses.
I am cutting down on my kitchen utensils, this study fork now stays in easy reach.
I've searched for years for another 3 tine fork, but the ones I've found just aren't made like they used to be.
The tines look odd because they are made slightly offset, but the shape makes them work more efficiently.
Just got the granny fork yesterday, and after one use I was very impressed with it.
I can see already that I will be using it for a lot more than just browning ground beef.
I'd give this tool 10 stars because it is made to last!.
This Norpro Grip-EZ Granny Fork is a very handy kitchen tool to have.
My only idea of a "Granny Fork" was a small 3 pronged cooking fork with a wooden handle but this is NOT one of those.
I had never heard of the old "Foley Fork" that this item replaces until recently when I had seen Mz.
Julia using the old "Foley Fork" on some of her Cooking DVDs- so I decided to find one and give it a try.
The Foley's are no longer made and this is the closest one can come to one now-a-days.
This Norpro is very sturdy and well made.
The long stainless steel handle and body are solid and the E-Z grip handle is comfortable in the hand.
It works very well for shredding cooked beef or pork for hot sandwiches too.
I am very happy with this unique mixing tool! It is one handy gadget that is swiftly becoming one of my favorite kitchen tools.
Until I got it, I had no idea I needed it!.
After reading about it on a food blog, I bought this blending fork to bring my order total up to qualify for free shipping.
It's turned out to be one of those tools I reach for constantly.
It's particularly great for quick breads, muffins, or biscuits because it blends without over mixing.
It's also good for mixing the kinds of hot cereals that are fond of forming lumps, like Cream of Wheat.
My granny fork is still new, but appears to be solidly constructed, with a nice sturdy handle.
Besides using this for baking I have to say that my favorite way of using this product is when I am browning ground meat.
You can use spatulas, wooden spoons, anything and NOTHING will work like this fork.
It breaks apart the meat perfectly with NO effort at all and in record time.
This is one of my favorite kitchen gadgets of all time.
You'll love it and you can't go wrong with the price.
As a child, for years, I would watch my grandmother stir/mix-up her lemonade and orange juice with the funkiest fork I'd ever seen.
So I purchased this item with a happy heart and I love it.
I use this for a rinsing station for my yarn and fabrics once they have been dyed.
This tool gets heavy use and lives in my dye sink.
My first one lasted 4 years before it finally started to break down and I immediately purchased a second one.
For the average kitchen I suspect this would last a lifetime.
Yuck.The only negative, is that it is a pain to store, due to it's shape  and size.
However, if you are like me, it goes from use to dishwasher to  use again, so it's official storage place never gets used.
This product has been a real lifesaver for me.
Trying to juggle a heavy pan and a colander while cooking was very frustating.
Often, you can't set the colander down in the sink because you have other things in the sink.
With this colander, it is SO easy to drain pasta, ground meat, vegetables, etc.
as it rests on the edges of the sink.
It is also wonderful for washing fruits and vegetables.
I use mine daily and it has stood up to lots of use.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the little rubber feet kept coming off.
It wasn't a big deal, but they should've been secured better.
This product is a must-have for anyone who cooks.
I purchased this as a replacement for a sub-par colander that broke.
I was very pleased when this product arrived.
It is heavy-duty, supports weight well and is dishwasher safe.
I have a feeling this colander will be around for many more years.
The colander is heavy gauge stainless, so durable and the pasta slides out so easily after straining the pasta.
Sure wish more pans were this sturdy!!Highly Recommend!!!.
My wife loves these colander (bought 2 for her).
The handles are welded on so there's no rivets to fall out, and it's about the right size for the typical pasta mess.
Wow - I did not expect such quality on line.
This looks wonderful hanging from the pot rack.
After several washings, it has retained its bright silver appearance.
It strains fairly fine particles, is easy to clean and seems durable.
I couldn't have asked for a better colander.
Made of quality stainless steel this is a keeper.
Better than pre-molded plastic and worth every penny.
This colander is fairly small, but well suited to many functions from draining pasta to holding vegetables as they are being washed.
We use this item fairly often and it has held up well for many years.
This is the type of item where paying 3-5x or more for a name brand like All Clad doesn't make sense.
This colander replaces a similar antique colander that is aluminum.
I wanted one with the feet & had it in my saved wish list for about a year.
I had purchased this one for my daughter at that time & no complaints on its quality, etc.
I hang mine by its handle on a hook I have in a board on the kitchen wall above the stove.
UPDATE JULY 1 2012:My brother still has his Norpro 4 quart (8.5 inch Deep) and loves it.
I still have my MIU 6 quart and love it.
First, let's explore the differences and similarities between these three colanders.
My house was built in the 1980s and the sink is typical for kitchens of that decade.
Without the feet, just the colander from the center of the inside to the top is approximately 5 1/8".
I had to eyeball this measurement, so I did the best I could.
Drainage holes on the side are just shy of 3/16" in diameter while those on the bottom are just over 1/8" in diameter.
There are 300 holes along the side and 90 holes on the bottom, plenty for drainage.
The bottom is 4 1/4" in diameter, a full inch narrower along the bottom than the MIU France 6-quart colander.DURABILITYThe handle is welded on.
Each side of the handle appears to be welded at only two points.
I imagine the welding is quite strong, because I gave this exact colander to my brother several years ago, and he raves about it.
I can see my reflection in the bottom of the MIU France colander.
Due to the handles, this one will not fit inside my stockpot.
However, none of the three did.CAPACITYThis colander holds 4 quarts.
You cannot go wrong if you pick this colander.
It is a 5-quart instead of a 4-quart.
I don't particularly like the handles, but I have large hands.
The handles are a lovely rounded shape and larger than the Norpro handles, making it easier for my large hands to grasp them.
The MIU France's mirror finish interior is more highly polished than that of the Norpro colanders.
The bottom hole content varies, but not enough to make a difference in their handling of any drainage of food or liquids.
This in no way detracts from their beauty or functionality.
All three are excellent choices in colanders.PHOTOSSee customer images for photos of all three colanders for comparison.RECOMMENDATIONMy personal preference is the MIU FranceMIU-6-Quart-Brushed-Stainless-Steel-Colander.
I prefer the larger round handles, both functional and beautiful.
Also, since all three take approximately the same storage space, I would go ahead and spring for a 6-quart.
However, if you choose thisNorpro Stainless Steel 8.5 Inch Deep Colander, you have purchased a high quality colander that will last you for years.
This colander has good construction, a brightly-polished interior, sturdy handles and feet, and a nice spread on the drain holes.
I chose this one because it is taller and more narrow than most colanders.
And the size is not overwhelming -- I would not have wanted anything larger so the size is the greatest part for me.
Just a real nice colander that looks like it will last a very long time.
It is very heavy duty and very deep.
I like the wide handles on it because you can place it on top of a pot lined with cheese cloth for straining.
We have also used it for a large steamer.
place it on top of a stockpot with boiling water-instant steamer.
Got this one after accidentally purchasing an enormous 8 quart colander by accident that was very good, but too large.
I have had this only for a few weeks but have been impressed so far!.
Have had these over five years and could't be happier.
Amazon shipping was fast and Norpro quality is great.
It cleans easily and the holes are just the right size.
I can't say enough good things about this Norpro Stainless Steel colander.
It's worth paying a little more to get something with such high quality.
I've been using an antique (only because it's old -- not valuable) plastic colander for years.
However, I agree 100% with those who are taken with the "beauty" of this utensil.
I know that when using attractive sturdy utensils the preparation of any food becomes an enhanced aesthetic experience.
The food just tastes better and is more satisfying because the experience of preparation becomes a pleasure and not a chore.
It is, indeed, attractive enough to be a counter fixture that complements my white/stainless small appliances beautifully.
Come Halloween, I can also dress as a Viking and use my gorgeous colander as a helmet.
I have to agree with the previous reviewers, wowzers.
The interior has a beautiful mirror finish, and there are plenty of holes on the sides and bottom so it's functional too.
Also, the handles and legs are welded on, with no screws that might trap food particles (as on my old strainer).
It feels very sturdy!The 8-5/8 inch colander is very large, perfect for my needs.
Then you can also use it by itself to present fruits or vegetables, at dinner parties and such.
It's that nice!  Indulge yourself, it's worth it.
After our plastic colander finally cracked, I decided to purchase this stainless steel one.
It drains water effectively while keeping spaghetti inside.

Due to the handles, this one will not fit inside my stockpot.
However, none of the three did.CAPACITYThis colander holds five quarts.
There is slightly less room in the handle area for this handle than the MIU France colander.
I have somewhat long fingers and prefer the shape and size of the MIU France colander's handles.
Still, my hands do fit inside these handles.
The handles are a lovely rounded shape and larger than the Norpro handles, making it easier for my large hands to grasp them.

This is a substantial and great looking colander.
I was pleasantly surprised by how large and deep it is.
The brushed stainless with the polished stainless is very snazzy.
I first bought one for my daughter for Christmas, and became enamored with its shiny good looks and sturdy construction.
I had a very good quality plastic colander that my boyfriend brought to the relationship.
It's been as useful, steady and true as the boyfriend, but started showing its age without any corresponding increase in performance (unlike the bf).
So, since I'm not looking for a new bf, I ordered this shiny new colander and said &#34;good-bye&#34; to the old plastic one.
Not a lot to say about a simple product.
It is a great quality piece that is sturdy and stands up well to every day use.
Great quality, and perfect for all straining, washing vegetables or fruit.
much heavier than i thought it would be.
its awesome and should last a long time.
This is a heavy quality piece of kitchen equipment.
It's pretty large, so would be good for washing greens as well as draining pasta.
It looks like it will be easy to clean, unlike those made of wire mesh.
Glad I bought it, even if it is a bit expensive.
I got this colander as a replacement for my 30+ year old metal one when one of its legs fell off.
This colander is the same size as my previous one but is much heavier and seems more solidly built.
It drains well and so far I am pleased.
I'm hoping that I'll remain impressed for the next 30 years!.
This stainless steel strainer seems to be great quality, and is a perfect size.
The holes are the perfect size to let the water out but not the small food particles.
I DID THINK IT WAS RATHER EXPENSIVE, BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.
As a kitchen gadget junkie, I have to say that I am highly impressed with this particular item.
Most kitchen items get USED and abused in my household, so I try to buy the most heavy duty product out there.
The biggest issue with my previous collander was the depth of it.
I would pour out a pound of pasta, and about a third of it would spill out into my sink.
This collander is not only very wide, but also deep.
If you are looking for something that will probably outlast most of your other kitchen products, this collander will definitely do the trick.
I would give this 10 stars if I could!!.
I have had mine for years and it is the best colander I've owned.
Sturdy, good looking, well-designed, high quality stainless steel.
I just bought another one as a gift and was so pleased to see there were no changes in quality or design.
I haven't seen this colander anywhere but Amazon.
It's pretty large, but it cleans easily and I've been using it all the time for everything from veggies to pasta, and more.
The feet help it to sit up higher than my other collander.
Feels sturdy and I had not had any issues with it.
This colander is a good size and has excellent drainage.
The handles and legs make it easy to use and stable.
A big improvement over the plastic colander that I had been using.
I recieved and used this colander today and it works great, all the holes are in the right places, it drains quickly and completely.
This thing is beautiful and very strong, not flimsy at all.
Easy cleanup [I used a drop of dish soap and a soft sponge]  I caught it on sale for $29.04 with prime shipping.
Considering the quality and functionality of this colender that's a fantastic deal and worth every penny I paid.
This is not only great to look at, but seems to fit the bill when it comes to doing what it was created to do.
This colander is beautiful, sturdy and entirely functional.
I was looking for a quality stainless steel colander and found it with this one.
Although I use it almost daily, this could be something that gets passed down for generations.
I hate junky things so it's hard to buy on the dot-coms where you can't see and hold an item.
I took a chance on this colander and am absolutely happy I did.
It's quite heavy, made from thick gauge stainless.
It's stamped, not wire mesh so it's easy to clean.
This means that in the sink, it drains.
A ring base holds water under the base.Bottom line, if you are fussy about quality, buy this thing.
I would have paid twice the price and been happy.
If you are not fussy about quality, buy it anyway.
At this price, it's cheaper than many poorly made units and maybe it will teach you what quality is!.
Solidly built, looks great, and it's taken five years of use now with no problems - the welded parts are well-attached.
Unlike a lot of colanders, the design of this one doesn't leave many places where food can get stuck and be hard to clean.
Easy to use! Easy to clean! Easy to identify! Very good buy and well worth the money.
We bought this for measuring out additives for the livestock.
As soon as I saw the quality, I quickly replaced my (good) kitchen set with these.
Surprised by the heavy weight of the metal.
Wish it had the 3/4 and the 2/3's like my old plastic set.
But this is good because it had at least 1 more size than usual.
It also is the same volume in the cups as my previous set.
(Can't say that for some spoons I bought years ago.
Convenient shape and good quality, that's about all there is to these measures.
The 1/8th is useful and the shape is good for getting in to containers.
The snap ring is a good way of securing these in to a set.
All of them are made of stainless steel and they serve their purpose.
I am reviewing this set because I think it is a little different than what is out on the market.
they remind me of an egg with an even depth and a flat bottom.
They are well-built and fit in my kitchen drawer nicely.
Very nice set of SHINNY Stainless Steel Cups.
Just what I was looking for.I joined &#34;Amazon Prime&#34; last year and I have decided that this is the only way to shop.
The free 3 day shipping is terrific...and....if you need to contact Customer Service...the Amazon agents are terrific to work with :).
This set of measuring cups nests nicely inside of each other.
It is made of very durable and heavy stainless steel and I believe they'll last a lifetime.
The measurement markings are engraved on the handle and include US and metric.
There is also measurements engraved on the inside in both US and metric that show increments within that cup size.
Although the set doesn't include every single standard measurement, it contains most of the right ones.
If you want 2/3, you can use the increments in the 1 cup or two 1/3 cups.
Definitely a great buy and a quality set of measuring cups for a serious baker.
very durable and the handles are very sturdy.
I was nervous about getting this because compared to others the price was reasonable.
I am glad I did! The quality us great and the ring holding them together is easily removed.
build quality of these measuring cups are the best I have ever seen.
They are a really nice set with good finish.
I just received my Norpro Stainless Steel Measuring Cup Set.
I especially like the shape as it makes them easy to go into various boxes and containers.
I also really like the fact that it has 5 different sizes vs.
the standard 4 sizes that are offered with most measuring cup sets.
Great for whatever use you may need it for.
Other than that I would rate them 5 star.
The 1/8 cup size is a welcome addition although a 3/4 cup measure would probably get more use.
I had to return the first set because the handle on the smallest cup was NOT attached.
I love the elongated shape -- very easy to scoop.
These have a good weight and feel well-made.
I really like the inclusion of the 1/8 cup since I frequently halve recipes.
Good value and I'm very happy with the purchase.
These work so well! I've always had plastic ones and they kept breaking so I finally upgraded and I don't regret it!.
They stack well and the measurements are easy to read.
This is a great stainless steel pot that I use for many things.
You can use it as a double boiler too and melt chocolate on top.
I like the sturdy handle and thick stainless steel material.
Wish it was offered in a set so I would not have to keep buying individually.
I am buying pieces and storing for when my children move off to college.
It's very handy and doesn't take up much room.
I've used it as a mixing bowl, to boil water and to fill my water filter pitcher/dispenser.
The Norpro Krona Stainless Steel 8 Cup Multi Pot is a wonderful size and fits inside the 12-cup Multi Pot which I also own.
This has become my favourite pot for brewing up a batch of Masala Chai (Spiced Tea).
I must say the multi pot surprised me given the good price we found for it.
As every cost conscience consumer knows, quality and cost are always a factor.
It is always recommended that no one boil anything in any cookware any more because it shortens the life of the item.
Even the picture reveals it is a quality made product and looks are not deceiving in this case.
The closest in size to the bottom of the pot.
First time use was a little funky, because it had a few seconds of burn in.
I was amazed at how the handles stayed cool, as I was convinced they'd get hot.
I bought this little pot to abuse it and save my expensive cookware.
This pot is good quality for the price.
I like that you can buy it with or without a glass lid, as I had no need of a lid.
I will use this to boil the tea water and that is its dedicated use.
I bought this pot to make Indian chai and it does its job very well.
The base on this is heavy: it heats evenly.
Keep the flame within the diameter of the disc.
You won't use as much energy and your water/sauce/gravy, whatever, will boil!The only warning I would offer is a handling one and a cleaning one.
The handle does get hot, because the pot is not very wide, so heat rising up the side heats the extra heavy gauge wire handle.
You could wipe them away in a few cleanings if you're not careful.
Soak for ten minutes, use a nylon scrubby if needed for burnt milk or chocolate, and you're good to go.
Remember to keep the disc clean from any build up so you don't get hot spots!Great, useful little pot you'll go to often!.
This machine works wonderfully! Could not be easier! We have no previous experience and even our first batch was great.
The strong motor and strong freezer are why it works and why it costs as much as it does.
We're using Ciao Bella Book of Gelato and highly recommend the purchase of this book with the Lello.
works as well as it did 2 years ago.
This machine is heavy, noisy and not fun to clean.
Things changed when I purchased a great recipe book (Making Artisan Gelato) and my son and I tried our first 'gelato' batch.
I purchased this as a gift for my father and the whole family loves it.
It made the best vanilla bean ice cream I have ever tasted.
We then made mango peach sorbet and it too was incredible.
It's only been a few days but I think we have a new tradition - making fresh ice cream.Looks - Gorgeous mirror finish.
It takes up a lot of counter space but it'll be a conversation starter.Quality - Weighs a ton but top notch.
I'm betting it will last a few lifetimes.Ease - Two buttons (cold and stir) and a timer knob - simple.
The cleanup was quick.Results - The best tasting ice cream, sorbets, and sherbets you'll ever taste.
Makes just the right amount for a family to share over a few days.
Everybody has been thrilled with the ice cream we've made with it.Not cheap but worth it.
Homemade ice creams and gelatos from this machine are wonderful.But the machine is difficult to clean.
It would be a nearly perfect machine if the freezing bowl came out and you could pop it in the dishwasher along with the paddle.
Also, storing the machine can be a problem, it takes up a lot of counter space.
The problem with owning this machine is figuring out how to NOT use it.
:)Anyway, I almost had a heart attack when I got the box via UPS: it's huge.
Thankfully, most of that volume is from the packing material.
The ice cream maker is still big, but it's reasonable.
The quart and a half capacity is more than enough to keep the three of us in ice cream for several days.
The implication is that by putting the arrow onto the number, that's how long the timer runs: not quite.
The number is actually saying that this segment (marked by a bar on each side) is the 10s, or 20s, or 30s, etc.
So, if you want a 30 minute run (which is what we normally do), put the timer to the dividing line following the 30.
Also, there doesn't seem to be any way to stop the timer if you decide to stop the machine.
Attach a frying or candy thermometer to inside of pan.
Stirring occasionally, bring the mixture to 170 degrees F.
Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
Pour mixture into lidded container and refrigerate mixture overnight to mellow flavors and texture.
Personally, I think it's fine without the heating/refrigeration.
That recipe is modified from Alton Brown's "Good Eats" vanilla ice cream recipe on the FoodTV website.
This is the greatest ice cream maker for home use.
It makes 1.5 quarts in 30 minutes and the ice cream always turns out delicious.
Amazon had a sale on this item at considerably less than list price, and I decided to take a flyer and ordered one.
It arrived in fine condition.The item itself looks very presentable and will fit in with a high end kitchen containing stainless steel appliances.
From what you can see from the exterior, it appears to be well-built.
It was a battle to clean it and I always had trouble getting the bowl to release so I could remove it to clean.
It was such a pain to clean, that I stopped making ice cream.
Then I tried a Cuisinart ice cream maker where I had to store the bowl in the freezer.
And the huge, cumbersome paddle and the ice cream frozen to the sides and bottom made it very messy to clean.
So, I was afraid to spend the money on this Lello.
So easy to clean that I'm making more ice cream than ever before.
The quality of the stainless steel is wonderful to work with.
(Just don't overload the bowl to begin with.
For years my favorite ice cream cookbook has beenBen & Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream & Dessert Bookand those recipes work very well with this machine.
You don't want to be trying to lift it down from a shelf above arm-level.
It is also good to know that the black, heavy-duty cord is very long.I don't care how much this machine cost.
It is worth it, and our family is very happy to have it.
However, finding quality gelato in the US has been very difficult.
I am astounded at how inferior it is -- even places that get high ratings disappoint.
I tried gelato from many places -- Whole Foods sells it in tubs.
I can tell you truly gelato from Italy does NOT taste anything like the gelato we have here.
We found that even though the book says to let the gelato mix chill for 8 hours, we do not have to do that.
I have had this unit for ten years now and it is still going strong.
I use in now a days just about twice a month.
The reason I gave it only four stars is that it is pretty loud, the beater that is.
For instance I can't read or listen to the radio in between filling and emptying the machine.
Over all a great item if you love homemade frozen desserts.KDM.
I read the concerns about cleaning but figured that it would be ok.
Well the cleaning is not up to industry standard.
there is definately a sanitary concern and one will have to go to some lengths to be safe from food poisioning.
We lost the locking nut on ours and were somewhat taken back to find replacing it would cost us $20.
That's a pretty good lug nut on any truck in the fleet.
The machine makes great ice cream but we have smelled that electric smell of when an electric motor is overworking.
Bottom line is it makes great ice cream, but hold on to your lug nut.
My family thought I was nuts to spend so much money on an ice cream machine.
And I admit, I was wondering at first if I had gone a bit overboard myself.
But I have never regretted purchasing it ever since.This machine is a joy to use and makes making your own homemade ice cream a breeze.
You mix the ingredients, put them in the machine, set the timer, and start it up.
In about 30 minutes you have ice cream.
If you are like me, you have ice cream made from organic ingredients.Cleanup is a little tricky.
The big plus is that the bowl is smooth, rounded stainless steel--very easy to get clean and sanitary.
The minus is that the bowl is integrated with the body of the machine, so you can't take it out.
You need to let it sit in your freezer to harden it up a bit.
With this machine, I've developed my own delicious peppermint ice cream recipe, so I can enjoy its refreshing flavor any time of year.
One warning is that many of these recipes use raw eggs.
I can't believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is.
It not only churns out the best tasting ice cream, you really don't have to put in much effort to make it.
Since it contains the necessary "chilling" compressor, you never have to worry if you have the bowl chilled enough.
Clean up isn't bad if you tend to it right after using.It is a very heavy machine.
I would recommend it to anyone who loves home made ice cream and wants a fine machine to make it for you!.
I have had this machine for about 2 years, and it is excellent and very reliable.
The easiest technique is to use paper towels, which takes about 2 minutes total.
(1) Remove most of the ice cream with a spoon, and let the machine bowl warm up a little.
(2) Wipe out the bowl with 2 paper towels, after 3-4 rounds of wiping, the bowl will be spotless.
(3) Wipe it again with a lightly soapy sponge, or a damp towel.
Holy Cow this thing is expensive!  Your friends and family will make fun of you.
(yes I know you don't freeze bar-b-que but you know what I mean).
Update after two years:This continues to be one of my best "luxury" purchase.
It still gets used at least once a week, much more often in the summer.
It's also great way to easily store ripe fruit to use later in smoothies.
I've made 9 different kinds of ice cream/sorbet over the past 2 weeks and they have all been amazing.
In only 20-30 minutes, we have the most delicious dessert ever.
This is easy to use and makes perfect ice cream every time.
Tonight I'm going to try to make something similar with blueberries that we just picked.This machine is expensive, but worth the money.
Fast, sleek, sculpted and expensive.....now that's Italian! This is the ice cream maker for the serious player.
It is substantial (heavy!), magnificent and works wonderfully well.
Plug it in, load some cream, flavorings and fruit, and let it rip.
With its reassuringly quiet motor whirring away, it churns and chills a family-sized portion of surprisingly good ice cream in no time.
The only limit is your imagination (vanilla with white chocolate chunks and raspberries was great!) and your waistline.
It's big, weighs a ton, and is slightly noisy when running, but it produces wonderful ice cream.
I've never found the bowl-in-the-freezer machines to be able to freeze a rich ice cream base, but this guy handles it like a champ.
It has a strong motor, too, so it can keep on churning when the mixture is very thick.
Just for your reference, here's my ice cream recipe.
This will make TWO batches of vanilla base, so you can flavor each one differently.
Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until denatured and a bit lighter2.
If you're using vanilla beans, slice/scrape them and add them to the cream/milk.
Bring cream/milk to a boil, then remove from heat.
If you're using beans, let them steep in the hot cream for 20 minutes, covered with a lid, then reheat cream/milk to boiling.
SLOWLY pour the boiling cream into the egg/sugar mixture while whisking constantly.4.
Pour the mixture through a fine sieve to catch any curdled egg or vanilla bean pulp.
Chill the mixture for a few hours, then add the vanilla extract if not using beans.
The resulting texture will be better if the mixture is cold when you put it into the machine.6.
Bloom the gelatin in a little cold water for a few minutes, then melt it.
Try to get the gelatin as hot as you can without boiling it in the microwave.
QUICKLY pour all the gelatin into the ice cream base while whisking VERY briskly.
Just pour it through a sieve to catch the strings, and melt some new gelatin.
The ice cream will retain its smoothness for days this way.
Without using the gelatine as a stabilizer, it will turn grainy.7.
Add the mixture to the machine and churn until very thick, and the motor is straining slightly.
I bought this together with the book "Artisan Gelato".
So far, I have made chocolate, Hazelnut, Raspberry and Strawberry gelato.
Each has been the best gelato I have ever tasted.
The bowl required pre-freezing in freezer before use.
Fortunately, my KitchenAid broke and I bought the Lello.
I was concerned about paying so much for an appliance but the Lello is worth every cent.
I could never eat ice cream imediately after removing from the KitcheAid and would always have to freeze first.
We serve the gelato straight out of the Lello without having to freeze first.
I have had this for several years.This is a high quality unit that totaly meets my expectations.
You don't have to mess with salt or ice or putting a bowl in the freezer.
Also, the Musso creates a nice, creamy consistency.
I've even tried skim milk, sugar, salt, vanilla and a little chocolate.
I was suprised that even with skim milk the ice-cream had a nice texture and was creamy.
It was delicious!I used to think it was a pain to clean and wanted removable bowls.
I had already came up with a design to modify the unit.
Actually it's a preferable design since you never have to replace any seals or complete any other maintenance.
A very high quality machine that produces consistent results.
The plastic spoon they supply may be useful for removing ice cream, but doesn't work for softer deserts, which just roll off the spoon.
I use a small soup ladle, which is tedious.
As other reviewers have mentioned, this product would be improved if it had a removable, dishwasher safe mixing bowl.
THIS IS MY FIRST PURCHASE OF A PASTA MAKER.
I HAVE USED ALL  THE DIFFERENT PASTA DIES THAT CREATE THE SHAPE OF THE PASTA WITH NO PROBLEM.
THE TRICK HERE IS TO BE SURE YOUR DOUGH IS THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY, NOT TOO DRY AND NOT TOO STICKY.
I DID NOT KNOW IF I WOULD EVEN LIKE FRESH PASTA BUT I MUST SAY IT WAS WONDERFUL.
Making pasta is not like using a breadmaker.
You can't just put all of the ingredients in the machine and walk away.
But as an earlier reviewed observed, a large mail order company was selling it for 119 dollars including shipping.
I decided to give it a try.The PastaMatic 700MX operates differently than most models.
For one thing, you have to weigh your flour and carefully measure the egg mixture(I use Egg Beaters).
It takes longer to knead than my CTC too.BUT...it makes the best pasta I have ever tried.
The strands are much thinner than the CTC and a short dip in boiling water produces a superior pasta.
I have purchased additional dies from Lello and look forward to trying them.
My wife and I decided we wanted to make our own pasta.
Step one was to see what was on the market and what others liked (and didn't).
The Simac went to the top of the list very quickly.
Average price was $150 for a new or barely used machine with all the parts/manuals.
So I tried my luck...no good, and I hate the outrageous shipping charges.
Went to Google again and did a deeper search.
Ah ha, a big name retailer had them in their clearance section for $119 (wow) with free shipping (FedEx home delivery no less).
I ordered it on Tuesday night and it arrived on Friday afternoon...double wow.
Due to the issues we read about below, we decided to RTFM first.
However, we also decided to go with a recipe for tomato pasta from the recipe book.After we washed all the parts, we assembled the ingredients.
We sifted it as directed and put in the other ingredients.
Pushed the button, and added the water slowly as directed.
The pasta was too wet so we added a tbs.
of flour (as directed) and let it run 3 minutes more.
We had to add about two more tbs.
of flour to get it in the &quot;walnut sized balls&quot; stage.
During this time, something strange happened that I'll describe at the end.
Finally, we ran hot water over the die we wanted while extruding 2 &quot;golf ball&quot; sized lumps without the die in place (as directed).
The pasta was &quot;ragged&quot; on the edges, but after the first foot or so it cleared right up.
The pasta (linguini) only took 45 seconds to cook.
It tasted good, but I am now aching to try some semolina :)The weirdness:We have GFCI plugs in the kitchen (as is code).
After the first 10 minutes of kneading, the GFCI tripped? They should only trip if the HOT (120VAC) is connected to the ground.
I didn't smell any burning so I moved the machine to a non-GFCI outlet to complete the process.
The two switches are in series (if either opens then no current will flow) and most manufacturers switch the HOT side.
When I opened the unit up, I saw that they were switching the neutral side.
The HOT wire had become pinched between the case and the very hefty gearbox (metal BTW) and was shorting to ground.
This completed the circuit to the motor so it would run but bypassed the switches too.
I wire tied the offending wire out of harm's way and all is well.
The motor on this machine is massive and I am positive that running it like that did no harm.
After seeing the quality of the insides, I am also positive this machine will last a lifetime.Jay.
We make a lot of pasta at our house.
Any of the three will make acceptable pasta dough.
Take your flour rock and wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for a half hour or more.
Regardless of the machine, your 10th batch will be easier, faster, and tastier than your first.
So give yourself a learing curve and go learn something new.
You don't have to worry about noodles sticking together, to the machine, or to anything else.
Flour the cloth cover and you've got sturdy, clean elbow room without emptying your crowded cabinet tops.
the perfect warmer set for your nights that you are serving something that needs heated butter.
I bought quite a few for a lobster and crab night and each person had their own.
I put butter and garlic in the warmer and everyone loved them.
I'm sure there will be quite a few sales just based on my party.
These are fun to use and they DO keep your butter warm - however, they also can burn the butter if you're not careful.
Feel like you're dining out with these lovey warmers.
Even though I may not have a LOT of use for these little butter warmers, I consider them essential for when I DO need them.
Plus the little crocks are handy to use by themselves.
I even use them for making single serving desserts in my microwave.
Tired of cold butter or broth? This is the answer and they light up any table.
If you are a seafood lover, this is what you need.
I ordered these for a lobster tail dinner and was not disappointed.
Perhaps if one uses the larger tealights they might be too big and cause some scorching.
The large bowl allows for a lot of melted butter to be served.
The stand is sturdy, the bowls are attractive and blend in with any china or everyday dishes.
Candle flame is low enough the butter will not scorch and burn.
I bought these along with the Norpor 1527 Shanghai Crab scissors for a dinner party that I was having with friends.
The crab scissors are wonderful and having these cute butter warmers to keep the butter melted was great.
Well, someone listened and they now come with the candles in the metal tins and clean up was a breeze.
Would definately recommend to anyone needing melted butter kept warm.
We bought this for King Crab Legs and the price.
I love using this set when we have crab legs or lobster.
I like to add a pinch or two of herbs or garlic to the butter as it melts for added flavor.
It definitely gets the job done and adds a nice classy touch to the table.
The quality is good, if not the best.
The jar lifter, for example, is a little less hefty than what I had before and I didn't really need another set of Tongs.
However, they get the job done and the price was far less than buying each item individually.
I liked this set so well I bought another one just to get the canning funnel.
I only use the funnel so I can't review the other things.
I had got a different metal funnel but it had a inward lip at the bottom that I did not like.
I like plastic better and this one has no lip, just a smooth shute.
If you are going to can, you NEED these implements.
It cuts time, mess, and bandaids (for the burns).
The price on this kit is good compared to others.
Just what I expected when I ordered it.
High quality that will remain durable for many years of canning.
This ia a very handy collection of the basic tools needed to make home canning safe and easy.
Great price and certainly much less expensive than those in stores.
While these are not professional grade items they are certainly more than adequate for the casual home canner.
A great place to start and should last many years.
I ended up with a mess, and always burned my hands.No more!!!!!!  I may even buy this set for my dad who also "improvises".
The set was the same as I remember my mother using when I was a child over 50 years ago.
The materials are good quality and are very easy to clean.
Fantastic price for several helpful items, and all in one place.
Maybe you could spend your days searching garage sales for a few of the items and beat the price.
However, it doesn't get any more convenient than this.
If you are debating the "necessity", don't be mislead; buy it.
I can see where the other poster is coming from with the handy chop stick tip.
To that I just have to say: I could also make a fire with two sticks, but why???.
Pasta (of any kind) cooks great, vegatables, potatoes, you name it.
Over the years I have lost some of the accessories for it but still have the pot, basket and lid.
I think it is time for a new one!.
This cooker works as well as our last cooker for cooking rice; we have never used them for pasta.
The handles are a little tight so not sure how long they will last.
Our last cooker had to be replaced because one of the handles broke.
This peice is very good and rice cooks very fastly and also nicely.It comes with an additional basket for vegetables which is very nice.
I bought this pretty much exclusively to cook sweet (aka sticky or glutinous) rice.
Again, I let the rice simply sit for 20 minutes before opening the lid.
I had this set a while back and lost the outer pot in a move.
I loved this thing but I forgot the name, etc.
After years of doing without it I finally have it back.
Normally I steam rice in a bamboo steamer but it takes a long time and you have to soak rice etc.
For the whole brown rice with the bran intact this cuts down cooking time & effort in half.
That is the only thing that would make it absolutely perfect!.
It works even without the steamer basket or the small round steamer insert.
It does a good job of steaming potatoes and raw vegies well and it's so easy to clean.
Bought this as a gift for a college freshman and she loves it.
They can use it to cook almost anything in the microwave.
I use it to make Mac&Cheese.; I use it to make pasta.
I've used it to make rice or Ramen.
I use it virtually anytime I have something I want to microwave that doesn't go on a plate or in a single serve bowl.
Or you can put a little bit of water in the bottom and steam things, which works well.
While I can cook following my own experience and cookbooks, I'm never exactly sure how the inner lid is supposed to be used.
And so far, the 1-cup amount of long grain brown rice I've cooked has turned out just fine.
The first time, I cooked the water at 100% for 5 minutes like another reviewer suggested, then added the rice and finished it at 70%.
I got a small amount of spillage on the microwave turntable, but nothing a quick swipe of a sponge wouldn't take care of.
The second time, I started the rice cold and cooked at 70% for the entire 30 minutes; same thing.
I especially like the pasta drainer insert, because I can use it as a colander when I'm washing up veggies in the sink.
That's what we had for lunch, and it was simple, cheap, and yummy.
Moving into our RV I wanted to learn some microwave meal options.
I purchased this item thinking it would suck, but it was only $15 so the price was worth testing.
Second was steam fresh veggies and these came out awesome.
Then the real test for me was rice.
Using 1 1/2 Cups Jasmine Rice, 2 1/2 Cups Water, Salt to Taste.
I'm very happy with this gadget and was pleasantly surprised.
I have one of these and it's many, years old.
All I have left is the bowl and the lid ( have no idea where the other pieces went to ).
I cook potato casseroles in it too - the boxed kind and home made.
I have a very low wattage microwave and start with 3 min.
on 5 for rice - no over flow and perfect rice.
And I always cook boxed casseroles lower than the directions say because of over flow.
I love this dish because of the high sides and use it for many frozen vegies too.
I have never cooked pasta in but after reading all the reviews, I will now.
I never make rice on the stove and always use the microwave.
This product offers a much larger capacity than my Pampered Chef brand so i can double the recipe without spillover.
I keep two or three of these on hand.
They are an excellent inexpensive gift when you visit someone.
And for some people, those are both challenging endeavors, and I hate rice when not done properly.
There are very few products for which I will give a five star recommendation.
I received this cooker many years ago as a gift and did not use it at first.
This little microwave pot does it exactly right.
I have steamed vegetables in it, cooked pasta, and of course loads of sticky rice.
If you follow the instructions, you really can't screw up with this one.
I did learn to set my microwave at 70-80% before cooking or the rice would boil over and leave a sticky mess in the microwave.
Definately a must have for any kitchen that needs fast, healthy meals m/ a microwave.
Love this item, I use along with the sushi maker, easy to use and easy clean up, life can't get any easier.
I don't cook rice all that often, so I've only used it once for that and followed the guidelines given with the cooker.
I've used it many times for potatoes, broccoli, butternut squash, and apples.
In all cases, I wash the vegetable or fruit thoroughly, don't bother to pat it dry, and then cook it without adding any additional water.
You don't need to add any more water, because this is a steamer.
In the case of squash I peel and remove seeds and cut it up.
Whether I cut up other things depends on what I am using it for after cooking.
Then I microwave on high until the food is cooked.
I usually use the basket insert, and pull that out, drain any liquid out of the cooker.
There usually isn't a lot.With the apples, I mash them in the cooker, skin and all, and make applesauce.
It doesn't take much, because I don't want it super sweet.
I also usually add cinnamon and freshly-grated nutmeg.
For all of these, you have only 3 or 4 pieces to wash.
No big kettle and hot water to deal with.
I was so impressed I bought each of my sister's one.The cooker is easy to clean and I use it frequently.
Let it clog up someone else's kitchen cabinet! Meanwhile I will be using my rice cooker!.
I had bought another type that didn't have the strainer and didn't fit one whole box of pasta.
For the price you truly get a lot.
So easy to clean and fits in any microwave.
I have a medium sized one and it fits with space to spare.
I bought this many years ago , at lease a dozen, at Walmart.
I didn't have it long when the locking handles broke, but that's never been a problem.
I lift it by the built in ones.
I do use it constantly to steam vegetables.
It does a fast, great job, and lifting out the steamer insert drains them.
I steam regular and sweet potatoes and they cook very fast (7 min for average, longer for large).
I'm ordering a new one because mine is showing it's age, not because it's no longer useful.
When I changed my diet a while back, I knew rice would be an important factor in it.
So I found this rice cooker on amazon.
Used it two nights ago and was very pleased with it.
Followed the directions, made the amount of rice I wanted and then added my vegetables to it after it set some.
Perfect !!!! A delicious meal for me :)))) A very,very good buy !!!!.
I have enjoyed using this for rice, but the pasta was a bit of a bummer on my first try.
Now I can't find the booklet, so I forgot how much rice to water to use....no biggie.
Unit comes with every thing you need for cooking rice, pasta, and steaming vegetables.
Nested storage [space is a premium in RV].
but the steamer is exactly what I wanted.
The steamer is lightweight, the locking lid feature is handy when moving it in and out of the microwave, and it's easy to clean.
I put it into the dishwasher on the top rack with no heat.
I COOK in my microwave, not just heat/reheat food most times because I don't like heating up the kitchen using the electric stove and oven.
With this 100+ degree heatwave our power grid has been stressed requiring limited electric usage from 3-7 PM each day to avoid brownouts/blackouts.
So dinner is either a cold meal or something that can be made in the microwave.
As usual I came to Amazon for ideas and help, a reviewer was kind enough to scan and post them for us to use.
This is sooo worth having and giving it a try.
You'll use less electricity and not heat up your house while trying to stay cool and eat a decent meal.
With high electricity costs eating out isn't an option.
You can't beat the price for all the items you receive in this set.
It definitely is a must have for the microwave cook!.
My main inspiration for this was the pasta cooking ability, though it does much more.
But after trying things likePasta N Moreetc., this is far superior.
Put the inner lid over the basket, then the locking cover.
No waiting for water to boil, no oil or salt to add, just remove the lid lift the basket, your automatic strainer, and serve.
Microwave a mug of sauce, and you're done.
Easiest cleanup.There's also the option to steam vegetables with an insert, and of course, rice.
Also comes with 6 measuring cups, 4 measuring spoons, rice paddle and a nifty spaghetti measurer.At the list price, it's a bargain.
But currently part of the 4 for 3 deal.
But 3 get one free, mix and match products.
No brainer gifts for not just yourself, but great for students etc.
Got mine at a kitchen store for less than $10.
Beyond the rice cooker you get a strainer for pasta, a rack for steaming, a pasta measurer, measuring cups and spoons and a rice paddle.
The "extras" alone would cost $10 and would come in handy for someone without an already "set up" kitchen.
So far we made rice and pasta in the gadget.
Both were very easy to make and both came out great.
Rice has to be hydrated so you don't save a lot of time.
What you do save is worry as you just put it into the micro, set it and forget it.
Unlike our regular rice cooker, there is no burnt bottom and clean up was simple.
I have only made "single servings" of pasta but the cooker did a great job.
The openings on the strainer are a bit large so don't shake your spaghetti too vigorously as some may slip out.
Have not steamed veggies yet.It isn't tiny so it may not fit in a super compact micro.
We have a 1200 (or is it 1300?) watt oven so we need to cook the rice at 70% power to prevent over boil.
It is made of plastic so don't do any cooking with oil in it as oil heats more than water and will melt the thing.
In fact, I would probably NOT use it to complete meals in it.
I would only use it to make rice, pasta and steam stuff.A great deal.
Useful, even if you have a regular kitchen.
I am buying my 3rd one of these.
it did great for over 5 years - and this last issue was my error.
rice is always perfect - never mushy etc.
i cook basmati rice in it - 13 min on high - 1 cup rice, 2 1/2 cups water, dash of salt.
I never thought this would solve all my problems.
I use mine for everything from steaming vegetables to cooking steel cut oats and other grains.
There is little that can go wrong with the cooker.
The lid fits tightly and the basket increases the options for using the cooker.
I wish it was sold by Amazon with measuring cups and spoons as I already have both.
However, the price is good and I find Progressive products hold up quite well, so I will pass the measuring devices on to someone else.
Great bargain for the many components you receive, even though I would have been happy with just the main container and rice spoon.
We have not tried it to make pasta yet.
It makes perfect basmati rice in the microwave: 20 minutes for 3 cups rice + 4.5 cups water.
It has been used and washed a few times now and is still in great condition.
I bought this just for the microwave steamer function.
This one is very similar and I expect it will be just as durable.
The measuring spoons and cups were a useful little bonus.
My last product like this lasted 10 years and this one looks like a better quality product.
It's big enough to cook 3 large stuffed artichokes or a bunch of broccoli.
This works for steaming not for pasta so for that i give it four stars since i have steamed more vegies since i got it.
This little gadget is the best cooking item I have ever owned.
I recommend it for anyone and everyone.Update 2012: Sadly our microwave steamer now awaits a recycling facility.
I really don't believe it's the manufacturer's fault, rather ours for not adjusting the cooking times.
From now on we'll either cut cooking times by 30% or cook with the sensor.
I had to have this set as my Mom has it and it works great for veggies.
Very good set of basic tools for the kitchen.
I have used this to cook rice with excellent results.
I haven't used it to cook pasta, but I am confident that it would be easy.
The set includes everything you need to make several easy dishes in the microwave.
Whether you are a homemaker or a college student, this will change the way you do things and make dinner a lot easier to prepare.
It is fool-proof for making rice, but I use it for steaming and blanching vegetables a lot, too.
You can also make any sorts of microwavable rice meals, too.
Everyone tells me later they weren't sure they'd use it at first, but loved it as soon as they did.
I am actually on my second one, we used it so much.
The measuring cups and other accessories are still very much used here, too.
The spoons are standard and only go down to 1/4 tsp., if that helps anyone to know.
I make rice while I am doing other things in the kitchen.
Great way to make perfect rice every time (or other grains), without having to employ a stand-alone rice cooker.
I've had a microwave steamer for over 20 years, but with age and use the old steamer finally needed replacing.
I selected this unit due to the low cost.
I was surprised at the quality of the product.
I have not used it for cooking pasta and probably won't, but for veggies it works great.
My only complaint about this product is that it stained the first time I used it.
I steamed Sweet Potatoes with water and the pot now has a orange discoloration ring inside.
I tried to clean it but the ring would not come out.
Have not cooked rice or pasta with it.
Ihave never been able to cook rice well.It turned out the best rice I have everhad.
I wasn't expecting much because theprice was so low.
It is justone of the best values ever.
The problem was, being only 6 cups, I couldn't keep rice around.
This one is big enough to make my rice and stash the rest in the frig.
Each day, I just pull it out and pop it in the nuker to re-heat it.
It works great!If you're even thinking about this cooker, think no more! Just get it.
The price is right, Amazon's got you covered and you're gonna love it!.
I use this almost exclusively for preparing homemade french fries.
I like to blanch my fries before deep frying and this has helped cut initial prep time down to a few minutes.
The result is individual fries of consistent size that cook at the same speed.
I love this!  We had one years ago when I was growing up, dont know what ever happened to it.
But this one is surprisingly sturdy, that was my only concern when I purchased it.
I bought this on a whim and I totally loved it.It easily cuts potatoes and it easily sets up and breaks down for cleaning.
I am not very strong in the arms and yet I find I am able to cut the 'taters' with this very easily.
If you have large potato you will have to cut it into smaller sizes in order to fit into this cutter.
That is the only con that I can share with you.If you make french fries or sweet potato fries, this is the tool to use.
We do parboil our sweet potatos before cutting them.This is one item I would buy again if we were to lose this one.Enjoy.
It was wonderful for shaving hard cheese on pasta and you could use less, which is great for dieting.
